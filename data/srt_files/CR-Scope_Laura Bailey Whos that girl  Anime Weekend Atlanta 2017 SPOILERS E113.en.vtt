00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:12.352
[dramatic music]

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:16.445
LAURA: Okay! I'm going to stand here! Hi!

00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:18.182
AUDIENCE: Hi!

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:24.878
LAURA: Can you still see me? Is this worse for you
guys, or is this okay? Okay.

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:28.788
Hi, I'm Laura. What's going on? Ah!

00:00:28.788 --> 00:00:33.225
(gasping and laughter)

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:38.535
LAURA: All the light! So, what do you guys want to
do?

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:40.494
(laughter)

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:44.593
LAURA: Just hang out? Should I answer some
questions or something? Do you have questions for

00:00:44.593 --> 00:00:52.382
me? All right, cool! If you have a question, raise
your hand. You're first! If you want to, you can

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:58.648
go to that fabulous microphone so everybody can
hear you, but I'm thinking everybody can hear you.

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:02.697
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you in Shin Chan. It's my
favorite.

00:01:02.697 --> 00:01:03.722
LAURA: (as Shin) Thanks.

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.283
(laughter)

00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:10.171
AUDIENCE MEMBER: There are over 900 episodes in
Japan. Is there any chance you all will be dubbing more?

00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:20.243
LAURA: I don't think so, because I live in
California now. If they did, it would be very

00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:25.276
hard. Plus we had this fabulous group of writers
coming together for the first season that was the

00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:34.681
writers on Space Ghost Coast to Coast. I know,
right? They came in and did that. In the second

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:42.034
season we just had our awesome writers at
Funimation, but the actual creator of Shin Chan

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:49.703
passed away. I'm going to stand. That's better.
The actual creator of Shin Chan passed away. When

00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:58.007
he was alive, he was cool with us going off on the
show. They said we could take the animation-- as

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:03.116
long as we kept the characters consistent, we
could interpret the animation however we wanted

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:09.974
and make the show into what it was. Then, once he
passed away, they got a lot more strict with what

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:16.765
they were willing to let us do, so the show
plateaued on that.

00:02:16.765 --> 00:02:18.536
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, I'll always love what we
had.

00:02:18.536 --> 00:02:24.842
LAURA: (as Shin) Aw. We had a beautiful time
together! I'll love you forever.

00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:26.664
(laughter)

00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:31.207
LAURA: Next question! Yes, you.

00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:35.046
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello!

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:35.837
LAURA: Hi!

00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:42.966
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi there. In Saints Row, the
character you played actually had six or seven

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:49.200
different potential voices. Did you do anything to
make yours stand out, or did they tell you "this

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.434
"one's going to be a little different somehow" or
different script writing?

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:59.174
LAURA: No, well actually-- Okay, so that game was
awesome, because he would write to our

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:06.073
personalities. So once we did the first couple
sessions, Steve, who was our voice director and

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:13.859
our writer on the show-- he's just amazing. I had
the tendency-- Are there any small kids in here?

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.324
Because we're talking about Saints Row!

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.734
(laughter)

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:23.633
LAURA: I have specific cuss words that, for some
reason while I'm recording, come out, and I don't

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:27.403
understand why! So instead of just saying, "Ah,
shit!" it'll be like,

00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:29.602
"Ah, fuck me running!" for some reason!

00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:30.564
(laughter)

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:37.003
LAURA: That's what I say when I screw up a line!
He wrote that into my character, which is awesome,

00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:44.145
and then things like Mimosa Monday that we ended
up putting in Saints Row when we were the

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:50.626
President, that was something we actually did when
we were recording. We would have Mimosa Mondays.

00:03:50.626 --> 00:04:00.563
We declared that in the game too, which was
awesome. Then Troy Baker played the male default

00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:12.010
one voice, if you will, and he did most of the
base recording in Saints Row the Third. When we

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.489
would go into cinematics, we would match his
timing, but we'd have to put our own personalities

00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:24.343
on timing that he already did. Troy is a
phenomenal actor, and sometimes I think that he

00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:31.343
intentionally will screw with a line just to screw
with everybody else. So if the line was, "WIll you

00:04:31.343 --> 00:04:35.517
"get over here?" He would be like, "Will you just,
ugh, will you, ugh, will you get over here?"

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:41.155
(shouting) And then we'd have to match that stupid
timing! So every person then– Well, I had it easy

00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:46.483
because I had an American accent, but other people
had a Russian accent, or Hispanic, and they had to

00:04:46.483 --> 00:04:54.191
match that. It was very fun. But on the Fourth
when I was the President, I laid down the base

00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:57.953
track, so I would intentionally screw up the
timing so that Troy would have a hard time.

00:04:57.953 --> 00:04:59.259
(laughter)

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.522
(applause)

00:05:00.522 --> 00:05:01.357
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you very much.

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:05.700
LAURA: Thank you. Yes, second row.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:14.579
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I know I'm not the only one here
who knows you mainly from Critical Role.

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:16.032
LAURA: Yeah! Critical Role!

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:18.543
(cheering)

00:05:18.543 --> 00:05:20.382
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Final battle next week!

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:24.353
LAURA: I'm sweating. I literally started
sweating.

00:05:24.353 --> 00:05:29.489
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I asked the same question at
Travis' panel yesterday, so the same question for

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:33.997
you: when the new campaign comes along, can you
give us any hints on what

00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:36.525
type of character you're going to play?

00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:38.598
LAURA: What did he do?

00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:40.581
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He said he was going to be--

00:05:40.581 --> 00:05:42.943
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Race and basic class.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.421
LAURA: He did?

00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:49.244
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He hinted that he's probably
going to play a cleric, paladin,

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:50.755
or some form of caster.

00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:54.493
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to be honest with you guys,
because we're an intimate group in

00:05:54.493 --> 00:05:57.306
here with the camera running. I see you.

00:05:57.306 --> 00:05:59.591
(laughter)

00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:05.516
LAURA: So I want to be a cleric! Okay? I was like,
"I'm going to be a cleric!" I planned this <i>whole</i>

00:06:05.516 --> 00:06:12.772
character! I'm going to be a cleric. Then Travis
is like, "Hey, I'm thinking about being a cleric,"

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:16.162
and I was like "Travis, I already talked to you! I
was going to be a cleric," and he's like "Yeah, I

00:06:16.162 --> 00:06:21.816
know, sweetie. I think I want to be a cleric." And
I was like, "Okay. You be cleric, because that's

00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:25.856
cool. I'll play another character." So then I make
another character, and as soon as I come up with

00:06:25.856 --> 00:06:28.283
that one, he's like, "That looks like a fun
class."

00:06:28.283 --> 00:06:31.084
(laughter)

00:06:31.084 --> 00:06:36.524
LAURA: It took freaking all night to make that!
I'm like, "Travis Willingham, you stop it!" so I

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:43.072
am <i>literally</i> waiting on him to make his damn
decision before I can set my character, because if

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:48.252
he's not going to be a cleric then I'll be a
cleric. But if he is a cleric, then I have another

00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:50.342
one that I can't tell you.

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:51.580
(laughter)

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.120
LAURA: I do want to have spells. I will say that
much.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.345
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Awesome, very cool.

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.815
LAURA: Yes, with the camera!

00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:17.524
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is the genderbent Lust that
talked to you yesterday--

00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:18.783
LAURA: Yes, I remember!

00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:23.945
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If there's any voice actors that
you have never gotten to work with that

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:28.663
you'd love to work with, who would those be?

00:07:28.663 --> 00:07:41.723
LAURA: Who I never got to work with? I've worked
with a lot of people! I would have said Mark

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:44.088
Hamill, but I worked with him now.

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:48.353
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What did you work with him on?

00:07:48.353 --> 00:07:52.852
LAURA: I worked with him on the Regular Show,
which was on Crunchyroll.

00:07:52.852 --> 00:07:55.080
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What was that like, working with
him?

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:02.793
LAURA: Amazing! The most amazing thing ever. It
was right before the new Star Wars was

00:08:02.793 --> 00:08:12.833
announced, so I'm sure he was so excited and
didn't say anything. Nobody knew. Then another

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:17.695
time I ran into him at another studio but I didn't
say hi because I was too shy. He was walking down

00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:26.733
Hollywood, I was walking in the other direction,
and we had like a-- It was so amazing!

00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:31.072
Yeah, I don't know!

00:08:31.072 --> 00:08:34.773
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Did you ever get to work with
Ashly Burch or Tara Strong on anything?

00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:39.148
LAURA: Yeah, I've worked with both them a bunch.
Like, both of them are amazing. Amazing people and

00:08:39.148 --> 00:08:44.188
amazing actors. Ashly's been on Critical Role!

00:08:44.188 --> 00:08:44.980
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh yeah.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.163
LAURA: So that's even better.

00:08:47.163 --> 00:08:48.543
(laughter)

00:08:48.543 --> 00:08:53.053
LAURA: Then she won an Emmy. I don't know if you
see the correlation there, but there definitely

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:56.793
is. Thank you!

00:08:56.793 --> 00:08:59.244
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:05.584
LAURA: Hi, you in front. Sure, yeah, why not?
Because it's fun, right?

00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:10.553
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First of all, I just want to say
thank you. I've been waiting forever to

00:09:10.553 --> 00:09:15.412
meet you and Travis, so this is awesome. Also,
happy late anniversary since you posted on twitter--

00:09:15.412 --> 00:09:17.983
LAURA: Thank you! Six years, y'all!

00:09:17.983 --> 00:09:21.923
(applause)

00:09:21.923 --> 00:09:25.704
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Also, this is kind of more of an
anime type of related question.

00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:26.702
LAURA: Okay.

00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:33.354
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you had to be in any shounen
universe that you voice a character in,

00:09:33.354 --> 00:09:37.248
you don't have to be your character, just in that
universe, what one would you like to be in?

00:09:37.248 --> 00:09:38.784
LAURA: Fruits Basket.

00:09:38.784 --> 00:09:41.443
(cheering)

00:09:41.443 --> 00:09:47.566
LAURA: Only because the men can turn into animals!
Was that even a choice? Because it's basically our

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:49.883
world, just like one little pocket of cool.

00:09:49.883 --> 00:09:51.242
(laughter)

00:09:51.242 --> 00:09:56.042
LAURA: I would want to know them. And hug them.

00:09:56.042 --> 00:09:58.609
(laughter)

00:09:58.609 --> 00:10:06.105
LAURA: You next. Yes.

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:14.843
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Pardon me. Do you ever miss
working on the BlazBlue series? I know that the

00:10:14.843 --> 00:10:19.749
last game didn't have an English dub. What was it
like when you found that out, and what was your

00:10:19.749 --> 00:10:23.102
favorite moment dubbing from those games?

00:10:23.102 --> 00:10:36.074
LAURA: Oh, gosh. My favorite moment-- Jeez, it was
so much fun to get to play such a weird character

00:10:36.074 --> 00:10:41.644
that fought with myself, basically. That's always
fun, when you get to go back and forth with your

00:10:41.644 --> 00:10:49.773
own dialogue, because you control the conversation
completely. Yeah, that was a lot of fun. I didn't

00:10:49.773 --> 00:11:00.272
realize that there was a project that we didn't
get to dub, but now I'm sad. Womp womp.

00:11:00.272 --> 00:11:02.792
AUDIENCE MEMBER: AkSys is being lame.

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:05.992
LAURA: That's right. Thank you.

00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:15.034
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sorry, I'm short. First of all, I
want you to know I started crying when you and

00:11:15.034 --> 00:11:17.283
Travis announced you were coming to Atlanta.

00:11:17.283 --> 00:11:19.403
LAURA: Don't cry!

00:11:19.403 --> 00:11:24.932
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was so excited! Two questions.
I haven't played season two yet of

00:11:24.932 --> 00:11:30.672
Telltale: Batman. Poison Ivy?

00:11:30.672 --> 00:11:34.446
LAURA: What, am I going to give you spoilers or
something?

00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:38.833
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, then, one you can answer,
since I know you love the quarter-elves so much,

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:42.712
do you have names picked out for the little de
Rolo babies?

00:11:42.712 --> 00:11:47.370
LAURA: I can't do that yet! I can't go there.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.323
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do they have lots of kids or
none? Because Percy had a big family.

00:11:52.323 --> 00:11:58.743
LAURA: I think he'd want-- I don't know! I'd
really like two kids.

00:11:58.743 --> 00:12:00.779
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Two or seven?

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:06.800
LAURA: Two or seven. Either one. Man, I can't come
up with seven freaking names.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.062
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You'd be surprised! Some of us
have 40 D&amp;D characters.

00:12:11.062 --> 00:12:18.222
LAURA: Your name is Titty Sprinkles. Your name is
Chalupa. Your name is-- Thank you.

00:12:19.203 --> 00:12:21.069
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You guys were so cute at the
beginning of Talks Machina, by the way.

00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.822
LAURA: What?

00:12:21.822 --> 00:12:24.504
AUDIENCE MEMBER: When you guys came in for Talks
Machina, you guys were so cute with the flowers!

00:12:24.504 --> 00:12:29.965
LAURA: Wasn't that adorable? It's so fun coming up
with those little skits every single time before

00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:32.372
the show. I love it.

00:12:32.372 --> 00:12:33.279
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:38.663
LAURA: Thank you! You. Yes.

00:12:42.123 --> 00:12:42.732
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Laura.

00:12:42.732 --> 00:12:43.729
LAURA: Hi!

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:47.424
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've got a two-part question,
nothing extensive. The first one is: if you have

00:12:47.424 --> 00:12:52.565
to do voice work that's outside of California, do
they pay for airfare? It's just one of those

00:12:52.565 --> 00:12:57.803
really weird questions I've always wondered. The
second thing is, has there been a notable project

00:12:57.803 --> 00:13:01.611
that you've worked on where they called you, and
you didn't have to audition for it?

00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:09.406
LAURA: Yeah, both. I'll answer the first one. Yes,
they fly you for the most part. When I first moved

00:13:09.406 --> 00:13:14.254
out to California and I still had work at
Funimation in that first little bit, they didn't,

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:18.567
but it was understandable because I had shows that
I had been working on and all of a sudden I was

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:24.072
gone, so it was my responsibility to come back and
finish that recording. Now if there's a project

00:13:24.072 --> 00:13:30.982
that records in another city, then yeah, they'll
pay for travel. The second one, it's yes! I'm very

00:13:30.982 --> 00:13:37.153
grateful that there have been a couple projects
that they've come to me directly and asked if I

00:13:37.153 --> 00:13:49.422
would work on it. I'm trying to think if there's
any that are out that I can talk about... No? But

00:13:49.422 --> 00:14:00.524
there's a really cool one coming up that I would
love to tell you about. But I can't. Yes. You in

00:14:00.524 --> 00:14:08.504
the front, and then you in the second. I thought
those were roller skates for a second.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:09.782
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:10.914
LAURA: Hi!

00:14:10.914 --> 00:14:16.133
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I guess your role as Sana in
Child's Toy--

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:18.092
LAURA: Yeah! Kodocha, whoo!

00:14:18.092 --> 00:14:25.273
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was listening to that a lot and
wondering, when it gets so fast, how do you--

00:14:25.273 --> 00:14:31.523
LAURA: How do you breathe? You don't. You
basically don't breathe. No, I had so much sugar

00:14:31.523 --> 00:14:40.786
in my body when we were recording that show. So
much Red Bull. I would go in and it was, for the

00:14:40.786 --> 00:14:46.132
most part, Colleen, who was my roommate at the
time, was directing it. We would have these really

00:14:46.132 --> 00:14:51.763
long recording sessions where we would crack up
and make all these jokes and everything. But the

00:14:51.763 --> 00:14:58.672
hardest part was that because we were roommates,
she would hold me to a higher standard, and she

00:14:58.672 --> 00:15:07.935
would make me do those long paragraphs of
(fast-forward buzzing) and if I messed up towards

00:15:07.935 --> 00:15:15.253
the end, normally you can pick up and they'll
splice it together. But Colleen's like, "You can

00:15:15.253 --> 00:15:23.104
do it. Do it again." So I would have to do the
whole paragraph all over again. Yeah, it was

00:15:23.104 --> 00:15:31.183
craziness. Sometimes they would write it to where
they would say the first couple sentences of a

00:15:31.183 --> 00:15:37.934
rant and then literally put, "Sana keeps ranting,"
in parentheses. I was like, "Yeah, but I have to

00:15:37.934 --> 00:15:44.037
say stuff!" I'd have to make up random things to
start saying in the background so sometimes I was

00:15:44.037 --> 00:15:57.093
completely ad libbing. "Popcorn head," I think was
one of the ad libs. You can do it. Nobody breathe.

00:16:00.987 --> 00:16:02.363
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm now shorter.

00:16:02.363 --> 00:16:03.295
LAURA: I like your hat!

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:07.561
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! I like it, too. This
isn't really a question, because I don't seem to

00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:10.052
have questions, I just have statements most of the
time.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:11.292
LAURA: I'm prepared.

00:16:11.292 --> 00:16:16.493
AUDIENCE MEMBER: When it comes to talking to you
for some reason, I wanted to say that I enjoyed

00:16:16.493 --> 00:16:22.392
you yelling at me in Diablo 3 whenever I'm saying
I can't do that anymore. I can't do that yet. I

00:16:22.392 --> 00:16:26.988
have no-- Now I've forgotten what kind of
resource.

00:16:26.988 --> 00:16:28.156
LAURA: I have no more mana?

00:16:28.156 --> 00:16:31.483
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, it's either discipline or
vengeance.

00:16:31.483 --> 00:16:33.123
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

00:16:33.123 --> 00:16:38.483
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I played a demon hunter, so I'm
like, Laura and I have battled together.

00:16:38.483 --> 00:16:41.830
So we're besties now.

00:16:43.459 --> 00:16:48.834
LAURA: I'm not the demon hunter in the first part
of Diablo 3.

00:16:48.834 --> 00:16:50.034
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:16:50.034 --> 00:16:52.765
LAURA: Oh, really?

00:16:52.765 --> 00:16:53.952
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:16:53.952 --> 00:17:01.562
LAURA: You're doing it right, then. Yes. You look
beautiful.

00:17:01.858 --> 00:17:10.903
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! This is kind of
spoilerish for Critical Role.

00:17:10.903 --> 00:17:13.044
LAURA: Oh no!

00:17:13.044 --> 00:17:18.673
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Number one, how does it make you
feel to know that all the living de Rolos have

00:17:18.673 --> 00:17:23.063
killed a certain member of a certain evil family.

00:17:23.063 --> 00:17:26.013
LAURA: (evil laughter) It feels so good!

00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:30.182
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Then, did you ever think that Vex
would get to the point in her character

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:38.691
development and growth that she is now, where all
the things that upset her or she obsessed over at

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:42.759
the very beginning are just minor little
details--

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:44.884
LAURA: Isn't it so crazy?

00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:46.524
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's so cool!

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:56.114
LAURA: No, I never thought it would go there! We
had no concept of where the show would go or where

00:17:56.114 --> 00:18:02.581
our characters would go or where the story would
go. I know Matt, I'm sure, had this grand vision

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:11.923
in his head, but none of us realized it could ever
be what it is. When I created Vex, it was just

00:18:11.923 --> 00:18:17.673
this little-- this sounds like a fun thing to do.
Then the more we played, the more little quirks

00:18:17.673 --> 00:18:22.832
that they have keep coming out and then the
backstory that you made up makes sense with these

00:18:22.832 --> 00:18:31.515
random quirks. To be able to grow with that
character has been so freaking insane. Anytime I

00:18:31.515 --> 00:18:42.422
think about it, I'm blown away. It's so freaking
awesome, and it's so much fun to get to have that

00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:48.864
kind of experience with your best friends, and
then to get to share that experience with this

00:18:48.864 --> 00:18:56.926
amazing community of people that share that
experience with us. It's so phenomenal and I could

00:18:56.926 --> 00:19:06.377
never have grasped that it would go there. It's so
great. Yes. You are raising your hand and looking around.

00:19:12.263 --> 00:19:15.194
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First off, actually, you all can
hear me, right?

00:19:15.194 --> 00:19:16.392
LAURA: Do it!

00:19:16.392 --> 00:19:22.262
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a real loud voice. God
blessed me with good lungs. First off, I'd like to

00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:28.156
say that you're one of my favorite voice actors. I
have a male and female one, the male one is Jim Cummings.

00:19:28.156 --> 00:19:34.808
LAURA: That's a very good choice. I don't deserve
to stand next to him, but thank you.

00:19:34.808 --> 00:19:36.273
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, you voiced Jaina
Proudmoore.

00:19:36.273 --> 00:19:37.944
LAURA: Yeah!

00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:45.513
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Big World of Warcraft player. I
have a generic question for you. Also, just to

00:19:45.513 --> 00:19:50.393
make everyone glare daggers at me, I've never
heard of Critical Role before.

00:19:50.393 --> 00:19:58.557
LAURA: It's okay, because now you can explore it
and experience it.

00:19:58.557 --> 00:20:02.413
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Most generic question ever:
what's your favorite character of the video games

00:20:02.413 --> 00:20:04.461
that you've voiced?

00:20:04.461 --> 00:20:06.810
LAURA: Whoa, that's really hard.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.552
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have another one, if you want.

00:20:10.552 --> 00:20:14.644
LAURA: Okay, give me that one, too. Hit me. Don't
really hit me.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:20.372
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's it like working with
Blizzard with the voice acting?

00:20:20.372 --> 00:20:24.819
LAURA: Blizzard is amazing. Working with them is
always freaking so much fun, because they are so

00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:36.104
invested in the story. Whenever you go in for the
sessions, they'll spend the first 15, 20 minutes

00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:40.902
of the session letting you know-- because we've
been with these characters for so long-- where in

00:20:40.902 --> 00:20:48.013
the story it is, the mindspace that Jaina's in in
that place, where she's just come from. We'll get

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:54.880
to have this awesome discussion about the exact
mindset of who she's thinking about as she's

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.110
delivering these lines.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.875
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Kalecgos?

00:20:58.875 --> 00:21:07.524
LAURA: They're so giving in that respect.
They're always coming up with new, fun things,

00:21:07.877 --> 00:21:15.074
like Jaina in World of Warcraft, and I also get to
be Jaina in Heroes of the Storm and Jaina in

00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:20.212
Hearthstone and Jaina in all these other projects
that they always pull little aspects of her

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:24.677
personality for the different franchises. I think
that's a really fun thing because then it doesn't

00:21:24.677 --> 00:21:32.595
feel so like doing the same character for so long.
I forget even what your first question was.

00:21:32.595 --> 00:21:36.436
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It was what was your favorite
voice for a video game.

00:21:36.436 --> 00:21:41.459
LAURA: For anything. Yeah, I can't answer that,
because now I just want to say Jaina, but I feel

00:21:41.459 --> 00:21:44.960
like that's a little biased at this particular
moment.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.347
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fair enough. All right, that's
all I need to know, so.

00:21:49.347 --> 00:21:54.975
LAURA: Jaina! It's Jaina! There you go. Yes.

00:21:59.894 --> 00:22:03.625
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi!

00:22:03.735 --> 00:22:05.460
LAURA: Oh, hello!

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:12.750
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've found that you were voicing
a show called Ever After High at one point, which

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:18.199
I love. I would watch it when I was sick. I know
it might be for children, but I used to be a

00:22:18.199 --> 00:22:25.545
nanny. I love it. As Travis has played in Sophia
the First and you played in Ever After High and

00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:31.681
things for a younger audience, are there roles
that you really love playing or roles that you

00:22:31.681 --> 00:22:37.490
would never play again? Do you worry about being
typecast? Do you like playing diverse roles? How

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.690
do you decide what roles to take on?

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:47.790
LAURA: I audition, usually, and if they cast me,
then I'm like, "Yes." There are some projects that

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:54.721
now I can say I'm not going to audition for that.
It's usually things that are a little more

00:22:54.721 --> 00:22:59.976
questionable material, things that I don't agree
with, maybe. Whereas in the past I might not have

00:22:59.976 --> 00:23:06.070
had the opportunity to say no to something. I'm
grateful that I can do that now, because so much

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:18.380
of being an actor is just skating by and trying to
get your next job. I enjoy playing villains, but

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:25.201
they usually die or get defeated and then they're
not in the story anymore. Being a villain is

00:23:25.201 --> 00:23:33.909
always fun because you get to be a punk. I also
really like when my character has a romantic

00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:41.121
interest, and even if they don't, I'll ship them
with one of the other characters in the show and

00:23:41.121 --> 00:23:48.982
hope beyond hope that it happens. When I got cast
as Black Widow and Hawkeye was in the show, too, I

00:23:48.982 --> 00:23:55.423
was like, "Come on, you guys. Make it happen."
We'll be recording something and it won't even be

00:23:55.423 --> 00:24:00.300
that flirty, but then I'll see the animation and
they're fighting or something, I'm like, "Yeah!"

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:06.442
It looks flirty and it reminds me of the X-Men
series from when I was a kid and I was like,

00:24:06.442 --> 00:24:12.879
"Yeah, Rogue and Gambit!" You know what I mean? I
guess that says what my preference is. I want my

00:24:12.879 --> 00:24:18.684
character to have romantic interest. Yes, you.

00:24:25.837 --> 00:24:30.136
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Two quick questions. One, does
Travis know they put your panel in a room that's

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:33.400
five times the size of his?

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.029
LAURA: I don't think they should have, because
there was a bunch of other panels

00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:40.001
going on during this panel!

00:24:40.001 --> 00:24:42.629
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You've got to tell him this is
all the way full to the back with people.

00:24:42.629 --> 00:24:48.361
LAURA: Oh, man. I will. I already texted him
because when I got here the room was empty and I

00:24:48.361 --> 00:24:53.879
didn't know that there was a line or anything. So
I texted Travis, and I was like, "My room doesn't

00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:57.970
"have anybody in it," and he wrote back, "Ha ha
ha."

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.607
(laughter)

00:25:02.607 --> 00:25:03.831
LAURA: Oh, man.

00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:07.433
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And the other question is, what's
the most difficult voice for you to actually do?

00:25:07.433 --> 00:25:08.803
What type of voice?

00:25:08.803 --> 00:25:13.199
LAURA: The most difficult type of voice is
little-boy voices. Specifically like Trunks or--

00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:16.902
the worst one was Omochao, if you guys know who
that is--

00:25:16.902 --> 00:25:18.477
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, he's from Sonic.

00:25:18.477 --> 00:25:20.778
LAURA: He's in the Sonic games.

00:25:20.778 --> 00:25:22.171
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do it!

00:25:22.171 --> 00:25:30.684
LAURA: (as Omochao) So his voice is right here, I
think. I can't remember exactly. (normal voice) So

00:25:30.684 --> 00:25:35.957
it's raspy, but it's high, which is just the
stupidest thing, and it was one of those

00:25:35.957 --> 00:25:40.341
situations, if you guys saw the video game panel
yesterday, Ali mentioned auditioning with a

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:47.110
character voice that you can't necessarily
maintain. And that was totally what happened. I

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:52.338
auditioned for that role, and for the 30 seconds
of the audition it was totally fine, and then I

00:25:52.338 --> 00:25:58.421
got cast and I was 15 minutes into the session,
and I'm like, "I'm going to die. I can't do this.

00:25:58.421 --> 00:26:05.281
"I can't--" And Jack Fletcher was my voice
director, and he is this amazing director that not

00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:11.482
only does voice acting, but he does theatrical
work, so he's very much into your body posture and

00:26:11.482 --> 00:26:16.660
everything, so he totally gave me free voice
lessons, basically, when I was doing that job,

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.961
where he would teach me how to stand and how to
hold my head so that I could actually freaking

00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:27.275
sustain. And it totally worked, and he was a
genius. But it is very difficult, and it's always

00:26:27.275 --> 00:26:33.220
super painful. Trunks is hard because it's that
kind of a voice on top of battle reactions. (as

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.426
Trunks) So, like, Trunks is right here, which
isn't that bad because I've gotten used to doing

00:26:36.426 --> 00:26:44.770
it, but over four hours of doing it, and then
he's, like, powering up-- (normal voice) Man. It's

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:50.729
fine for the first two hours, but then as soon as
I take a break, like for 15 minutes and then go

00:26:50.729 --> 00:26:55.399
back in the booth, it's just death. It's like your
voice has gotten warmed up and then you let it

00:26:55.399 --> 00:27:04.858
cool down and you get back in the booth and it's
like (sobbing). So. Yes. I'm going to drink some

00:27:04.858 --> 00:27:06.843
water, because I did those two voices.

00:27:06.843 --> 00:27:09.164
(laughter)

00:27:09.164 --> 00:27:10.423
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're forgiven.

00:27:10.423 --> 00:27:11.491
LAURA: Thanks.

00:27:12.493 --> 00:27:21.281
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I asked this at Travis's panel
yesterday, but. Is there any pet peeves that he

00:27:21.281 --> 00:27:24.609
does that you get annoyed with?

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.401
LAURA: What did he say?! Did he just--

00:27:26.401 --> 00:27:27.960
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He said dice.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:34.859
LAURA: Oh, well, yeah, you know. Anything he does
that I'm annoyed with? Like, in life?

00:27:34.859 --> 00:27:41.924
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nothing too bad, but you know how
some couples bicker, right, but not in serious fights.

00:27:41.924 --> 00:27:51.292
LAURA: Right. Yeah, I'm sure, I'm just trying to
think. I have a noise thing. I feel like this

00:27:51.292 --> 00:27:58.142
would annoy him more than it annoys me, but I have
a noise thing, so if we're eating, I can't stand

00:27:58.142 --> 00:28:05.640
the sound of people eating. Ugh, it just drives me
crazy. So anytime we eat, if there's silence, I'm

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.650
like, "Turn the TV on!"

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:08.886
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, I'm like that too.

00:28:08.886 --> 00:28:14.181
LAURA: So that is one of the things. But that's
not really a pet peeve of mine that he has,

00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:16.009
because everybody eats.

00:28:16.009 --> 00:28:18.421
(laughter)

00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:26.364
LAURA: I don't know. He'll sit in the couch.
Instead of sitting on one of the seat cushions, he

00:28:26.364 --> 00:28:28.128
sits in the middle of the two seat cushions.

00:28:28.128 --> 00:28:30.984
(laughter)

00:28:30.984 --> 00:28:34.790
LAURA: That's a thing. And then I'm like, "Now
both of the seat cushions are squished, and I

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:42.020
"can't fix it because they're squished towards the
middle." So that's all. We have a pretty happy

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:47.525
life. We don't fight that much. Yes.

00:28:55.201 --> 00:29:00.390
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you for coming, first of
all. I'm currently on episode 64 of Critical Role,

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.563
so I only have about 200 hours.

00:29:02.563 --> 00:29:06.849
LAURA: Yeah, not much. So close.

00:29:06.849 --> 00:29:13.140
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I did want to ask, because I know
in total it's some obscene number of hours. What

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:19.918
is it like being able to tell a continuing story
over that much time?

00:29:19.918 --> 00:29:24.792
LAURA: It's so crazy. It's so crazy that we've
actually been so consistent with it, you know,

00:29:24.792 --> 00:29:31.928
when Matt's-- Oh, you don't know! Matt's back hurt
a couple weeks ago, and he actually, it was the

00:29:31.928 --> 00:29:37.111
first time in all of the episodes where he texted
all of us, he's like, "Y'all, I don't think I can

00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:43.281
"do this." And we actually had to cancel the show
that day. And it was the first time it had

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:49.212
happened in, what, how many years are we in? Like
two and a half years now? So that's so crazy.

00:29:49.212 --> 00:30:01.355
Yeah, I am happy that we've been able to do it,
and just in disbelief about it. Thank you.

00:30:01.355 --> 00:30:09.542
There's so much coming up, you just wait. So much
goodness. Yes.

00:30:12.263 --> 00:30:13.912
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello.

00:30:14.155 --> 00:30:15.923
LAURA: Hi. You're so cute!

00:30:15.923 --> 00:30:20.456
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, thank you. I have-- this was
similar to someone else's question, but I know

00:30:20.456 --> 00:30:25.884
that you had more of an actor/theatrical
background, and so when you went into voiceover,

00:30:25.884 --> 00:30:31.353
did you know that you would end up more in the
video game sort of cartoon area, or did you go

00:30:31.353 --> 00:30:36.561
into voiceover being okay with doing audio books
or that sort of thing?

00:30:36.561 --> 00:30:41.360
LAURA: I didn't really have an idea of where voice
acting would take me. In fact, when I started

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:51.631
voice acting, I was still in Dallas, and my focus
was still film and TV. It wasn't until I moved out

00:30:51.631 --> 00:31:00.462
to California and I realized how much voice acting
variation there is. Because in Texas, there was

00:31:00.462 --> 00:31:10.891
Funimation and there was AVD in Houston. Is that
still around? No? But there was AVD in Houston.

00:31:10.891 --> 00:31:17.066
It's like, if I wanted to drive that far, I could
work there. But there wasn't a lot of video games

00:31:17.066 --> 00:31:24.981
there. Gearbox wasn't really a thing when I was
there. So anime was all I could do, and anime is

00:31:24.981 --> 00:31:31.923
awesome, but it was like, go to Funimation every
day, and it's an office building, and you get to

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:38.221
feel like it's an office job, because it's the
same people and you walk in and it's like-- So it

00:31:38.221 --> 00:31:46.901
felt very much like not the same as doing TV or
something, where you go in and it's this whole big

00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:52.504
crew and everything's crazy. So that's totally
what I thought I wanted to do, because I'm like,

00:31:52.504 --> 00:31:58.561
"This is acting," because I was stupid. And yeah,
when I went out to California, it was like, "Oh,

00:31:58.561 --> 00:32:04.691
"there's these cartoons and these cartoons and this
anime and this anime and that studio does these

00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:08.981
"video games and this studio," and it's like all
over town, and every day, you go to a different

00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:17.323
place. And it made me realize what voice acting
could be outside of one studio. Because working at

00:32:17.323 --> 00:32:21.534
one studio, they get to know these particular
voices that you do, and that's what you keep

00:32:21.534 --> 00:32:25.989
getting cast as. And then out there, it was like,
"Oh, there's still all these people that don't

00:32:25.989 --> 00:32:33.385
"have any idea what I sound like and I can do
whatever!" I totally didn't answer your question.

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:40.771
I didn't ever realize what you could do in voice
acting, so I guess I just wandered into it without

00:32:40.771 --> 00:32:51.575
expectation. That's-- there you go. I suck, you
guys. I'm the worst answerer ever. Sorry.

00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:57.663
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I had one other question, if you
knew a lot about the track of voice directors. I

00:32:57.663 --> 00:33:01.785
know you mentioned a voice director you worked
with, and if they had more of a background in

00:33:01.785 --> 00:33:05.842
theater directing or they had done voices
themselves and now directed others?

00:33:05.842 --> 00:33:12.480
LAURA: Yes, both. A lot of them come to it from
working in theater, and a lot of them come to it

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:19.300
from, yeah, they were voice actors and now they're
directing other actors, because they know how to

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:24.553
communicate that way. I've been asked to voice
direct before, I voice directed at Funimation and

00:33:24.553 --> 00:33:28.490
since I've been out to California, I've had a
couple opportunities where they asked me to voice

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:35.753
direct. So that happens. And then there's other
people that they came up through the days of Hanna

00:33:35.753 --> 00:33:43.080
Barbera and got trained as voice directors, and
they are amazing at what they do, because that's

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.761
where their experience is and that's where their
education is, and there's a whole slew of

00:33:46.761 --> 00:33:48.522
directors that do it that way.

00:33:48.522 --> 00:33:49.730
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:58.733
LAURA: Thank you. Yes, in the back. You're Percy!
You look great!

00:33:58.733 --> 00:34:02.243
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. I guess I don't really
need the microphone.

00:34:02.243 --> 00:34:04.300
LAURA: You don't, but it's fine, right?

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:09.349
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I'm a big fan of Serana in
Skyrim.

00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:13.372
LAURA: Thanks. Best companion ever.

00:34:13.372 --> 00:34:16.691
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Seriously, I'm not even
exaggerating, she was the only companion I ever

00:34:16.691 --> 00:34:23.566
had through my, like, 20 playthroughs of that
game. And my question is, what was it like working

00:34:23.566 --> 00:34:31.389
at Bethesda, and also how did you enjoy playing a
sassy vampire who would not, under any

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:36.113
circumstances, stop complaining about the sun,
even if it was night?

00:34:36.113 --> 00:34:38.691
LAURA: No, really, she complained about the sun
when it was nighttime?

00:34:38.691 --> 00:34:40.509
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Every time I exited out a door.

00:34:40.509 --> 00:34:41.773
LAURA: Really?

00:34:41.773 --> 00:34:44.527
AUDIENCE MEMBER: "Ugh, it's just so bright
outside." It's 12 o'clock at night!

00:34:44.527 --> 00:34:46.752
(laughter)

00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:51.486
LAURA: I don't remember that part. She was my
companion, too. I never had any other companions

00:34:51.486 --> 00:34:52.452
except for myself.

00:34:52.452 --> 00:34:55.886
(laughter)

00:34:55.886 --> 00:35:00.481
LAURA: Everybody else annoyed me, because I was
always playing a really stealthy character and

00:35:00.481 --> 00:35:07.780
then they would just run into battle and give away
our location! It was the stupidest thing! It was

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:14.977
awesome playing her. It is awesome working for
Bethesda.

00:35:14.977 --> 00:35:17.117
(laughter)

00:35:17.117 --> 00:35:23.202
LAURA: No, I didn't– That was one of the projects
I don't think I knew what I was working on the

00:35:23.202 --> 00:35:30.128
first couple sessions I recorded, and then finally
after, "Okay, but what is it?" They finally told

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:36.763
me. No, it was awesome. I'm such a fan of that
franchise. Anytime I get to do a voice on a

00:35:36.763 --> 00:35:42.038
project that I'm a huge fan of I like it a little
bit more.

00:35:42.038 --> 00:35:43.343
(laughter)

00:35:43.343 --> 00:35:50.210
LAURA: Isn't that crap? I hope I don't do a better
job on those projects because I want to play them,

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:54.014
and so I'm like, "I've got to do a good job or
else I'm going to be annoyed with myself." It's

00:35:54.014 --> 00:36:00.714
possible. It was weird when I was playing it
because I would be crouching down, but then I

00:36:00.714 --> 00:36:02.660
would hear myself getting hurt.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.561
(laughter)

00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:06.057
LAURA: It was very confusing.

00:36:06.057 --> 00:36:07.759
(laughter)

00:36:07.759 --> 00:36:10.071
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:36:10.071 --> 00:36:12.674
LAURA: Thank you. Yes.

00:36:18.342 --> 00:36:20.278
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It scares me.

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:21.410
LAURA: Being on mic?

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.980
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, I'm behind the scenes for
community theater–

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.791
LAURA: Oh, awesome!

00:36:25.791 --> 00:36:31.622
AUDIENCE MEMBER: On Critical Role– I just want to
say thank you for being so gracious and kind to

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:38.283
opening your life and your world to us. It brings
so much joy and makes me feel grateful for

00:36:38.283 --> 00:36:45.331
watching you guys battle giant titans and
creatures that are way beyond anything a regular

00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:51.970
person could do. They can deal with that and
Scanlan's pooping in the corner.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.680
(laughter)

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.756
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you for being so gracious
in that. Then my actual question is: Travis is

00:37:00.756 --> 00:37:05.981
really into werewolves. <i>Really</i> into werewolves
and he expressed yesterday that if there's a

00:37:05.981 --> 00:37:12.611
werewolf campaign he wants that. If there's a
supernatural campaign for you, what creature, or

00:37:12.611 --> 00:37:19.031
urban myth type thing would you want to run, or be
in?

00:37:19.031 --> 00:37:28.238
LAURA: I mean, probably a modern-day witch
situation, because that's all off a book series

00:37:28.238 --> 00:37:35.771
that I love so much. (laughs) The Hollow series.
Have you guys read it? Oh my God, it's so good! It

00:37:35.771 --> 00:37:38.212
takes place in modern day, and it's about this
witch! Anyway.

00:37:38.212 --> 00:37:40.183
(laughter)

00:37:40.183 --> 00:37:45.399
LAURA: Yeah, so probably that. I was thinking– I
shouldn't tell you guys. No, it should be a

00:37:45.399 --> 00:37:51.530
surprise, but it's cool, so get ready for it
later.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.034
(laughter)

00:37:55.609 --> 00:38:02.324
LAURA: As for your comment, I just want to say
thank you guys for joining us on all of that,

00:38:02.324 --> 00:38:12.690
because I know that we're on the screen and
everything, and we're not actually sitting with

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:17.552
you guys playing, but it feels like we have a
whole bunch of friends playing with us that aren't

00:38:17.552 --> 00:38:27.004
there. After every game, I'll go on Twitter to see
what people are saying because I want to write

00:38:27.004 --> 00:38:34.303
back to people about the game, because it just
feels like everybody is there with us, you know?

00:38:34.303 --> 00:38:38.441
So thank you for that. Yes.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:52.740
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have two questions. One is
quick and one is more, you know. I came late so I

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.302
don't know if someone maybe asked this already.
What's probably the most rewarding thing about

00:38:57.302 --> 00:38:59.731
being a voice actor?

00:38:59.731 --> 00:39:07.380
LAURA: The most rewarding thing? Oh gosh, just
getting to be a part of the industry that I love.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:15.303
I grew up with video games and I would sit behind
my dad while he played Doom and Half Life and I

00:39:15.303 --> 00:39:21.662
always played the Sierra games growing up, all the
Quest for Glory games and Kingdom's Quest, and

00:39:21.662 --> 00:39:28.566
never realized it was something that I could be a
part of. Knowing what an impact it had on my life,

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:35.410
and then thinking that I could be a part of that
for somebody else. That feels really awesome.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:42.164
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Then my second question: What are
some of the differences when it comes to working

00:39:42.164 --> 00:39:49.046
when it comes to video games versus anime, or is
there anything that voice directors tell you that

00:39:49.046 --> 00:39:50.972
you need to do differently than the other?

00:39:50.972 --> 00:39:59.570
LAURA: No, it just depends on what the clients
want. I feel like the biggest differences-- with

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.929
anime and video games, it's actually pretty
similar, because you're in a room by yourself for

00:40:02.929 --> 00:40:11.202
the most part. With animation, series that record
out here will record in a room with a whole bunch

00:40:11.202 --> 00:40:15.741
of other people, so the cast actually records
together. That's something we can't do in anime or

00:40:15.741 --> 00:40:22.970
video games, usually, because of the nature of the
dialogue and the nature of matching picture. I

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:30.690
feel like it's all meshing together at this point.
Dragon Ball Z is a very specific style of

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:39.661
recording for sure, but Soul Eater is so cinematic
that recording, it's all very real and genuine--

00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:46.761
and so is video game recording now. Everything is
moving toward this cinematic, real version of

00:40:46.761 --> 00:40:55.990
everything and I think that's so awesome. I guess
the thing I do that is different than anything

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:01.053
else is motion capture, which is where a lot of
video games are going now. A lot of the time,

00:41:01.053 --> 00:41:07.121
instead of just recording in a booth, I'll
actually be on a stage in a really attractive

00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:18.134
spandex outfit going through the scenes real-time.
So that is turning into more of a theater thing.

00:41:18.134 --> 00:41:22.429
It feels like this mix between film and theater
because it's just a little elevated beyond what

00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:25.249
you can do for camera. So that's really fun.

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:29.389
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I play more video games than I
watch anime. My friends are all like, "Oh, you

00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:32.653
"should watch more anime." But I just play more
video games--

00:41:32.653 --> 00:41:33.892
LAURA: You should watch more anime!

00:41:33.892 --> 00:41:35.663
(laughter)

00:41:35.663 --> 00:41:37.291
LAURA: And everybody else should play more video
games.

00:41:37.291 --> 00:41:39.320
(laughter)

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:49.870
LAURA: And everybody should watch Critical Role!
Yes, you.

00:41:55.261 --> 00:41:59.513
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So we all know how much Matt
loves Vax and Vex and how their names are so

00:41:59.513 --> 00:42:04.250
similar. With your guys' new characters coming up,
have you gotten together and talked about pranking

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.021
Matt and making your names all very similar?

00:42:07.021 --> 00:42:13.190
LAURA: Oh god, he would just murder us. I honestly
think that he would be like, "No." He would say no.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.733
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Could you imagine him on screen,
though, have it completely different from what

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:17.461
they're going to be--

00:42:17.461 --> 00:42:24.430
LAURA: (laughs) He would kill us. That would just
be the worst. Honestly, when we were creating Vex

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:30.932
and Vax, we did not realize what a problem it
would be. It was Vax'ildan and Vex'ahlia... and

00:42:30.932 --> 00:42:38.682
then as we kept playing, it was Vex and Vax.
Sometimes I get it wrong. It's terrible.

00:42:38.682 --> 00:42:41.470
(laughter)

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:42.609
LAURA: Yes?

00:42:44.693 --> 00:42:49.362
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just wanted to say-- it's not
really so much of a question, it's just a thank

00:42:49.362 --> 00:42:57.803
you. Because this is my-- Percy's my son, and it's
watching Critical Role. Actually, it started with

00:42:57.803 --> 00:43:04.070
watching Fullmetal Alchemist, which I didn't even
know you guys voiced at the time! But it brought

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:10.188
us together. And gives us a lot of mother-and-son
time, and now we come to conventions like this--

00:43:10.188 --> 00:43:11.681
LAURA: Oh, that's awesome!

00:43:11.681 --> 00:43:17.952
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Anyway, thank you and the rest of
the cast of Critical Role. It's so much fun. It's

00:43:17.952 --> 00:43:24.931
kind of weird, because I caught up but I was
watching the back episodes--

00:43:24.931 --> 00:43:29.220
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: I started her at episode 90.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.140
LAURA: Oh really? How was that, starting at
episode 90? Is it weird?

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.448
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It was weird, but it was fine
because he brought me up to speed. But then I

00:43:36.448 --> 00:43:44.985
started watching from episode one on my own. So
now on that end I'm up to episode 59.

00:43:44.985 --> 00:43:51.516
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I'm so happy! Thank you so much
for sharing that. Thank you for being a part of it!

00:43:51.516 --> 00:43:54.449
(applause)

00:43:54.449 --> 00:43:59.968
LAURA: Seriously, it would be nothing if we didn't
have the community of people joining us for it. It

00:43:59.968 --> 00:44:04.219
really would still be us probably in mine and
Travis' house.

00:44:04.219 --> 00:44:05.698
(laughter)

00:44:05.698 --> 00:44:08.665
LAURA: We would have gotten ten episodes in like,
"Nobody's watching. Okay, well, we'll just go back

00:44:08.665 --> 00:44:13.379
"home, thanks!" Yes, are you Beetlejuice?

00:44:13.379 --> 00:44:14.183
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes.

00:44:14.183 --> 00:44:15.539
LAURA: Yes!

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:28.578
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm very new to playing D&amp;D and I
was wondering what your first session ever was like?

00:44:28.578 --> 00:44:41.139
LAURA: Our first ever session, we came in with our
names, our class, and our race, and that's it. I

00:44:41.139 --> 00:44:47.744
knew I wanted a pet, so I had a bear. Outside of
that, there was a little bit of texting back and

00:44:47.744 --> 00:44:51.514
forth about what we were going to be. Travis
didn't even have his dang name picked out when we

00:44:51.514 --> 00:44:57.384
played our first game. We sat down and he was like
"Uh. Uh." Because Matt was like, "Go around and

00:44:57.384 --> 00:44:58.512
"introduce yourself."

00:44:58.512 --> 00:44:59.785
(laughter)

00:44:59.785 --> 00:45:10.460
LAURA: He went, "I'm, uh, Grog." We're like,
"That's alcohol. Okay, that's fine." It was so

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:18.528
crazy. I think because I had played so many RPGs
on video games and stuff that I had this idea of

00:45:18.528 --> 00:45:24.769
what this world is going to be. So as soon as it
started we were all looking at each other like,

00:45:24.769 --> 00:45:31.729
"Whoa, what are you doing? What's going on?" Then
as soon as we started we had accents and stuff.

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:37.235
Ashley, when she first started playing with us,
she looked around because everybody was talking

00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:42.140
and she was like, "Oh no! Are we all doing
accents?" She's like, "I suck at a British accent,

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:49.775
"is that okay?" We were like, "Just do you, Pike,
just do you!" It was funny and crazy and zany and

00:45:49.775 --> 00:46:01.213
I think the very first game we had, we fought a
giant baby. It was a really gross fetus monster

00:46:01.213 --> 00:46:08.340
baby. I don't know. Matt brought it out as this
giant head thing. It's in the opening credits,

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:16.398
when we were telling our backstory of what we were
doing, and Wendy drew that gross baby thing. It

00:46:16.398 --> 00:46:24.880
was nasty. It was so much fun. We had intended it
to be one game for Liam's birthday, and then we

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:31.736
had a blast with it. A little time went by and
Liam was like, "So should we do that again?

00:46:31.736 --> 00:46:38.131
"Because that was really fun." Matt was running
another game at the time, so we were just hoping

00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:43.969
that he'd have time to run this other thing with
us, and it just kept going and going.

00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:48.202
Yeah, friends! Woo!

00:46:48.202 --> 00:46:49.937
(laughter)

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:57.840
LAURA: With the fake– yeah. How can you even– Are
you Pepsi?

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.141
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, I'm Pepsi man.

00:46:59.141 --> 00:47:01.175
(laughter)

00:47:01.175 --> 00:47:06.571
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm really impressed by all the
ranges you can do from Rise from Persona 4 who has

00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:10.694
a cutesy teenage girl voice to screaming Trunks.
So I'm just wondering, how long did

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:13.094
it take you to practice that?

00:47:13.094 --> 00:47:21.739
LAURA: I think it all came together over the years
of doing voices and stuff. I, oh gosh, I've been

00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:32.744
voice acting now for 18 years. Jeez! Which now
makes sense why people come up and say, I watched

00:47:32.744 --> 00:47:36.002
you in my childhood, because it's been that long.

00:47:36.002 --> 00:47:38.162
(laughter)

00:47:38.162 --> 00:47:46.163
LAURA: Dang, that's crazy! No, the first audition
I ever did was for Trunks, so I had never thought

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:51.888
about what voice acting would be, or how I would
come up with voices or whatever, but I saw the

00:47:51.888 --> 00:47:56.735
picture of Trunks and I was like, "What do all the
boys sound like in cartoons?" and so that is the

00:47:56.735 --> 00:48:03.076
voice that ended up coming out of my face, which I
don't know why that's the one I decided on. So

00:48:03.076 --> 00:48:08.029
that was the first thing I did, and I think having
that be my first voice, which was so far from my

00:48:08.029 --> 00:48:13.992
normal range, it left that door open for exploring
all the other ranges. I think if my first voice

00:48:13.992 --> 00:48:21.491
that I had done had been similar to my own, then I
may not have done all the voices that I do now.

00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:29.028
And plus, I studied singing and everything. I
studied musical theater, and anytime you're

00:48:29.028 --> 00:48:35.669
practicing increasing your range like that, you
can bring that into voice acting as well, because

00:48:35.669 --> 00:48:41.069
it's always useful to be able to do Lust to Rise.

00:48:41.069 --> 00:48:42.968
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:48:42.968 --> 00:48:45.119
LAURA: I'm sure you would make an amazing Rise.

00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:46.518
(laughter)

00:48:46.518 --> 00:48:48.288
LAURA: Because, man, yeah! Yes.

00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:58.189
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:48:58.189 --> 00:48:59.331
LAURA: Oh, hello!

00:48:59.331 --> 00:49:00.796
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can I get a high five?

00:49:00.796 --> 00:49:09.872
LAURA: Psh! Get up here! Okay, has anyone played
Lost Legacy? Uncharted: Lost Legacy? Then you know

00:49:09.872 --> 00:49:11.398
how bad I am at high fives. Okay.

00:49:11.398 --> 00:49:13.238
(laughter)

00:49:13.238 --> 00:49:18.356
LAURA: Yes! Third high five! We have a history of
high fives. Yeah.

00:49:18.356 --> 00:49:22.842
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I do have a question. It's: I
have not watched Critical Role,

00:49:22.842 --> 00:49:24.831
but I'm a huge fan of Titansgrave.

00:49:24.831 --> 00:49:26.296
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:31.008
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! So what's the comparison?
Because Titansgrave was such a small group and

00:49:31.008 --> 00:49:38.498
such a short-term game and then Critical Role, my
understanding, is a long-ass campaign, with ten or

00:49:38.498 --> 00:49:40.699
20 people playing. So what's–

00:49:40.699 --> 00:49:43.669
(laughter)

00:49:43.669 --> 00:49:48.448
LAURA: No, okay, so Critical Role is, what are we,
seven people? Something like that. A party of

00:49:48.448 --> 00:49:55.039
seven people. A party of eight people? I don't
know.

00:49:55.039 --> 00:49:56.088
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Seven

00:49:56.088 --> 00:50:01.193
LAURA: Seven. Seven people. There you go. So it's
not that big of a group difference, but I think

00:50:01.193 --> 00:50:08.801
with Titansgrave, we could have kept going. We had
this short amount of time that we were filming,

00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:14.398
but all of us wanted to keep playing, and we were
begging for a second season so that we could see

00:50:14.398 --> 00:50:20.386
where those characters would go. Because I
freaking love Lemley. I am so bummed that I only

00:50:20.386 --> 00:50:24.148
got to play her for that short amount of time,
because I just want to keep being her.

00:50:24.148 --> 00:50:26.348
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I based my own D&amp;D character on
Lemley.

00:50:26.348 --> 00:50:29.568
LAURA: What'd you say?

00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:36.081
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That I based my own D&amp;D character
off of Lemley.

00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:38.747
LAURA: Did you really? Do you have a Dodgy
Lobotomy?

00:50:39.162 --> 00:50:44.449
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So my character is a hunter and
got mauled by a bear, so now she has a robotic arm--

00:50:44.449 --> 00:50:50.123
LAURA: Sick! That's so awesome! Man, when we were
creating those characters, it was like, "Okay,

00:50:50.123 --> 00:50:54.325
"these are your choices," and I was like, "I want
to be this, but I kind of want to be a robot, too.

00:50:54.325 --> 00:51:01.361
"Can I combine them?" And so I made her have this
cyborg arm that a blade retracts from, and I named

00:51:01.361 --> 00:51:10.598
the blade Dodgy Lobotomy. She's so cool! So with
Titansgrave, we filmed it over I think it was

00:51:10.598 --> 00:51:20.629
three or four days of just 12-hour days of playing
non-stop, and then they took all of that footage

00:51:20.629 --> 00:51:29.489
and edited it down to the series. So that's a big
difference, because any of our downtown where we

00:51:29.489 --> 00:51:35.227
were like, "Where should we go?" or "Do you guys
want to go shopping?", all of that got cut out, so

00:51:35.227 --> 00:51:41.389
it's nonstop fun RP and action and stuff like
that, whereas Critical Role, all of those really

00:51:41.389 --> 00:51:47.759
boring moments of, "I don't know what to do,"
that's still there. So you guys have to sit

00:51:47.759 --> 00:51:53.166
through that. I'm sorry. Anytime that's happening,
I'm like, "Oh my god, they must be switching the

00:51:53.166 --> 00:51:59.074
"station right now, they must hate us." But it's
one of those evils of just playing these kind of

00:51:59.074 --> 00:52:02.148
games, right? It's a necessary evil.

00:52:02.148 --> 00:52:03.656
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you very much.

00:52:03.656 --> 00:52:09.189
LAURA: Thank you. But it's not boring! I did a
really bad job selling it to you. You should watch it.

00:52:09.189 --> 00:52:11.927
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The only reason I don't watch it
is because I don't have time.

00:52:11.927 --> 00:52:17.700
LAURA: Okay, it is a time-consuming thing. We were
hoping-- can I say this?

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.100
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.359
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Whatever you say stays in this
room.

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:27.628
LAURA: Well, okay. We're kind of hoping to be able
to come up with something. I know we have the

00:52:27.628 --> 00:52:33.455
podcast now, so it's just audio, so if you have
long drives or something, you can listen to it on

00:52:33.455 --> 00:52:39.456
a podcast form, which is fine, so you can get
caught up. But we're hoping that there's some way

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:48.321
we can do episode recaps, maybe episode arc
recaps, so that people that are so far behind can

00:52:48.321 --> 00:52:56.426
get caught up with chunks instead of having to
watch 400 hours of show if they don't want to put

00:52:56.426 --> 00:53:10.755
in that time. So. Maybe someday, fingers crossed.
Yeah. Oh, am I-- I've got two minutes left. Hmm.

00:53:10.755 --> 00:53:13.521
Yeah, get up there.

00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:17.356
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So for Dragonball Z, when you
voiced Gotenks, was that two different voice

00:53:17.356 --> 00:53:19.224
actresses in the booth at the same time?

00:53:19.224 --> 00:53:21.119
LAURA: Yeah, no, we weren't together.

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:25.992
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, well, yeah. I was wondering
if the process was any different than a normal voice role.

00:53:25.992 --> 00:53:32.800
LAURA: Yeah, the process is actually-- so when we
fuze, we're the same person, and then we have to

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:39.017
have the same personality, but luckily for me,
Gotenks has more of a Trunks personality, so that

00:53:39.017 --> 00:53:45.647
means that I got to record first. For the most
part. And then Kara would come in, and she would

00:53:45.647 --> 00:53:53.187
match my reads, and she's have to listen to it
over and over again and then say it to the same

00:53:53.187 --> 00:53:59.458
timing, which feels totally weird, because
sometimes I'd have to go in after I moved away,

00:53:59.458 --> 00:54:04.133
and Kara would record before me, so then I'd have
to match her timing on everything. Which is not

00:54:04.133 --> 00:54:07.200
that bad, because it's like what I said in Saints
Row, it's like that same sort of thing where you

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.744
have to match the timing and kind of add your own
delivery to it, even though they're the same

00:54:10.744 --> 00:54:18.949
person, but the battle reactions are really
freaking hard when you're matching somebody else's

00:54:18.949 --> 00:54:27.923
timing. All the little (battle reactions). Hmm.
Have to do exactly that. It's hard.

00:54:27.923 --> 00:54:30.231
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So she basically had to copy you
for all of that?

00:54:30.231 --> 00:54:32.868
LAURA: For the most part, ha ha ha.

00:54:32.868 --> 00:54:34.921
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:40.549
LAURA: Thank you. Oh man. Does that mean one more
question and then I'm done? One more question. One

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:50.758
more. Make it good. You. It better be so good.
(laughs)

00:54:51.915 --> 00:54:55.954
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So since you are such a big fan
of actually playing video games and RPGs and

00:54:55.954 --> 00:55:02.877
things like that, are there any video game
franchises or even anime or cartoon franchises

00:55:02.877 --> 00:55:09.346
that you haven't been cast in that you really
would love to work on, and if so, what character

00:55:09.346 --> 00:55:11.812
would you like to play?

00:55:11.812 --> 00:55:17.885
LAURA: Oh, jeez. Most of the franchises that I'm a
huge fan of, I've been in, even if it's been a

00:55:17.885 --> 00:55:24.487
small part. But I would love to-- and I've said it
so many times, I'm sure Bioware's like, "Shut up,

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:30.920
"Laura, we heard you." But I love Bioware so much,
and I would love to be an actual companion

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:37.159
character in one of those games, because then I
could romance myself.

00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:39.158
(laughter)

00:55:39.158 --> 00:55:45.646
LAURA: I mean, I guess I kind of am-- oh, shit.
Yeah, Kira. That is Bioware. Dang. I did it.

00:55:45.646 --> 00:55:47.245
I did it, guys, I made it!

00:55:47.245 --> 00:55:50.446
(cheering)

00:55:50.446 --> 00:55:57.686
LAURA: Thanks for joining me! I think we have an
autograph signing right after this, and then we're

00:55:57.686 --> 00:55:59.781
heading to the airport, so.

00:55:59.781 --> 00:56:01.316
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's got the work visas!
