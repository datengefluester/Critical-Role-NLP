1
00:00:00,317 --> 00:00:04,687
MATT: Hello, everyone! And welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role One-Shots, where we have

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:10,132
taken over the slot of "No Survivors" this Monday
thanks to the illustrious generosity of the

3
00:00:10,132 --> 00:00:12,026
fantastic Ivan Van Norman.

4
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:17,219
IVAN: Any day, you may take the slot whenever you
wish, especially when I get to be a player.

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,470
MATT: I like it when Ivan tells me it's okay for
me to "take his slot." The way he says it. But

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:29,044
yeah, so this evening we have the fantastic
pleasure of running a one-shot game of Pathfinder,

7
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:33,072
which, for those of you who haven't played,
Pathfinder is a fantastic fantasy RPG, it's

8
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:38,478
actually what we played for the first two years of
Critical Role. And tonight we get to show a fun

9
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:44,496
story that we've put together for this series of
players here, as well as show off the really cool

10
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:48,330
software Syrinscape, which I mentioned a few times
in the show, I use it to organize a lot of the

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,410
music and sound cues for Critical Role, we get to
show you some more of what it's capable of tonight

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,650
outside of my custom settings, this is what the
actual setup itself can do, which is phenomenal.

13
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:03,001
So, super excited to back that. Before we get
started, let me go ahead and introduce our

14
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:08,613
fantastic players for this evening. We have on the
table to my left, we have Ivan, who you've already

15
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:12,633
seen thus far, Ivan Van Norman, hello. Thank you
for joining us.

16
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:15,384
IVAN: I am happy to be here. Thank you for having
me.

17
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:18,398
MATT: Yay! We have Marisha Ray from Critical
Role.

18
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:19,818
MARISHA: Hi, guys!

19
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:24,159
MATT: And to the other table, we have Taliesin
Jaffe from Critical Role.

20
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,390
TALIESIN: Hi!

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,752
MATT: And our very two special guests joining us
this evening, Ashly Burch--

22
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:30,828
ASHLY: Hello!

23
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:33,328
MATT: And Phil Lamarr!

24
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:42,625
PHIL: (deep voice) Why, hi there! I'm going to use
this voice all night! For no good reason. A goblin

25
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,295
with a large set of testicles.

26
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:45,909
(laughter)

27
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:48,742
MATT: Which, to let you guys know, tonight's game
is going to be interesting because unlike a lot of

28
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:54,804
other fantasy RPGs, tonight the whole party is
goblins. Everyone are playing goblins, we'll go

29
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:59,572
ahead and do some quick introductions as to who
you're playing, starting clockwise back from how

30
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:01,867
we were introduced. So, Phil, who are you playing
as?

31
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:14,371
PHIL: I'm playing as Browntooth the rogue. Goblin
rogue. Sort of redundant. But it's a very large

32
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:16,206
word that I learned. Redundant.

33
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:19,473
IVAN: And someone clearly cast Bull's Strength on
those testicles.

34
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:24,524
MATT: Ashly, who are you playing?

35
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:26,803
ASHLY: I'm Piglet the barbarian.

36
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:32,812
MATT: Delightful. Taliesin?

37
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,750
TALIESIN: I'm Mezek the monk.

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,003
MATT: Aw, this is going to be fun. Marisha.

39
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:43,480
MARISHA: I'm Snizzler, the mad bombing alchemist!

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,258
MATT: Oh, man. I'm already excited. And Ivan.

41
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:55,412
IVAN: Grizznak Stompstork, reporting for duty.
Goblin fartmage, available to all of you. I am the

42
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,812
brains of the bunch, as you can see.

43
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:01,988
MATT: Perfect! This will be a fun adventure for
the evening.

44
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:06,024
TALIESIN: You actually get to use the phrase,
"I've smelt it, now it's time that I dealt it."

45
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:09,291
IVAN: Stolen, it will be used.

46
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,018
TALIESIN: Yeah, take it. Public domain, public
domain. I'm sorry if I already stepped on that one.

47
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:15,827
MATT: So we've got to go through a couple quick
announcements here and then we'll overview the game

48
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:21,657
stuff. So for those watching, I want to remind you
that this Thursday is Critical Role's 50th

49
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:27,075
episode. We're having a special episode to
commemorate this, a couple of surprises that we

50
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:31,818
have in store for you guys, so definitely be there
at Thursday at 7:00pm Pacific to check out our

51
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:35,879
50th episode. Marisha, you have a new episode of
Signal Boost tomorrow--

52
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:44,381
MARISHA: Yes! Episode two of Hector! Which is
episode six of Signal Boost! Watch it.

53
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:49,152
MATT: And having already seen it, this episode has
my favorite intro so far. I laughed for five solid

54
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:51,477
minutes straight, so you'll enjoy it.

55
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:54,857
MARISHA: It's very funny. Check it out, it's very
funny. Hector's funny.

56
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:56,000
IVAN: Hector's the best.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,381
MATT: Indeed. So part of this whole event tonight,
with the folks at Pathfinder, Paizo, and

58
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:05,208
Syrinscape, is in celebration of the upcoming
International Tabletop Day!

59
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,639
(cheering)

60
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,853
MATT: It is happening on April 30th, we'll be
doing a whole series of great events here in the

61
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:13,584
studio throughout the day so mark it on your
calendars, get your friends together--

62
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:16,852
IVAN: 24 hours of livestreaming.

63
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:18,960
MATT: Yes! It's going to be great. It's going to
be great.

64
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,327
ASHLY: For charity, right? For a good cause?

65
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:27,939
IVAN: KaBOOM! kaboom.org, which is bringing play
back into the lives of children currently living

66
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:30,791
in property, (scoffs) "in property." In poverty!

67
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,178
MATT: Children who have been bricked into walls!
It's horrible!

68
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:41,301
PHIL: They're stuck on estates! With nothing but
ponies. They need to play!

69
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:45,138
IVAN: They're living amongst property, land is
surrounding them. No, guys, so currently kids

70
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:49,042
living in poverty and they're trying to bring play
back into their lives, such as things like

71
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:54,696
board games, and we're actually going to be giving
away a lot of board games to kaboom.org, part of

72
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:58,700
your involvement during International Tabletop
Day, so don't miss it.

73
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,512
MATT: And if you'd like to plug what usually
occupies this spot on Mondays...?

74
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:08,689
IVAN: Oh, well, if you're a Critical Role fan, or
if you're any kind of fan, and normally you're

75
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:13,186
here Monday nights, then thank you for coming on
Monday night again. If you're not, and this a

76
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:17,532
weird timeslot for you, we still play role-playing
games on Monday nights, they are just

77
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:23,948
mini-campaigns instead of the epic, long
brainchild of Matt Mercer's amazing imagination,

78
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:29,283
instead we do little one-offs, like we just got
done playing "Army of Darkness" which was then

79
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:37,258
created by chat, it was coined "The Arby's of
Darkness," because their last stand was in the

80
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:41,164
middle of an Arby's restaurant which one of the
characters managed. And officially--

81
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,256
MARISHA: That's amazing

82
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,396
IVAN: It was pretty cool.

83
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:45,719
TALIESIN: What meat is this? What meat is this?!

84
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:50,500
IVAN: The deadites actually came out through the
portal at the very end of it, and they were all

85
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,520
the busboys, and the, "I'll swallow your soul,
I'll swallow your soul!"

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,762
TALIESIN: That's every Arby's I've ever been to.

87
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:57,340
PHIL: Really, it's the same thing.

88
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,175
IVAN: And the next campaign that we're going to be
doing officially/unofficially, is going to be

89
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:08,048
"Pugmire," which is a new game, it's basically 5th
edition in a world of fantasy dogs. It's

90
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,411
a post-apocalyptic future--

91
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,372
MARISHA: I was going to make a joke about that,
and then it was the real thing, so--

92
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,194
IVAN: It exists. It's in the future, in which all
man has been wiped out and now dogs reign supreme,

93
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:20,797
and they have formed a church called, "The Church
of Man," in which they have a code of laws, the

94
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:27,169
first law being, "Be a good dog." The second law
being, "Fetch what has been left behind," and the

95
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:32,549
third being, I believe it's, "Bite only those who
attack you." So it's great--

96
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,138
ASHLY: I'm imagining Mad Max with dogs, in my mind
now.

97
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:37,217
IVAN: But it's fantasy, it's still fantasy.

98
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:46,764
IVAN: So you could be like, a pincer cleric, or
you could be a dachshund rogue or something like that.

99
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:47,953
MATT: That's fantastic.

100
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:50,558
IVAN: So 7:00-10:00pm usually on Mondays, come
hang out.

101
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:57,255
MATT: Do it. Check it out, guys. It's pretty
fantastic. So, another cool thing about having

102
00:06:57,255 --> 00:07:03,061
Paizo, the folks from Pathfinder here, is we have
a bunch of giveaways to give out throughout the

103
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:05,148
evening to all you guys in chat.

104
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:09,968
MARISHA: Like, there's a bag of stuff. I don't
even know what it is. It's exciting.

105
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,378
TALIESIN: I think that's edamame.

106
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:18,855
MATT: First off, you guys can go to
paizo.com/goblins, and store.syrinscape.com/geek

But throughout the evening we'll be giving away

110

Adventure" pdf, the soundset from Syrinscape that
accompanies the "Burnt Offerings Adventure," and

111
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:44,698
one grand prize winner tonight will get a whole

114
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:56,282
So, big old grand prize for one of you guys out
there, so make sure you're engaging.

115
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:57,406
IVAN: Yeah.

116
00:07:57,406 --> 00:07:59,208
MATT: Anyway. Now that that's over with--

117
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,115
PHIL: Woo!

118
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:02,795
(laughter)

119
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:06,995
MATT: For tonight's game, you guys will be playing
goblins, of course. I'll go over the story here in

120
00:08:07,146 --> 00:08:11,564
a moment, but things to consider: part of
tonight's fun is, at certain points during the

121
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:18,510
story, if you roll really crappily on a roll, or
you want to get that extra action in, you're doing

122
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,867
good and you want to get that extra attack or
extra ability, each of you have constructed and

123
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:29,361
have at your disposal a goblin song that is custom
to your character. You may choose to sing this

124
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:34,752
song out loud on the stream and doing so will gain
use of that reroll or that extra action. Use it

125
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:38,858
sparingly, it's only once in a while, possibly a
once-a-night type circumstance. But I'm exci--

126
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:42,563
(burps) pardon, I'm excited to hear all of your
individual songs as we progress.

127
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,935
MARISHA: So excited, it gave him indigestion.

128
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:52,487
MATT: It's how it's the reaction, I get nervous,
guys. Great. So, that being the case, let's go

129
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:55,112
ahead and get this show on the road.

130
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:56,556
MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm so excited.

131
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:58,075
IVAN: There we go. Goblin pants!

132
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:02,837
MARISHA: Also, I'm using Liam's dice box because
he's not here, and he can't stop it.

133
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:04,638
(laughter)

134
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:07,320
IVAN: Liam, I'm touching your stuff, I'm touching
your stuff.

135
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,254
MARISHA: I'm going to rub my butt on it.

136
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:21,327
MATT: Here in the Sandpoint Hinterlands, nestled
in the western side of the Devil's Platter

137
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:27,445
Mountain Range, there lies the Bird-Cruncher Tribe
of rather rambunctious goblins known for their

138
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:31,607
deft trapping skills, having earned their name and
the majority of their food supply by snaring wild

139
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:38,769
birds and eating them raw. You five have grown up
together here among the caves and cliffs over the

140
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,538
past six years, outliving many of your other
brethren, making you tough. Although most of you

141
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:49,987
were the runts, discarded as weak and useless, you
were all taken in and raised within your cages,

142
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:54,548
which is how most goblins are raised, by the
sagely Guffeye.

143
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:55,752
IVAN: Guffeye.

144
00:09:55,752 --> 00:10:01,405
MATT: An ancient goblin oracle of nearly 30
years of age, who enjoyed the idea of having her

145
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:10,821
own troop of personal guardians, she shouts that
she is touched by the sight of Zogmugot, Lady

146
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:16,451
Last-Breath and the goblin hero-god of flotsam and
scavenging, though many of her visions have led to

147
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:23,157
grave misfortune and her favor within the tribe has
waned. But you guys believe her! Mostly.

148
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:29,406
IVAN: Zogmugot looks favorably upon our lovely
Guffeye.

149
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:37,205
MATT: This cold, overcast autumn morning rolls in,
and the five of you are returning from a morning

150
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:47,569
snare run, when you hear the sound of crackling
shouts from old Guffeye's crag porch. "Come! Come!

151
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:50,879
"The dream! The sight! Come!"

152
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,412
And she darts back into her little cave
hole.

153
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:57,668
IVAN: Guffeye has another dream! You know what
that means!

154
00:10:57,668 --> 00:11:00,366
PHIL: Someone's going to lose a hand.

155
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:04,620
MARISHA: Usually this means she's been drinking, I
just want to point that out.

156
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,367
IVAN: Well, let's go see what the old windbag's up
to, because you know it's going to involve us

157
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,457
probably dying.

158
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:12,845
PHIL: Probably.

159
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:14,242
MARISHA: Let's go!

160
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:20,618
MATT: Entering her home, the familiar smell of
pungent spices and rotting wood hits your nose,

161
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:27,746
and this hoarder hole of a home is crammed to the
brim with driftwood, molded leather, metal scraps,

162
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:32,682
torn hides, broken pottery, all sorts of other
beautiful pieces of junk.

163
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:33,880
IVAN: It's amazing.

164
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,261
MATT: Nostalgia comes over you as you glance at
the empty iron cages you once grew up in, now

165
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:46,043
partially buried and filled with wet wool. As you
guys enter, old Guffeye steps onto a small box and

166
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:55,407
turns, her snow-blind eyes clouded and bulging
above her toothy grin: "My runts! The Lady gifts

167
00:11:55,407 --> 00:12:07,619
"Guffeye. The wait is broken! I have a vision once
more. A thing, a great thing was shown to Guffeye,

168
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:23,215
"in both these eyes: a stone of crack and thoom! A
rock that barks like the storm! This rock, this

169
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:36,304
"stone, Guffeye must have! This Guffeye must get!
You! You must get this stone, bring it to me, for

170
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:39,854
"the Lady's blessing."

171
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:43,250
ASHLY: Guffeye, if I give it to you first will you
like me the best?

172
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,110
MATT: "I already like you the best--"

173
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,990
ASHLY: Yes!

174
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,007
MATT: "--but I will like you twice best."

175
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,660
ASHLY: Oh my God.

176
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,755
IVAN: Guffeye, as your esteemed and most
intellectual advisor, I have to ask: where did the

177
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:01,070
Lady bestow this vision upon you that we may find
the barking rock?

178
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:08,682
MATT: "Well, I awoke this morning, envisioning
just how much more I like Piglet than the rest of you--"

179
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:12,409
IVAN: But I just got done scrubbing all of your
sores last night!

180
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:13,597
MATT: "Silence!"

181
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,254
ASHLY: Sorry, Guffeye.

182
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:22,207
MATT: "Upon brewing my morning thatch tea, the
vision struck my face! I dropped it, it shattered,

183
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:31,829
"in a beautiful clattering of broken pottery, and I
saw before me a reminder that today is a special

184
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:43,413
"day. The sun. The sun rise highest in the sky!
Today is the day of the human festival in

185
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:56,518
"Sandpoint-- filthy, stupid human festival! The
Lady showed me a man. A man in blue, blue

186
00:13:56,518 --> 00:14:03,440
"everywhere, in robes, a church man." (spits)

187
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,663
(spitting)

188
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:13,899
MATT: "His name was Zaan-- Hold on."

189
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:16,052
ALL: Zaan?

190
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:19,667
MATT: "Zaan-- Zantos."

191
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,614
ALL: Zantos!

192
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:35,956
MATT: "Guffeye saw the people around the churchman
at this festival-- the churchman has the storm

193
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,981
"rock on him!"

194
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,681
IVAN: Ooh, storm rock.

195
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:53,835
MATT: "So. Go to this Sandpoint. Go to this human
festival. Find this blue-skinned, blue-robed

196
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:57,790
"church-man and take the stone for Guffeye, yes?"

197
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,939
ASHLY: That sounds pretty easy, like nothing bad
will happen?

198
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:04,884
IVAN: Easy! Exactly! We got this!

199
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:12,152
MATT: "The Lady also showed me: other goblins
know."

200
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,099
MARISHA: What?!

201
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:21,128
MATT: "Stupid, stupid Seven-Tooth tribe also wants
stone, going to city now!"

202
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,096
IVAN: Why would the Lady show them the blue
stone?

203
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:26,215
TALIESIN: Four tooth too many, that's--

204
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:29,227
IVAN: Seven tooth too much, two tooth is best
tooth!

205
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,757
MARISHA: I agree, I agree.

206
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:32,118
IVAN: Two tooth is best tooth.

207
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:41,178
MATT: "You go. Sneak in! Find churchman! Take
storm rock before Seven-Tooth dumb-dumbs! Bring

208
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:46,239
"back to Guffeye, get blessing-- and good meal,
promise."

209
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,874
PHIL: Oh, well, if there's food--

210
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,389
TALIESIN: And drink.

211
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:57,156
MARISHA: Yeah! Only with a good meal and a drink!
You got it?

212
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,455
MATT: "This I can provide."

213
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,708
ASHLY: And dessert?

214
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,906
MARISHA: Yeah!

215
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:04,656
MATT: "Piglet, you're now second most favorite."

216
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:07,965
ASHLY: (wailing) No! I didn't mean it! I don't
want dessert!

217
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:11,164
PHIL: Greed diminishes you.

218
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:13,116
ASHLY: (crying)

219
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:15,517
MATT: "Bring me stone, become first favorite!"

220
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,867
ASHLY: Okay, okay.

221
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:19,708
MATT: "Now go! Time is wasting!"

222
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:27,578
IVAN: (singing) Blue stone, blue stone, we will
get it all! Blue stone, blue stone, then we'll eat

223
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:33,905
them all! Stupid Seven-tooth is going to burn and
burn and die! Burn them all, burn burn, burn and

224
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,575
burn and die. Yay!

225
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:41,705
MATT: (laughs) As you guys exit the cavern, you go
to your various hidey-holes, gather all your

226
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:47,796
materials, your weaponry, whatever things you
think you may require on this journey. You know

227
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:52,637
that the direction is northwest, past the
Ravenroost mountain pass, towards this town of

228
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:58,642
Sandpoint, and that is where your path lies. The
clouds begin to gather overhead at this point in time.

229
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,577
IVAN: Ooh. Best weather for scavenging!

230
00:17:00,577 --> 00:17:03,074
PHIL: Nice and clammy.

231
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:06,523
IVAN: They won't even see us coming! Because we're
goblins.

232
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:10,793
MATT: A gentle rain slowly begins to hit down from
the sky above.

233
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:20,333
IVAN: How long is it going to take for us to get
to Sandpoint?

234
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:26,232
MATT: Depends on who's the best leader to find
their way there. I guess--

235
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,907
IVAN: Grizznak is best leader!

236
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:29,183
ASHLY: I am best leader!

237
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:30,437
IVAN: Grizznak is smarter!

238
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:32,147
PHIL: Which way do your feet point?

239
00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:34,668
MARISHA: Whoever said you were the smartest?

240
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:41,663
IVAN: Because I am the wizard, and the wizard is
always the smartest! This is simple goblin logic!

241
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:44,542
MARISHA: That is pretty good logic. I agree with
that.

242
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:48,693
ASHLY: But I have a big hammer!

243
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,497
IVAN: But you are-- look--

244
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:52,701
TALIESIN: She does have a big hammer, she has a
very fair point.

245
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:59,250
IVAN: Guffeye already tells you that you are the
most elite of Guffeye. So we don't want to soil

246
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:08,054
poor Piglet into having you out at front, best to
let Snizzler and Grizznak lead the way.

247
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,552
TALIESIN: You're the most complete, you heard him,
that's absolutely true.

248
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:13,212
MARISHA: I agree with that, yeah. You don't want
to tarnish your beautiful, shining reputation.

249
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:15,903
ASHLY: You're right. She would be so sad if I
died.

250
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:20,053
TALIESIN: Tarnish the, tarnish the handle of the--
yeah, it's--

251
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:23,694
ASHLY: Yeah, that's true. She wouldn't care if you
guys died, but if I died she'd probably be sad.

252
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:25,013
MARISHA: Exactly, exactly!

253
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:28,659
PHIL: Besides, whoever is in front is most likely
to be shot in the face with something.

254
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:32,311
MARISHA: Right, so, naturally, we're better to
lead. Am I right, Grizz?

255
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,301
IVAN: Yeah, you got it Snizzler. Grizz'n'Snizz,
all the way!

256
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:36,527
MARISHA: Grizz'n'Snizz!

257
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:41,028
IVAN: So I'm assuming I'm going to make some
navigation--

258
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:45,728
MATT: I would like for you to make a survival
check, as the leader of his group.

259
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:47,400
IVAN: Haha, yes, leader!

260
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,507
MARISHA: Grizz or Snizz?

261
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:51,600
MATT: Well, whoever one is leading.

262
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,653
MARISHA: Well, he's leading.

263
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:58,619
IVAN: I'm clearly the most intelligent goblin in
this troupe.

264
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,695
MARISHA: Oh boy, you're so smart.

265
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:04,004
ASHLY: Do I smell mutiny already?

266
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:06,309
PHIL: I think I smell lunch.

267
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:11,896
IVAN: But I think, I don't know if I want to burn
my song already.

268
00:19:11,896 --> 00:19:21,631
MARISHA: Look, Grizz, look. I'm really good at
building things, so naturally I know how to

269
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:22,962
survive better.

270
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,728
IVAN: You did make the best lean-to.

271
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:27,449
MARISHA: I did, I did, in the Boy Scouts.

272
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:31,450
IVAN: We went to juvie together.

273
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,883
MARISHA: We did. Good times. Can I try?

274
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:42,022
MATT: Well, we'll say you let (laughs) you let him
lead for a while.

275
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,199
MARISHA: All right.

276
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,673
MATT: As you start heading northwest, as you begin
to pass the south part of the Ravenroost mountain

277
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:56,158
pass, you're led into a relatively thick patch of
very, very painful bramble thicket chunk.

278
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,322
IVAN: Underbrush is the best!

279
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,412
ASHLY: I'm beginning to regret rescinding my offer
to be the leader!

280
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:06,246
IVAN: Everyone knows-- goblins know that the most
painful path is usually the right path!

281
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:11,363
MATT: And the most painful path does manage to
deal two points of damage to all of you as across

282
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:14,986
your flesh being dragged through the bramble
thicket.

283
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:18,449
MARSIHA: That's only your own self-loathing,
Grizz, Jesus! Ow!

284
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,053
ASHLY: I could use a writing utensil.

285
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,334
IVAN: Oh, that hurts.

286
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:26,928
MATT: Until eventually Snizzler decides to rise up
in frustration and take over the leader position.

287
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:30,149
MARISHA: Jeez, all right, come on. Let me see.

288
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:33,731
IVAN: Here, take dick bone, that is the leader
staff.

289
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:38,824
MARISHA: All right, thank you. We got it from an
old badger.

290
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:41,442
MATT: Go ahead and make your survival check.

291
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,123
IVAN: I swear this is best.

292
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:48,176
ASHLY: Oh no. That's not a good reaction.

293
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:49,284
MATT: So?

294
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:51,206
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one.

295
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:56,743
TALIESIN: And they were never seen or heard from
again. Game over!

296
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:58,253
MATT: Well done!

297
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:01,742
IVAN: We're running the best goblin scenario ever
right now.

298
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:04,845
MARISHA: Are they going to make it out of the
brush?

299
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:07,324
TALIESIN: Like brownies and willow, man, we're
done for.

300
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:14,698
MATT: Wading deeper and deeper into the bramble
thicket, now under the guidance of Snizzler.

301
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:17,207
MARISHA: Look, it's just about finding the flow.

302
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:20,976
PHIL: The flow is up my buttocks!

303
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:24,645
MATT: You all take an additional one point of
piercing damage as you're

304
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:26,772
scratching your way through.

305
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:31,320
IVAN: It hurt! Guys, guys, I don't know, but I
think I have one more rash that I didn't have

306
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,306
previously somewhere.

307
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:36,335
MARISHA: Oh, jeez, there's poison oak everywhere!

308
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:42,028
MATT: The rain intensifies, starting to echo
through the mountain ranges in the distance, the

309
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:48,201
storm appears to be getting relatively stronger.
However, during this travel the rain that is

310
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:52,935
washing down the side of the mountain does lead
you to a position of the thicket that isn't quite

311
00:21:52,935 --> 00:21:56,271
so heavy, and eventually you guys make your way
outside of the immediate

312
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,136
physical danger of the terrain.

313
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:01,338
PHIL: Congratulations.

314
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:03,939
TALIESIN: There's got to be some cover around
here.

315
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,927
MARISHA: I think we're further than we started.

316
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:09,892
IVAN: See, at least we're not at the cave
anymore.

317
00:22:09,892 --> 00:22:14,344
ASHLY: Piglet doesn't like lightning. Can we go
somewhere where there's no lightning?

318
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:15,576
MARISHA: Okay.

319
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:22,284
IVAN: Well, are we close to a tree? Because trees
are really good to have cover under lightning, I'm told.

320
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:26,416
ASHLY: I wasn't sure whether or not you were the
smartest, but that's the best logic I've heard all day.

321
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,284
MARISHA: I agree! I agree! You kill it every time,
Grizz!

322
00:22:29,284 --> 00:22:33,250
IVAN: That's why I'm the wizard! (singing) That's
why they call me the greatest!

323
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,049
MARISHA: You always did read the most.

324
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,162
PHIL: You call you the greatest. No one else calls
you that!

325
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:38,839
IVAN: Well, Grizznak is the greatest.

326
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:42,010
MATT: At which point, a large bolt of lightning
hits a tree maybe about 20 feet off from

327
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:47,863
you, sending sparks flying, the tree bursts into
flames and tumbles onto the ground. I need--

328
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:50,843
MARISHA: Holy shit! Did you see that, dude?!

329
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:54,391
IVAN: Look! Look! Zarongel smiles upon us! See,
he's lit our way!

330
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:56,648
ASHLY: You said that lightning didn't like trees!

331
00:22:56,648 --> 00:23:00,318
MARISHA: That was rad, bro! Oh yeah!

332
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:02,276
ASHLY: I don't know about these guys...

333
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:09,241
IVAN: So, with no cover and nothing around it I
have a feeling maybe we should make a mad dash for

334
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:13,232
either caves or potentially Sandpoint. We're not
anywhere close to Sandpoint--

335
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:16,648
MATT: You've done a few loops in the area--

336
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:17,825
ASHLY: We've been looping?!

337
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:20,791
MATT: Did anybody else want to try and lead this
expedition?

338
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:25,392
TALIESIN: Did you want to go which way-- no, I
know which way! I'm going to go! And I'm going to

339
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:27,057
walk in a direction. Follow me!

340
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:28,678
MATT: All right, Mezek.

341
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:30,264
MARISHA: I love family outings.

342
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:33,558
TALIESIN: What am I rolling? I just rolled, what
do I add to it?

343
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:34,593
IVAN: Survival.

344
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:40,908
TALIESIN: Survival? Where is survival? 19!

345
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:42,089
MATT: All right.

346
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:42,908
ASHLY: Finally.

347
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:44,169
IVAN: Don't screw this up.

348
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:48,990
MATT: And with this, Mezek, for as far as goblin
franticness is concerned, manages to medicate

349
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:56,651
himself with various alcohols to a state of
concentration, pushes forward deeper into the

350
00:23:56,651 --> 00:24:00,794
forest, against your better judgement. But in
doing so, stays out from the rainfall, manages to

351
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:05,121
avoid a lot of the lightning storm which is now
blowing over the southern portion of the mountain

352
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:09,649
range and leads you guys, over the next couple
hours, through a bit of a muddy, sloshy forest

353
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:13,854
terrain towards the outskirts of the actual town.

354
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,928
IVAN: Is it still night, or is it still--

355
00:24:16,928 --> 00:24:21,958
MATT: Oh no, it's about mid-day now, it's
pushing-- you're pushing into, like, the early

356
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:25,522
afternoon at this point. You've lost a few hours
on your journey.

357
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:32,534
TALIESIN: There! I only take about two hours of
responsibility today, and I'm done! It's someone

358
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:34,201
else's problem now!

359
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:38,245
PHIL: I will lead, now that I can see where I'm
going!

360
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:41,617
IVAN: Hey, let's do the circle thing again! That
was fun!

361
00:24:41,617 --> 00:24:43,619
MARISHA: That was fun, like a game.

362
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,399
TALIESIN: Was that fun? Because I've experienced what
I thought was fun before, and it was nothing like that!

363
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,984
PHIL: Most of my fun does not hurt quite so much.

364
00:24:49,984 --> 00:24:52,079
IVAN: As they say, "No pain, no gain!"

365
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,834
PHIL: I don't like the ones who say that.

366
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,287
MATT: All right, guys--

367
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,412
IVAN: As they say, "No pain, no shame."

368
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:02,662
PHIL: I think they just like to rhyme.

369
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:08,986
MATT: Following Mezek's path, you eventually make
your way through the forest, alongside the

370
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:14,803
southern side of the Lost Coast Road, coming upon
the edge of the trees, to the Tyrandarock River.

371
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:21,393
It surrounds the town of Sandpoint itself and
encompasses it. It's a port town that's set on the

372
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:25,441
ocean, and this river surrounds the outskirts of
it. So you find the edge. You hit the muddy banks

373
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:29,478
of this river, and looking across you can see now
the actual city proper.

374
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:33,454
PHIL: Browntooth is very into city planning so
this is very interesting.

375
00:25:33,454 --> 00:25:35,506
(laughter)

376
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:38,415
IVAN: I'm into city burning. That's my favorite.

377
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:41,049
MARISHA: Especially if they're human cities.

378
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:42,293
PHIL: Yes!

379
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:48,805
IVAN: Burning, burning. So, I think because my
survival ability is so amazing, I'd like to

380
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:55,789
propose that I try to fashion some sort of
flotsam, with Zarongel's guidance, I would like to

381
00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:02,378
try to take some flotsam and make some type of
floaty-pushy thing, that we might wade the wiver--

382
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:03,561
wade the river.

383
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,817
ASHLY: "Wade the wiver"?

384
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:11,038
IVAN: Wade the wiver! To get across to the city.
Not even bothering to look for a bridge.

385
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,038
MATT: Sure.

386
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,288
MARISHA: You know we don't use no dirty human-made
contraptions.

387
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:19,948
ASHLY: Wait, wait, wait, why don't we just swim?!

388
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:29,682
MARISHA: No, no, no, look: the Snizz can do a lot
of things. The Snizz does not swim. Not very

389
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,288
confident in my swimming abilities.

390
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,135
PHIL: I'm not sure the Snizz can do a lot of things!

391
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:34,615
(thunder)

392
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:37,538
IVAN: Oh, Zarongel smiles on us again, yay.

393
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:39,682
MATT: As you guys glance from the flash--

394
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,818
IVAN: Smite another tree, Zarongel! Sorry.

395
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:45,949
MATT: It's okay. You see the bolt of lightning
strike a distant watchtower on the far side of the

396
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:49,243
city that has a rod specifically to pull these
types of things out of the way.

397
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:50,682
IVAN: Stupid idea.

398
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:54,542
MATT: Glancing over, I'll have you guys roll a
perception check if you could. Everybody go ahead

399
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:56,443
and roll perception.

400
00:26:56,443 --> 00:27:03,500
IVAN: Solid 17.

401
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,007
ASHLY: 17.

402
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:09,171
PHIL: Ten.

403
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:10,509
TALIESIN: Natural one!

404
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:11,861
MATT: Marisha?

405
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:13,118
MARISHA: Ten.

406
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:14,615
IVAN: 17.

407
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:19,637
MATT: All right, so we got two 17s here, from you guys.
Al right, so as you guys are glancing about, you

408
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:24,045
can see the city before you and it generally loses
most interest to all of you, especially Mezek,

409
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:27,774
who, while your direction sense has been great
today, once you get to the actual location of your

410
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:32,093
intent, you've lost all interest and you're
playing in the mud. The thick clay on the side of

411
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:34,050
the river smeared on your face.

412
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,397
IVAN: I want to kick any sculptures that he makes
out of mud.

413
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:37,656
MATT: Okay.

414
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,129
PHIL: Make sure it's mud!

415
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:43,006
IVAN: Whatcha going to do about it, Mezek, whatcha
going to do about it?

416
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:45,088
TALIESIN: Wait 'til you're asleep.

417
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:53,186
MATT: Now you're not sure if it was mud because it
spooked you a little. So, the two of you glance

418
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:57,717
over and you can see there are two bridges that
lead to the city itself that go over, but both of

419
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:01,424
them look extremely heavily guarded. You have two
passes of three sets of guards that walk back and

420
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:08,573
forth, armed with crossbows. You guys do-- As the
midday rain is still pouring down and it's causing

421
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:13,175
the surface of the river to spatter, you can see
there's a little bit of what would have been a

422
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:16,469
morning marine fog that's been burning off
since it went out there so it's no longer really

423
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:23,719
at your disposal. However, you two do notice,
right across the river against the bank before it

424
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:30,878
rises up to the top of the city itself, you see,
barely visible, the outside of a metal grate. Some

425
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:37,969
sort of a subterranean sewer or tunnel system that
is sealed shut across the way. It's a good, say,

426
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:43,488
80 to 100 feet across that river right now and it
does have quite the current to it, probably

427
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,515
because the rain's been pouring for most of the
morning.

428
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,045
IVAN: Goblins plus sewers equals awesome.

429
00:28:48,045 --> 00:28:51,241
MATT: Smart one here, doing the math.

430
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:55,965
IVAN: Yes. So we have to wade the river in order
to get to the grate?

431
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:58,960
MATT: What do you want to do to get there? It's up
to you guys.

432
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,636
ASHLY: Do we have to go to the grate?

433
00:29:00,636 --> 00:29:01,811
MATT: You don't have to.

434
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:06,888
ASHLY: I don't like lightning, and I really want
to use my hammer. As a result. Those two things

435
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:08,696
are connected, don't question.

436
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:10,438
PHIL: Can you swim with your hammer?

437
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:12,401
ASHLY: I just want to smash the dudes guarding the
bridge.

438
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:16,811
PHIL: Are there guards on both bridges? Are there
guards on both bridges?

439
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,388
MATT: Yes.

440
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:27,266
IVAN: Look, I think, just putting it out there,
that grate is really, really good because there's

441
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,495
no people in there. And humans are dumb-dumbs.

442
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:35,112
ASHLY: Are you not goblins?! Do you not like
smashing humans' skulls?!

443
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:41,109
IVAN: I like, pewpewpew human's skulls. I don't
like to get in all up in the face thing, Piglet.

444
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:43,083
ASHLY: I think he's a coward!

445
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:53,045
IVAN: How dare you call Grizznak the Great a
coward! And I want to-- I don't have magic mouth--

446
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:58,192
I want to Grease her. I want to cover her in
grease.

447
00:29:58,192 --> 00:30:00,245
PHIL: Who doesn't?

448
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,479
TALIESIN: This got weird quick. All right.

449
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:05,599
ASHLY: Do I roll to not get greased?

450
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,500
PHIL: We dive in the brambles and then begin to
grease each other.

451
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,681
MATT: It has started. The game has indeed
started.

452
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:18,257
IVAN: "I will show you true power!" As grease
spurts out from my hand.

453
00:30:18,257 --> 00:30:20,505
ASHLY: I will roll against grease.

454
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:26,421
MATT: Yes, for you, I need you to make a reflex
saving throw. So go ahead and roll a d20 and add

455
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:27,547
your reflex.

456
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:31,012
ASHLY: 19, I will have you know. Plus my reflex.

457
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:33,000
TALIESIN: There's a little box right there.

458
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,283
ASHLY: Oh, five.

459
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:35,558
MATT: You rolled a 19?

460
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:36,710
ASHLY: 19 plus five.

461
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,096
PHIL: Yeah, she rolled a 19.

462
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:42,919
MATT: You go and (raspberry noise) begin to spew
grease from the outside of your goblin staff--

463
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:50,325
Piglet, however, a little ball of anger and
muscular rage, instead darts out of the way,

464
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:54,605
slamming into the side of the sandbank that you
are currently playing in the mud and clay with,

465
00:30:54,605 --> 00:31:00,209
causing that to collapse partially onto you. You
are now partially buried under the clay. And what

466
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:03,190
little bit of your head is pointing out is now
being sprayed with grease.

467
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,254
TALIESIN: (sputters, coughs)

468
00:31:07,254 --> 00:31:19,773
IVAN: Oh, sorry. That was meant for Piglet. Okay.
High five! All is forgiven.

469
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:23,260
PHIL: I say we do the opposite of whatever he
wants to do.

470
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,349
ASHLY: So we're going to get the humans! We're
going to smash 'em with hammers and other sharp--

471
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:28,638
TALIESIN: We're supposed to be stealthy, can we do
it and be stealthy?

472
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,336
IVAN: I think stealth is better.

473
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,583
TALIESIN: Is there a way to smash humans with
stealth?

474
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:35,552
PHIL: How many guards are there?

475
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:39,556
MATT: Looking, there's about six to each bridge
that you can see.

476
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:44,165
ASHLY: Can I tell if it's more advantageous for
any reason to go through the bridge

477
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:46,158
versus the sewer?

478
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:47,419
IVAN: Combat.

479
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:56,054
MATT: It's hard to say. A town full of people--
make an intelligence check.

480
00:31:56,054 --> 00:31:57,809
Go ahead and roll a d20.

481
00:31:57,809 --> 00:31:59,637
ASHLY: This is not going to go well!

482
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:01,909
IVAN: Roll for comedy.

483
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:03,870
ASHLY: One!

484
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,990
MATT: Natural one. What?

485
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,390
ASHLY: Ten. Ten altogether.

486
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:19,325
MATT: Ten altogether? Okay. So you know humans.
You know them pretty well. And they're tall, but

487
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:24,750
they're pretty weak. There's a lot of them on
these bridges. That's a lot of really, really weak

488
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:33,413
things. Conversely, in the sewer, who knows what's
in there? There's filth, there's scavenging

489
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:42,348
pieces, and possibly dirty humans. So it's up to
you. Do you want to go out in a delightful goblin

490
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:47,700
blaze of glory? Or do you want to go out in a
delightfully messy goblin blaze of glory?

491
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,063
ASHLY: The disembodied voice makes a good point,
let's go in the sewer.

492
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:53,034
(laughter)

493
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:55,696
PHIL: Right! Let's drown rather than be stabbed!

494
00:32:55,696 --> 00:32:57,375
MARISHA: How are we going to cross?

495
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,595
IVAN: Drowning is the way Zarongel would want us
to go out.

496
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:02,369
PHIL: I thought you were going to build us some
flotsam-floaty-flotsam.

497
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:07,091
MARISHA: I'm really nervous about water. I like
burning things.

498
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:08,453
ASHLY: I can carry you, I'm strong.

499
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,131
TALIESIN: I want to look around and see if there's
anything to add to this flotsam pile.

500
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:12,667
MATT: Sure, make a survival check.

501
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:16,902
IVAN: Can Snizzler and Mezek help me to--

502
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:18,258
MARISHA: Build a rough raft.

503
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:19,403
IVAN: Yeah, to build a rough raft.

504
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:20,384
TALIESIN: Seven.

505
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,651
MARISHA: I roll as well.

506
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,510
IVAN: 17.

507
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,313
MARISHA. What am I adding here? Don't I have 
good stuff for tinkering?

508
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:32,038
IVAN: Do you want to tinker? I think this is
survival.

509
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:34,944
MARISHA: Oh, survival. Ten. But he rolled pretty
good.

510
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:40,351
MATT: Okay, it takes you guys the better part of
about 30 minutes or so as you find things in the

511
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,638
nearby edge of the woods. You start pulling up the
bits of clay and sand that you were buried under

512
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:47,951
as something caught your foot, and it was a bit
pointy but you found a chunk of driftwood that looks

513
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:52,825
to have made its way there. I would like you all
to make a stealth check, as you are now having to

514
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:55,869
dart in and out of the forest to find material.

515
00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:02,006
ASHLY: 18 plus 14.

516
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,630
PHIL: Three plus 20.

517
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,257
MATT: Plus 20?! Goblins! Oh my god.

518
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:11,212
TALIESIN: 36. Damn!

519
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:12,460
MARISHA: 32.

520
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,431
IVAN: 33.

521
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:18,511
MATT: Okay! You guys deftly, running back and
forth along the bank of river, grabbing

522
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:23,206
what you can out of the sand and the dirt,
apparently entirely unnoticed as there even is a

523
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:29,939
series of guards that come by, four of them, that
just walk on past. One of them you swear stared into

524
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:31,977
the forest right at you and went--

525
00:34:31,977 --> 00:34:35,010
MARISHA: Be garden gnomes you guys, garden
gnomes!

526
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:40,266
MATT: "Hey, Steven! Did you leave some gnomes out
here? Stupid gnomes."

527
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:42,346
And they keep on walking past.

528
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,363
MARISHA: Haha, garden gnome act gets 'em every
time! Heh, heh, heh.

529
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:53,400
MATT: "Wait, I want some garden gnomes!" And he
comes back in. "Nah, they look filthy. All green.

530
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,322
"From the mold. Stupid garden gnomes." And he keeps
going.

531
00:34:57,322 --> 00:35:02,027
IVAN: He's the first one that's going to get
pew-pewed.

532
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:04,668
MARISHA: I agree. Boom-boom! Heh.

533
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:06,282
IVAN: Boom-boom, pew-pew.

534
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:08,776
TALIESIN: Two arms, two legs, one head, we'll find
him at the end.

535
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:12,814
IVAN: I've got his face. I've got his beady face.

536
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:19,271
MATT: So you've crafted this "raft". It's less of
a raft and more of a pool noodle buoy thing.

537
00:35:19,271 --> 00:35:25,343
IVAN: Yes! Yes, let's all get on a pool noodle
which is basically a giant branch.

538
00:35:25,343 --> 00:35:30,380
PHIL: That's the first smart thing you've said all
day!

539
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:37,248
MATT: This is less like Tom Hanks in Castaway,
more Gollum in the river. You guys are having to

540
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:42,107
hold on and move across. However, as you push it
into the water, it is buoyant and it does seem to

541
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:47,558
carry you. The current does tend to push it, so
you guys are going to have to guide it across the

542
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:51,496
current. If I could have you all make a swim
check.

543
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:56,182
MARISHA: Oh, I'm so bad at this! I'm really not
the best swimmer, you guys.

544
00:35:56,182 --> 00:35:57,348
ASHLY: 11.

545
00:35:57,348 --> 00:36:01,223
MARISHA: Oh boy, this is so bad!

546
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:02,511
MATT: Five?

547
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:05,758
PHIL: 12.

548
00:36:05,758 --> 00:36:07,381
TALIESIN: 21.

549
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:17,184
MARISHA: Four. I have a fear of swimming.

550
00:36:17,184 --> 00:36:19,882
PHIL: Sorry, 17.

551
00:36:19,882 --> 00:36:26,617
MATT: 17, okay. So you guys are pushing along. The
three of you are back to back, feels like goblin

552
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,010
power, getting in there.

553
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,684
PHIL: Oh, I swallowed a fish! (cough)

554
00:36:30,684 --> 00:36:32,337
TALIESIN: Share! Share!

555
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:35,332
MATT: You glance over your shoulder and see the
two of them going, (yelling).

556
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:37,091
IVAN and MARISHA: (yelling)

557
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:39,774
MARISHA: I hate water!

558
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:43,012
PHIL: Our fearless leaders!

559
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:45,123
ASHLY: That feels perfectly appropriate.

560
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:48,788
MATT: As part of the screaming echoes out, you
hear someone in the distance go,

561
00:36:48,788 --> 00:36:50,242
"D'you hear that?"

562
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,236
ASHLY: Shut up! Shut up!

563
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:53,572
IVAN: (screams quietly)

564
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:56,131
MARISHA: (hyperventilates quietly)

565
00:36:56,131 --> 00:37:05,980
MATT: Okay. You guys stop moving and the current
carries you, and you slowly begin to rotate in the

566
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:12,009
water and you're being rained on in the face. And
you see a couple guards look as you drift under

567
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:18,015
the bridge on the far left side of where you
entered and they look down and go, "Man, they'll

568
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:25,679
"throw away anything these days. Perfectly good
piece of wood." As it drifts under the bridge, you

569
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,137
guys have a moment to go ahead and try and push to
shore. Go ahead and roll swim checks again.

570
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:32,527
MARISHA: I'm so afraid.

571
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:33,667
IVAN: Better.

572
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,468
TALIESIN: 16.

573
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:36,957
IVAN: 20.

574
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:38,458
MARISHA: Negative one.

575
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,161
MATT: Haha! It's okay.

576
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:41,634
PHIL: What, are you made of lead?!

577
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,973
MARISHA: I have a negative four swim, I just
want to point that out. (cries)

578
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:53,492
MATT: So as you're pushing there, you're making
headway, except for the fact that Snizzler is

579
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:57,153
going like, (yelling) and pushing your heads
under, trying to climb out of the water.

580
00:37:57,153 --> 00:38:00,141
IVAN: Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

581
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:05,012
ASHLY: I say we kill her. We cut our losses? What?
Am I right?

582
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:07,820
PHIL: Let's just knock her out, we'll need someone
to carry all of her stuff.

583
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,413
ASHLY: I can carry it! I'm strong!

584
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:13,012
MATT: As the splashing and chaos hits, you guys
(impact noise) hit the sandbank on the other side

585
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:15,740
of the river. You have managed to cross it
primarily.

586
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:22,947
MARISHA: Snizzler vomits. As soon as he hits land
(vomit noises).

587
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:26,393
TALIESIN: I want to go through the vomit to see if
there's anything interesting in there.

588
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:29,074
IVAN: I was going to say I'm-- I fight to get to
the vomit.

589
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,299
TALIESIN: Yeah we'll fight, we'll fight.

590
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:31,455
IVAN: We'll fight for the vomit.

591
00:38:31,455 --> 00:38:34,626
MATT: I want both of you guys to roll initiative
to see who gets to the vomit first.

592
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:35,619
IVAN: Fuck!

593
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:36,945
TALIESIN: What's-- oh. 11.

594
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:38,622
MATT: What did you get?

595
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:40,326
IVAN: I got 11!

596
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:42,665
MATT: You guys both--

597
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:44,421
PHIL: Conk!

598
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:48,855
TALIESIN: (cackling) (raspberry noise)

599
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:53,658
MATT: And with that, Mezek grabs a hand scoop up
of this crusted sand--

600
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:55,039
TALIESIN: I have a jug.

601
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,142
MATT: Puts it in the jug. Closes it off.

602
00:38:58,142 --> 00:38:59,921
TALIESIN: I'll go through it later.

603
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,630
IVAN: Being a goblin is amazing.

604
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:11,394
MATT: At which point you hear another voice say,
"Did you hear laughing? I'm going to go check."

605
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,434
And you hear a number of footsteps coming your
way.

606
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,441
IVAN: I'm going to cast Ghost Sound.

607
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,365
MATT: Okay.

608
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:18,840
IVAN: To see if I can distract them away.

609
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,474
MATT: What kind of sound are you producing?

610
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:25,948
IVAN: I'm going to produce a righteous
merriment-making sound.

611
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:29,293
MATT: On the direction of...?

612
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:31,863
IVAN: It sounds like drunken storytelling.

613
00:39:31,863 --> 00:39:38,780
MATT: Okay. So, at this point you guys watch as
Grizznak spins around, points his staff forward,

614
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:46,030
and quite a ways away you hear this boisterous
(indistinct drunk storytelling) start blasting

615
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:51,156
from the opposite side of the bridge, up near the
rocks that begin to meet the base of

616
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:56,116
the city's foundation. The footsteps shift and you
hear them going across the wood planks above you

617
00:39:56,116 --> 00:40:01,490
on the bridge, in the direction that he set. Now
is your time to go ahead and dart for the

618
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:06,488
grate on the outside of the sewer. Go ahead and roll
stealth checks, all you guys.

619
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,770
IVAN: Stealth checks?

620
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,221
TALIESIN: That's leaning.

621
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:10,943
ASHLY: 23.

622
00:40:10,943 --> 00:40:12,065
MATT: 23?

623
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:13,259
PHIL: 40.

624
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:17,691
MATT: Jesus! You vanish from time and space!

625
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:20,534
TALIESIN: He folds to be one-dimensional.

626
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:24,244
MATT: You have a fifth-dimensional goblin on your
team now.

627
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:25,510
TALIESIN: 31.

628
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,928
MARISHA: 19.

629
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:28,144
IVAN: 22.

630
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:31,194
MATT: Okay. You guys, darting through the rain,
using the edge of the rocky--

631
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:33,083
PHIL: What took you so long?

632
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:38,157
MATT: You get to the grate, and there is indeed
Browntooth sitting there picking his teeth with

633
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:39,544
one of his blades.

634
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:41,894
TALIESIN: How did he do that?

635
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:43,766
ASHLY: What I don't-- you were just-- and then--

636
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:47,347
PHIL: Sometimes it pays to be quiet.

637
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:51,516
ASHLY: I think we all learned a valuable lesson.

638
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,889
PHIL: Now who's going to rip off this grate?

639
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:55,815
ASHLY: Me!!

640
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:57,196
PHIL: Oh, god!

641
00:40:57,196 --> 00:41:00,127
MATT: Piglet, go ahead and make a strength check.
Roll and add your strength modifier.

642
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,796
ASHLY: (laughing) 25.

643
00:41:01,796 --> 00:41:09,460
MATT: 25! With one hand, Piglet, holding the hammer
in one hand, grabs the grate, spins it in place,

644
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:16,460
sending rust and metal sparks, and throws it
behind her, (sploosh).

645
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,247
ASHLY: And I go like this.

646
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:21,241
PHIL: Again, I would like to mention about the
being quiet part.

647
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:27,822
IVAN: I take a moment to absorb all of that
amazing that happened right there.

648
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:29,581
ASHLY: You're welcome, you're welcome.

649
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:36,632
IVAN: Yeah, Grizznak, not being the strongest of
the bunch, is easily swayed by intense feats of

650
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:38,022
strength. Oh, my!

651
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:40,962
PHIL: Grizznak, you look like you want to grease
her again in a whole new way!

652
00:41:40,962 --> 00:41:47,344
IVAN: Wishes he had another Grease spell prepared!
Woo! Okay.

653
00:41:47,344 --> 00:41:53,975
MATT: At which point you hear the howl of distant
wind and the droplets of condensation within the

654
00:41:53,975 --> 00:42:02,338
depths of this sewage system beckoning to you as
an entry portal to this city. Secretly, privately,

655
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:06,355
and hopefully to wherever this festival is
happening where you can gather this "Storm Rock."

656
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:08,446
IVAN: Smells just like home.

657
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:10,488
PHIL: Yes, moldy and clammy.

658
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:16,050
IVAN: Yay. Hey, do you remember when we were in
juvie and they threw us down in the "lock box"?

659
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,336
For like a month?

660
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:19,102
MARISHA: Oh, dude, and we got so blazed.

661
00:42:19,102 --> 00:42:20,262
IVAN: We got so blazed!

662
00:42:20,262 --> 00:42:21,562
MARISHA: That was so good, man.

663
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:23,096
IVAN: Yeah, this reminds me of that.

664
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:24,676
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, I agree.

665
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,255
ASHLY: I feel excluded.

666
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,878
(laughter)

667
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,725
ASHLY: Remember when I ripped the grate off of the
thing?

668
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:32,213
PHIL: Oh, those were the days.

669
00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:34,375
TALIESIN: When did that happen? I don't remember
that.

670
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,927
IVAN: I think we're all going to want to sneak--

671
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,281
PHIL: Let's go inside.

672
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:39,524
IVAN: Sneak around inside.

673
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:43,405
TALIESIN: I want to keep my eyes peeled for
things that might be useful or that can contain alcohol.

674
00:42:43,405 --> 00:42:49,902
MATT: Okay. Good to know. You guys step your way
inside the sewer. The slick stone structure of it

675
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:58,408
has lots of residue buildup from various minerals
that have come through, as well as various degrees

676
00:42:58,408 --> 00:43:04,839
of wastewater that have found their way to the
river. The smell is horrible for anyone but you

677
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:13,430
guys. It's a familiar scent. As you make your way
inside-- I'd say about 100 feet in as you're going

678
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,400
through the darkness here-- but you guys can see
fine in the dark, this is goblin speciality.

679
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,285
IVAN: Darkvision, guys.

680
00:43:20,285 --> 00:43:24,875
PHIL: I check to see if there are any insects that
are tasty-looking.

681
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:30,088
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

682
00:43:30,088 --> 00:43:32,525
PHIL: 21.

683
00:43:32,525 --> 00:43:44,234
MATT: All right. Glancing about, you do see a
cluster of some sort of an egg sac that is pushed

684
00:43:44,234 --> 00:43:52,804
up into the corner along the curved rotation of this
duct. It's roughly the size of a large melon. And

685
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:54,358
it twitches--

686
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:56,172
IVAN: I will burn it with Flare.

687
00:43:56,172 --> 00:43:57,192
MARISHA: Yeah!

688
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:58,583
ASHLY: Don't burn it, we're going to eat it!

689
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,627
MATT: As you're looking up at it, (fwoosh) it
bursts into flames.

690
00:44:01,627 --> 00:44:03,183
ASHLY: What the heck!!

691
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:06,355
PHIL: Who burns food?!

692
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:11,754
IVAN: Roasted spiders are best spiders. See, you
guys aren't smart, so you don't know that burning

693
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:14,246
spiders makes them that much tastier.

694
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:16,118
ASHLY: Are there spiders left to eat?

695
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:23,417
MATT: You go and glance and the slight tiny series
of squeaks you hear as the hundreds of tiny spider

696
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:31,384
young have burned to their end. There is a nice
waft of cooked scent that hits your nose. And the

697
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:39,577
rumbling in your tummy takes over, as you guys all
leap in at once, grabbing small chunks of what you can.

698
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:42,278
MARISHA: This is the best, when it's crispy on the
outside but gooey on the inside.

699
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:44,140
PHIL: I wish there was tartar sauce.

700
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,579
TALIESIN: "Oh wait!" I open up the jar--

701
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:48,251
(horrified laughter)

702
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:50,556
TALIESIN: Smear some on his spider chunk.

703
00:44:50,556 --> 00:44:52,083
PHIL: Close enough!

704
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:56,322
IVAN: Did you season our birds spider egglettes
with vomit?

705
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:59,854
ASHLY: Don't knock it. This is the good shit.

706
00:44:59,854 --> 00:45:01,487
IVAN: I burned it for you!

707
00:45:01,487 --> 00:45:03,207
TALIESIN: I won it fair and square!

708
00:45:03,207 --> 00:45:09,963
IVAN: I'm going to cast arcane mark on the side of
this wall and mark that we were here.

709
00:45:09,963 --> 00:45:17,433
Particularly, "Grizznak the Greatest was here," is
what I'm going to mark. But it really looks like a

710
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:19,680
giant butt with like a cloud--

711
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,478
TALIESIN: I was about to say, can you read and
write?

712
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:22,768
PHIL: No words?

713
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:29,357
IVAN: No, no words. The symbol for "Grizznak the
Greatest" is a goblin with two cheeky farts and a

714
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:30,608
cloud coming out of it.

715
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,532
TALIESIN: I was imagining a goblin dick-butt.

716
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:34,065
(laughter)

717
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,583
IVAN: That is the mark of Grizznak the Great.

718
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:40,676
PHIL: A goblin dick looks like a human dick, but
with spurs.

719
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:44,178
TALIESIN: Oh, god! Oh! Thank you, thank you.

720
00:45:44,178 --> 00:45:46,545
MATT: We learned a very valuable lesson this
evening.

721
00:45:46,545 --> 00:45:48,794
IVAN: Of goblin physiology.

722
00:45:48,794 --> 00:45:50,529
PHIL: That's how you know it's love.

723
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:52,244
TALIESIN: No!

724
00:45:52,244 --> 00:45:53,838
MATT: Tumblr, get on that.

725
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,317
TALIESIN: Oh, god. Too late. Moving on.

726
00:45:57,317 --> 00:46:00,493
PHIL: I can't unsee it in my mind!

727
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:04,091
TALIESIN: You won't have to, you'll go on the internet in
about an hour, and it'll be there. There's nothing

728
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:05,206
that can be done anymore.

729
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:06,950
MATT: You did this, Phil. You did this.

730
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,523
TALIESIN: We're not kidding. We're not even
kidding a little.

731
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:15,228
IVAN: Oh, all right. Grizznak the Great has left
his Arcane Mark. A goblin dick-butt.

732
00:46:15,228 --> 00:46:19,893
MATT: Progressing forward for the next couple
hundred feet into this slick sewer, making your

733
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:29,145
way along embankments where bits of clutter,
broken sticks, chunks of wayward stone and mortar

734
00:46:29,145 --> 00:46:37,622
pieces that have washed down here have built these
small half-walls of junk that have mucked up the side.

735
00:46:37,622 --> 00:46:44,426
MARISHA: Snizzler takes a firecracker that he has
and secretly lights it and throws it behind him

736
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,306
real fast without telling anybody.

737
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:55,557
MATT: Okay. You guys walk forward until
(explosion) you all glance over your shoulder real fast--

738
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:57,180
TALIESIN: I attack.

739
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,646
(laughter)

740
00:46:58,646 --> 00:47:00,925
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

741
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:02,072
TALIESIN: Thank you.

742
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:04,100
IVAN: "I attack the darkness!"

743
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,833
(laughter)

744
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,153
TALIESIN: 14.

745
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:13,178
MATT: 14, okay. You turn around real fast as a
piece of rock that is set loose from this small

746
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:19,019
firecracker explosion, whips through the air and
you punch it with your fist.

747
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:21,514
Go ahead and roll damage.

748
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:26,200
IVAN: I forgot he's a goblin monk. He punches
things.

749
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,179
TALIESIN: That's five.

750
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:38,405
MATT: With that, you turn this piece of mildewed,
slimy, sewage-encrusted stone to dust as it (poof)

751
00:47:38,405 --> 00:47:43,522
in front of you. Holding your fist as it shakes
there quivering, your eyes open. Any buzz you may

752
00:47:43,522 --> 00:47:49,589
have carried from your morning alcohol has waned
for now and you are far more awake and conscious--

753
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:51,299
with a mild headache.

754
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:57,441
IVAN: Guys, we're into this campaign and so far
the only thing we've defeated is a rock. This is

755
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,017
the best goblin campaign.

756
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:00,725
(laughter)

757
00:48:00,725 --> 00:48:05,438
MATT: The path does split here now and divides to
the right and left.

758
00:48:05,438 --> 00:48:07,652
ASHLY: Can I roll perception?

759
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:08,822
MATT: To see...?

760
00:48:08,822 --> 00:48:11,104
ASHLY: If there's anything different about them?

761
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:12,620
MATT: Sure, go for it.

762
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,730
ASHLY: 17 plus four is 21.

763
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:22,265
MATT: Piglet, you're the instinctual tracker. Most
goblins hunt with traps, you hunt with teeth.

764
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:23,503
ASHLY: Nice.

765
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:29,375
MATT: So you get down and (sniffing) begin getting
into the muck and pushing it aside. Less than a

766
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:34,555
visual perspective here, you can smell that the
bulk of the waste that comes through here comes

767
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:38,532
from the left path. That probably means more
waste, means more people.

768
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:41,276
IVAN: More waste, more people.

769
00:48:41,276 --> 00:48:43,064
PHIL: So we should go away from the people...

770
00:48:43,064 --> 00:48:48,866
ASHLY: Wait, what are we doing?

771
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:50,218
MARISHA: Yeah, why are we here?

772
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,917
IVAN: Get the blue stone.

773
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:53,047
ASHLY: A rock! The rock!

774
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:56,007
TALIESIN: The cracked man with the blue stone!

775
00:48:56,007 --> 00:49:00,846
ASHLY: Zachary! That's the guy, right?

776
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:03,705
PHIL: He's in blue. He's got a rock.

777
00:49:03,705 --> 00:49:10,749
IVAN: I remember he's in a birch. Like a birch
tree. Right? Birch.

778
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,267
TALIESIN: No, a church tree!

779
00:49:12,267 --> 00:49:14,090
IVAN: A church tree, that's right.

780
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:19,531
MARISHA: And we stay under trees when there's
lightning. That's what you're thinking of.

781
00:49:19,531 --> 00:49:23,386
IVAN: Right. That's right, because Zarongel likes
to smite trees.

782
00:49:23,386 --> 00:49:26,358
PHIL: Do we go to the poop, or away from the
poop?

783
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:29,623
ALL: To the poop!!

784
00:49:29,623 --> 00:49:32,159
IVAN: To the poop! So we go down the left channel.

785
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,096
MATT: All right, so you guys-- (laughs) you charge
forward here--

786
00:49:36,096 --> 00:49:39,230
ASHLY: Wait, just to clarify, because I used my
teeth, does that mean I ate

787
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:42,390
poop to find the tunnel?

788
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,246
PHIL: Well, I hope you saved some for the rest of
us!

789
00:49:45,246 --> 00:49:51,329
MATT: No, you had to smear it on your teeth a
little. Pushing forward, you guys travel another

790
00:49:51,329 --> 00:50:00,055
80 or so feet before you come onto a large series of
waterfalls that run into a central open cesspool

791
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:06,626
area that is down below this path. The actual path
diverts and goes around this central tunnel before

792
00:50:06,626 --> 00:50:10,678
it continues in a singular direction as the water
is pouring in.

793
00:50:10,678 --> 00:50:12,354
PHIL: What do we see above?

794
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:13,780
MATT: Make a perception check.

795
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,480
IVAN: Can I look as well?

796
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,506
PHIL: 25.

797
00:50:18,506 --> 00:50:21,400
IVAN: 12.

798
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,781
MATT: Okay. You look down into the cesspool and
hock a loogie to see how far it goes down.

799
00:50:26,781 --> 00:50:29,062
(splash noise)

800
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:30,265
IVAN: 25 feet.

801
00:50:30,265 --> 00:50:31,952
TALIESIN: Those are not supposed to be solid.

802
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:33,369
PHIL: And deep too. What? No.

803
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:38,142
MATT: You glance up and you can see there is some
sort of a large, heavy grating that most of the

804
00:50:38,142 --> 00:50:43,397
water is pouring down from. You're not quite--
looks like a lot of the rainwater runoff from the

805
00:50:43,397 --> 00:50:49,879
city itself. However, you do notice a glimmer from
what little bit of light that is bouncing through

806
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:54,063
from the surface and your goblin eyes catch this
little glimmer in the corner and you glance over

807
00:50:54,063 --> 00:50:56,725
and instinctually run towards it. You go ahead
and take a look.

808
00:50:56,725 --> 00:50:58,014
PHIL: It's shiny.

809
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:03,743
MATT: You find a
hefty well-made human shortsword.

810
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:06,726
PHIL: Dibs.

811
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:08,392
IVAN: So it's a broadsword for you.

812
00:51:08,392 --> 00:51:10,805
PHIL: Are you saying I'm small?

813
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:12,520
IVAN: I'm saying we're all small.

814
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,636
PHIL: Oh, right.

815
00:51:13,636 --> 00:51:16,896
MATT: What did you roll? What was the total on
your perception check again?

816
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:18,014
PHIL: 25.

817
00:51:18,014 --> 00:51:24,546
MATT: 25. You take this and the blade is 
perfectly clean. This place is filthy. This blade

818
00:51:24,546 --> 00:51:27,961
is perfectly clean, and as you glance over
underneath the waterfall you see another glimmer.

819
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:34,392
PHIL: Ooh! I run and go over there. I carry the
sword with me. I don't trust these two.

820
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,705
TALIESIN: I see that he is. I'm approaching
cautiously.

821
00:51:36,705 --> 00:51:39,819
ASHLY: I want to push everyone else away and get
there first.

822
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:42,885
PHIL: Hey wait, you can't even see it, can you?

823
00:51:42,885 --> 00:51:45,195
MATT: Both of you guys make initiative checks
right now.

824
00:51:45,195 --> 00:51:48,114
ASHLY: 11.

825
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:49,316
PHIL: Four.

826
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:50,785
TALIESIN: Wait, you got plus six.

827
00:51:50,785 --> 00:51:51,816
PHIL: Ten.

828
00:51:51,816 --> 00:51:53,978
ASHLY: Oh wait. 15.

829
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:58,204
MATT: So as you see this and you glance over out
of the corner of your eye, you see Piglet. Her

830
00:51:58,204 --> 00:52:04,087
eyes go wide and both of you have that immediate
knowledge of "me first". You both dart off around

831
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:10,441
two different sides of this cistern and starting
to get there. However, Piglet, you get there first

832
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:15,235
and immediately leap towards this shiny. And the
shiny is bigger than you expected.

833
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:19,785
IVAN: Can I cast Mage Hand to see if I can snatch
it from all three of them or

834
00:52:19,785 --> 00:52:21,463
away from the two of them?

835
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:23,272
MATT: Is it a five-pound maximum?

836
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:24,471
IVAN: Five pounds, yeah.

837
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:28,547
MATT: You go ahead and cast Mage Hand towards that
shiny and pull and (grunts) it's a little heavier

838
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:33,867
than you can pull. You get there and you grab on
to it. What you notice as you get there is a set,

839
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:41,399
a full set, of a breastplate armor. Human size,
giant breastplate with some shoulder pauldrons and

840
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:45,022
a human ribcage on the inside of this
breastplate.

841
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:46,534
ASHLY: Ooh! Ribcage.

842
00:52:46,534 --> 00:52:50,228
MATT: You smell it. Marrow hasn't been tapped
yet.

843
00:52:50,228 --> 00:52:52,947
ASHLY: Can I eat it?

844
00:52:52,947 --> 00:52:54,297
MATT: You can.

845
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:55,972
ASHLY: I eat it.

846
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:57,247
PHIL: Barbeque.

847
00:52:57,247 --> 00:52:58,814
ASHLY: Can I wear the armor? Is it too big for
me?

848
00:52:58,814 --> 00:53:01,559
MATT: It's pretty big, yeah. You could sleep in
it.

849
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,265
PHIL: Rent it out!

850
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:09,786
MATT: So you grab the ribcage, break off a couple
ribs, start gnawing on them, sucking the marrow

851
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:17,781
out. You do notice, getting there and inspecting,
the ribcage is white. It is clean as well. You can

852
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:23,396
see, upon close look as she is gnawing, not even
paying attention, you see these little teeth marks

853
00:53:23,396 --> 00:53:27,734
on it like rats have come through here and there.
Overall, the bone is perfectly clean. The armor

854
00:53:27,734 --> 00:53:31,500
itself is spotless, looks like it's been perfectly
polished.

855
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,049
ASHLY: This marrow's real good. You guys are
missing out.

856
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:39,143
MARISHA: Pass me a rib.

857
00:53:39,143 --> 00:53:46,522
PHIL: Is there any of the armor that any of us can
fit?

858
00:53:46,522 --> 00:53:52,063
MATT: You could try and pull scrap from it if you
wanted to try and scavenge pieces of the metal.

859
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:55,974
TALIESIN: If we pulled the two shoulder pieces
off, could we maybe tie them together and wear

860
00:53:55,974 --> 00:53:58,184
them like an Eat at Joe's sign?

861
00:53:58,184 --> 00:54:00,473
MATT: Could certainly try that if you want to,
yes.

862
00:54:00,473 --> 00:54:01,869
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it a roll.

863
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:08,474
MATT: Okay. I will say for this-- you know what,
go ahead and make a survival check

864
00:54:08,474 --> 00:54:09,906
on this to try and--

865
00:54:09,906 --> 00:54:14,941
TALIESIN: That's funny. No, I'm down. 12.

866
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:21,105
MATT: 12. You manage to (grunt) for a minute, with
some help from a couple other of the goblins, pull

867
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:24,085
one of the pauldrons off. You take it and--

868
00:54:24,085 --> 00:54:26,751
PHIL: Don't choke yourself!

869
00:54:26,751 --> 00:54:34,999
MATT: Based on your combat aesthetic, it's not
going to be much of a help to you.

870
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:41,186
IVAN: This is-- I never thought I would hear a
goblin character say this, but I can spellcraft to

871
00:54:41,186 --> 00:54:43,154
check to see if it's magical at all?

872
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,163
MATT: Sure. The armor?

873
00:54:44,163 --> 00:54:45,104
IVAN: The armor.

874
00:54:45,104 --> 00:54:46,289
MATT: Yeah. Go for it.

875
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:54,135
IVAN: I almost want to kick it into the cistern to
get it dirty. I'm sorry. I don't know why I

876
00:54:54,135 --> 00:54:57,526
rolled because I'm doing spellcraft. Yes, that's
right. 19.

877
00:54:57,526 --> 00:55:02,912
MATT: The armor itself does not appear to have a
magical essence to it. In fact, a close look--

878
00:55:02,912 --> 00:55:08,383
it's pretty close to the design of armor the
guards were wearing on the actual bridge itself.

879
00:55:08,383 --> 00:55:13,842
It's just completely polished down here in the middle
of a dank sewer.

880
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:16,836
ASHLY: Does the armor help any of the rest of us?
The goblin-crafted?

881
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:20,501
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw it at Piglet. Just
throw it at you.

882
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:22,230
MATT: It's delightful decoration.

883
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,336
ASHLY: Oh! Ho ho ho ho!

884
00:55:24,336 --> 00:55:31,215
IVAN: Are you Woody Woodpecker now? I think
something killed--

885
00:55:31,215 --> 00:55:35,386
PHIL: I think something is down here cleaning.
We've got to get out of here!

886
00:55:35,386 --> 00:55:37,570
Before it comes back!

887
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:41,381
IVAN: I don't want whatever cleaned this armor to
clean off Grizznak the Great's fine robes.

888
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:43,708
PHIL: It'll take the farts right out of you.

889
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,780
IVAN: Is there any way to climb up to the
grate?

890
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:51,147
MATT: It's about 40 feet up from you guys. The
path continues across the cistern

891
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,167
deeper into the city.

892
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:55,667
MARISHA: We didn't think about having to crawl
back out.

893
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:58,575
MATT: Beyond the cistern, the tunnel continues
after it converges.

894
00:55:58,575 --> 00:56:00,039
PHIL: Just keep going.

895
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:03,932
MATT: Who's leading this expedition now?

896
00:56:03,932 --> 00:56:07,180
PHIL: I think I'm more qualified to lead but I
don't like to be in front.

897
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,575
ASHLY: I have the prettiest hat.

898
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:10,731
PHIL: Piglet. I nominate you.

899
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:11,870
ASHLY: Hooray!

900
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:14,277
MATT: Piglet, go ahead and roll perception.

901
00:56:14,277 --> 00:56:19,667
ASHLY: (singing) I forget where my perception is
every time. There it is. 19.

902
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:31,112
MATT: 19, okay. All righty, so as you go-- as you
put your new shiny hat on and begin stepping

903
00:56:31,112 --> 00:56:37,793
forward across where the paths converge. You--
big, knees forward, stomping steps and you put

904
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:45,698
your head forward and stop as there's a distortion
in the air before you. And you breathe out, "huh?"

905
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:47,867
and it (wobbling noise) quivers.

906
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:54,135
IVAN: Step aside, step aside! Grizznak the Great
is here.

907
00:56:54,135 --> 00:56:57,128
PHIL: Great. Let's get ready to be hit by
lightning.

908
00:56:57,128 --> 00:57:04,370
IVAN: Well. It looks like something wobbly, so
it's probably magic.

909
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,055
MATT: You make a perception check.

910
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:10,041
IVAN: I'm going to percept the shit out of this

911
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:11,659
MARISHA: "Probably magic."

912
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:13,537
IVAN: "Probably magic." 14.

913
00:57:13,537 --> 00:57:19,294
MATT: 14. You pull her aside. There's nothing
visible in the air before you. You're wondering

914
00:57:19,294 --> 00:57:27,512
why she stopped, and as you step forward, you hit
something. At which point you guys watch as you

915
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:34,596
suddenly notice there is a large cube-like
creature made of some quivering gelatinous

916
00:57:34,596 --> 00:57:39,587
material. As Grizznak is slowly being
pulled into it.

917
00:57:39,587 --> 00:57:43,094
IVAN: No!

918
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:45,692
MATT: Everyone roll initiative.

919
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:47,412
IVAN: Guys guys guys!

920
00:57:47,412 --> 00:57:50,567
TALIESIN: That's how we do it. You did very well
in that. Add your initiative.

921
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:55,042
MARISHA: Oh, you found a waterbed! Aw, how cool,
man!

922
00:57:55,042 --> 00:58:01,824
Oh! Gelatinous cube!

923
00:58:01,824 --> 00:58:05,118
IVAN: Can I get my hands together? At all? Or are
my hands--

924
00:58:05,118 --> 00:58:11,163
MATT: You can certainly try here. We'll see how
this works out for you. All right, so initiative

925
00:58:11,163 --> 00:58:18,896
rolls here. Oh man. All right, all right. So
initiative orders, we have 20 to 15.

926
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:21,502
TALIESIN: 21.

927
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:25,346
PHIL: 25.

928
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:28,557
MARISHA: 15.

929
00:58:28,557 --> 00:58:30,621
ASHLY: I'm 19.

930
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:32,430
IVAN: 12!

931
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,720
MATT: What'd you get?

932
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,935
MARISHA: 15.

933
00:58:35,935 --> 00:58:40,199
IVAN: Grizznak is the best.

934
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:42,345
MATT: Grizznak, what did you roll?

935
00:58:42,345 --> 00:58:43,665
IVAN: 12.

936
00:58:43,665 --> 00:58:46,296
TALIESIN: That's how long. That's how long it
took. Are you happy now? Are you happy?

937
00:58:46,296 --> 00:58:52,637
ASHLY: (laughs) Oh! Oh no! I'm worried for
dick-butt.

938
00:58:52,637 --> 00:58:54,905
MARISHA: See! If you will it, it will happen.

939
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:56,749
MATT: It will happen, every time.

940
00:58:56,749 --> 00:58:59,581
MARISHA: Haven't you heard of the story of the
little boy with the magical paintbrush?

941
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:05,879
MATT: All right, so as you watch Grizznak
sucked into this giant creature, you see it

942
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:11,933
shifting and (squelching sounds). Top of the round
is Browntooth. Browntooth, what do you want to do

943
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:13,616
on your turn?

944
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,436
PHIL: Suppose I have to attack it.

945
00:59:16,436 --> 00:59:19,704
IVAN: Pull me out! Pull me out!

946
00:59:19,704 --> 00:59:25,629
PHIL: Can I attack him or can I kill it? All
right, I hit it with my cleaver.

947
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:29,614
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for attack.

948
00:59:29,614 --> 00:59:34,437
PHIL: 16. Do I add anything?

949
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,036
TALIESIN: Yeah, 16 plus--

950
00:59:36,036 --> 00:59:39,168
PHIL: Yes. 16 plus ten.

951
00:59:39,168 --> 00:59:41,413
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

952
00:59:41,413 --> 00:59:47,877
So you move up there. You can
move five feet and do your second attack if you

953
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:49,983
want to. You're close enough that you can attack
with both.

954
00:59:49,983 --> 00:59:54,153
PHIL: Oh great. Two.

955
00:59:54,153 --> 00:59:55,655
TALIESIN: Plus one.

956
00:59:55,655 --> 00:59:59,758
PHIL: Plus one, three. And do I do another one?

957
00:59:59,758 --> 01:00:02,452
TALIESIN: No, and then you have to do it for the
other hand, which is different, so you have to

958
01:00:02,452 --> 01:00:03,757
roll again to hit for the second one.

959
01:00:03,757 --> 01:00:05,518
MATT: So what's the damage on the first one?

960
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,500
PHIL: Three.

961
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,133
MATT: Three damage. All right.

962
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:10,335
TALIESIN: And then that's plus--

963
01:00:10,335 --> 01:00:13,306
PHIL: Five plus? Plus eight. 13.

964
01:00:13,306 --> 01:00:17,190
MATT: 13 does hit. It has a very low armor class
because it is a giant cube,

965
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,800
so go ahead and roll damage.

966
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,312
PHIL: Four.

967
01:00:22,312 --> 01:00:27,417
MATT: Nice. All right, so as you rush forward
taking your five-foot step and attack with your

968
01:00:27,616 --> 01:00:33,132
first goblin cleaver, you slice through part of
its form, then slice through with your second one.

969
01:00:33,132 --> 01:00:37,295
As you cut each time you can see it leaves a giant
opening and you cut a wedge out that

970
01:00:37,295 --> 01:00:43,689
(slurping noise) slops onto the ground and turns into a
slowly liquefying piece of water. The section that

971
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:47,976
you cut out begins to slowly reform but, however,
it does lose the mass that you cut of it. So it

972
01:00:47,976 --> 01:00:53,673
appears to be having some sort of impact. That
finishes your turn, Browntooth. Mezek, you're up.

973
01:00:53,673 --> 01:00:56,221
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to--

974
01:00:56,221 --> 01:01:04,827
MATT: However, actually real fast. 'Cause this is
part of the fun of it. Nope, actually, you're

975
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:09,151
good. You're up, Mezek. Sorry, keeping track of
the rules for the creature. I haven't used

976
01:01:09,151 --> 01:01:10,672
gelatinous cube in so long.

977
01:01:10,672 --> 01:01:12,489
IVAN: I was waiting to hear, "And Grizznak, you
were eaten."

978
01:01:12,489 --> 01:01:13,710
(laughter)

979
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,770
MATT: Technically, you were.

980
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,409
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a deep breath.
(screams)

981
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:20,617
ASHLY: Here he goes again.

982
01:01:20,617 --> 01:01:22,166
TALIESIN: And hit it with a stunning fist

983
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:24,065
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for the attack.

984
01:01:24,065 --> 01:01:27,312
MARISHA: He named it himself.

985
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,420
PHIL: And your eyes are lovely.

986
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,966
TALIESIN: One of them's mine. 16.

987
01:01:32,966 --> 01:01:35,304
MATT: 16 hits. Go ahead and roll damage for the
fist.

988
01:01:35,304 --> 01:01:37,549
IVAN: Don't stun the goblin inside, please.

989
01:01:37,549 --> 01:01:45,199
TALIESIN: Let's see. It's six points of damage.
And then they have to make a fortitude save.

990
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:46,782
MATT: What is the save DC?

991
01:01:46,782 --> 01:01:47,755
TALIESIN: 14.

992
01:01:47,755 --> 01:01:58,695
MATT: 14. It rolls a 14 plus-- Plus nine, yeah.
This cube is unaffected by your tiny goblin--

993
01:01:58,695 --> 01:01:59,893
TALIESIN: It does go wobble, wobble, wobble.

994
01:01:59,893 --> 01:02:01,144
MATT: It does. Wob, wob, wob, wob.

995
01:02:01,144 --> 01:02:02,840
(laughter)

996
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,566
IVAN: You can see me as I'm shifting.

997
01:02:04,566 --> 01:02:07,179
MARISHA: Cool.

998
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:12,860
MATT: So I'd say you moved into there. You going to
stay where you are?

999
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:18,578
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a step back and pull
out my quarterstaff. Now that I've had my turn.

1000
01:02:18,578 --> 01:02:21,879
MATT: Okay, so you step back. It does get an
attack of opportunity as you move back. Its giant

1001
01:02:21,879 --> 01:02:24,699
pseudopod shoots out towards you.

1002
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,992
IVAN: It wants to stunning fist you.

1003
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:31,657
MATT: That's a 12. What's your armor class?

1004
01:02:31,657 --> 01:02:34,374
TALIESIN: Touch AC? Or armor class?

1005
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:35,990
MATT: No, this is a general one.

1006
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:36,990
TALIESIN: 18.

1007
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,945
MATT: 18? Yeah, as it (whoosh) out towards you,
you duck low with your quick goblin reflexes.

1008
01:02:40,945 --> 01:02:44,768
Awesome, that ends your turn. Piglet, what do you
want to do?

1009
01:02:44,768 --> 01:02:46,474
ASHLY: I want to rage!

1010
01:02:46,474 --> 01:02:47,458
MATT: Okay.

1011
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:50,240
(laughter)

1012
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:56,315
MATT: You go into a full goblin Piglet rage.
Grabbing your oversized goblin skull-breaker

1013
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:59,241
hammer, go ahead and roll your attack.

1014
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:02,106
IVAN: I've always wanted to hear a goblin say
that.

1015
01:03:02,106 --> 01:03:05,460
ASHLY: Oh okay, so it was 20. Plus seven.

1016
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:09,532
MATT: 20 plus seven. That hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

1017
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:11,784
ASHLY: Where's a d10? Am I crazy?

1018
01:03:11,784 --> 01:03:15,388
TALIESIN: Do you need a d10? Here.

1019
01:03:15,388 --> 01:03:24,426
MATT: Also, Grizznak, I need you to roll a
constitution save. Sorry, a constitution base

1020
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,945
saving throw, fortitude save.

1021
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:34,153
ASHLY: So this is a d10 plus four. Oh, that's a
pretty one. Eight plus four. Times three? Is that

1022
01:03:34,153 --> 01:03:35,351
what that is, or?

1023
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:38,426
MATT: Well, no. It should say, your second attack
down, is during raging.

1024
01:03:38,426 --> 01:03:42,467
ASHLY: Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Oh, okay. So it's
eight plus six then.

1025
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:47,060
MATT: All right, there you go. 14 points of damage
as your hammer comes down. Wham! Hitting it,

1026
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:52,218
stopping an inch from the edge of Grizznak's face
as he turns and watches from inside. The whole

1027
01:03:52,218 --> 01:03:54,533
thing shakes from the impact.

1028
01:03:54,533 --> 01:03:56,318
ASHLY: Do I also get to bite because I'm raging?

1029
01:03:56,318 --> 01:03:57,325
MATT: You do.

1030
01:03:57,325 --> 01:04:00,904
PHIL: Ew. Lucky you.

1031
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:06,144
IVAN: I have so many feelings right now. Some of
them are wobbling.

1032
01:04:06,144 --> 01:04:07,321
ASHLY: 19.

1033
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:10,910
MATT: 19. That hits again. Go ahead and roll for
your bite damage. As you go in and bite a chunk

1034
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:13,872
out of this giant gelatinous mass like it's
dessert.

1035
01:04:13,872 --> 01:04:15,408
ASHLY: d3?

1036
01:04:15,408 --> 01:04:18,455
MATT: Yeah, so roll a d6 and divide by two.

1037
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:21,483
ASHLY: Okay. Boop. So it's a three.

1038
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,081
TALIESIN: That would be two.

1039
01:04:23,081 --> 01:04:24,904
MATT: Yeah, so that would be two. Two plus?

1040
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:25,923
ASHLY: Plus three.

1041
01:04:25,923 --> 01:04:32,096
MATT: Two plus three. So you do five points of
damage. Giant goblin maw bites into the side, once

1042
01:04:32,096 --> 01:04:34,713
again near Grizznak's face.

1043
01:04:34,713 --> 01:04:36,823
PHIL: She's raging. She doesn't know where she is.

1044
01:04:36,823 --> 01:04:39,966
MATT: As you pull a bit away, immediately as you
pull back, the rage is in you, you don't really

1045
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:43,015
notice the fact that your mouth has gone tingling
and you've lost all sensation in your mouth.

1046
01:04:43,015 --> 01:04:44,154
ASHLY: Oh no.

1047
01:04:44,154 --> 01:04:47,120
MARISHA: Hey Piglet! How's the jello monster?

1048
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,343
ASHLY: Delicious.

1049
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:52,777
MATT: As you blah, drools out. As she talks, her
lips are numb. It's like blah, blah, blah.

1050
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:54,384
(laughter)

1051
01:04:54,384 --> 01:04:59,785
MATT: It dribbles down the front of her body.
Yeah. Your tongue and mouth aren't moving like

1052
01:04:59,785 --> 01:05:04,211
they should. You're a goblin that got out of the
dentist right now, because you took a bite out of it.

1053
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:06,181
MARISHA: The novocaine cube.

1054
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:09,738
ASHLY: Novocaine cube. That's awesome.

1055
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:12,892
MATT: Grizznak, did you roll your fortitude save?

1056
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:18,128
IVAN: My fortitude save? No, I haven't. Oh god.
Fortitude save. 11?

1057
01:05:18,128 --> 01:05:20,047
MATT: 11. Okay.

1058
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:23,964
IVAN: Question mark?

1059
01:05:23,964 --> 01:05:28,100
MATT: Okay, you are currently paralyzed for eight
rounds.

1060
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,740
MARISHA and ASHLY: What?!

1061
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:37,044
MATT: Being engulfed by this entity, it's actually
caused all of your muscles to lock up. And you

1062
01:05:37,044 --> 01:05:41,056
feel that same tingling sensation as you glance
over and all the little hairs that might be

1063
01:05:41,056 --> 01:05:44,445
protruding on your body dissolve. And part of your
skin begins to peel away.

1064
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:52,402
IVAN: I still have the last look that I had, which
is this stupid face of awe and wonder of Piglet

1065
01:05:52,402 --> 01:05:55,929
raging. And that's all that's on my face right now
as I'm paralyzed inside of the cube.

1066
01:05:55,929 --> 01:06:01,931
MATT: All right, so finishing Piglet's turn, that
comes to you, Snizzler. What are you going to do?

1067
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:06,880
MARISHA: Does he have any limbs or anything that
are sticking out still that are accessible?

1068
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,129
MATT: No. No. He is fully engulfed by the entity
right now.

1069
01:06:09,129 --> 01:06:10,369
ASHLY: Oh shit.

1070
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:12,049
MARISHA: Where am I on the map?

1071
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:17,059
MATT: You are right there. By the way, this is the
opening. This drops down about 20 feet and the

1072
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:20,658
water is pouring into that, right behind you. So
be careful where you're stepping.

1073
01:06:20,658 --> 01:06:29,492
MARISHA: Oh, that's good to know. Okay. Snizzler
runs up, takes out a pipe bomb. (clicking noise)

1074
01:06:29,492 --> 01:06:33,814
Can I shove the pipe bomb in the jello?

1075
01:06:33,814 --> 01:06:35,371
MATT: You can, if you want to.

1076
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:38,678
MARISHA: Is it going to start sucking me in when I
do that?

1077
01:06:38,678 --> 01:06:40,063
TALIESIN: (shushes) Go with it. Go with it.

1078
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:42,649
MATT: You want to go with it? So you take a step
forward, you--

1079
01:06:42,649 --> 01:06:47,678
MARISHA: I want to find the hole Piglet made and
aim for that.

1080
01:06:47,678 --> 01:06:48,994
MATT: Okay, so you're going to step into there.

1081
01:06:48,994 --> 01:06:52,980
MARISHA: And (grunts). Explosive bomb.

1082
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:59,924
MATT: So you watch as this haphazard piece of
metal shrapnel that's been matted together with

1083
01:06:59,924 --> 01:07:08,743
pig feces and twine, goes (sticking noise). And is
now right in front of you as you see a little fuse

1084
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:10,228
going (sizzling).

1085
01:07:10,228 --> 01:07:14,517
IVAN: I can't scream because I'm paralyzed, but
inside, I'm screaming. I'm screaming very loudly.

1086
01:07:14,517 --> 01:07:17,104
MARISHA: And I look at Grizz and I go--

1087
01:07:17,104 --> 01:07:18,916
MATT: Are you going to stay right there?

1088
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:24,268
MARISHA: And I take a few steps back. Not into the
hole.

1089
01:07:24,268 --> 01:07:33,066
MATT: So it would probably be one, two, three.
We'll put you there. As you do that and pull back,

1090
01:07:33,066 --> 01:07:37,221
another giant pseudopod goes (whoosh) out towards
you and slams into the stone next to you, but you

1091
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:39,928
go, huh. That's the least of your worries, right
now.

1092
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:41,502
MARISHA: Hang on one second, man.

1093
01:07:41,502 --> 01:07:49,819
MATT: As you pull back, there's an explosion sound
as it bursts inside the cube. So I want you to go

1094
01:07:49,819 --> 01:07:54,363
ahead and roll for an attack on this. Just for the
purposes of this.

1095
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:57,181
MARISHA: Sorry, Grizz. 18.

1096
01:07:57,181 --> 01:08:02,572
MATT: 18, so yeah. This is a direct hit on the
creature. So go ahead and do your firebomb damage

1097
01:08:02,572 --> 01:08:03,923
to the cube.

1098
01:08:03,923 --> 01:08:05,236
IVAN: Oh, how much damage is it?

1099
01:08:05,236 --> 01:08:07,667
MARISHA: Aw, it went into my soy sauce but I'm
going to take it because it was a six.

1100
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,519
(laughter)

1101
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:13,041
MARISHA: Ten plus three plus another d4--

1102
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:14,155
PHIL: That's what you call--

1103
01:08:14,155 --> 01:08:16,584
PHIL and TALIESIN: --a salt with a deadly
weapon.

1104
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:21,773
MARISHA: So 15 points of damage.

1105
01:08:21,773 --> 01:08:26,360
MATT: 15 points of fire damage as it bursts on the
inside. You are paralyzed, cannot make a reflex

1106
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:32,092
saving throw, you take six points of fire damage from
being in the blast radius of this thing.

1107
01:08:32,092 --> 01:08:35,518
MARISHA: I was going to say, I do want to do an
explosive bomb, so direct hits catch fire, dealing

1108
01:08:35,518 --> 01:08:38,021
an additional 1d6 fire damage every round.

1109
01:08:38,021 --> 01:08:48,439
MATT: Oh. Good to know. So the actual cube is also
on fire. Due to the blast radius-- Because of the

1110
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:53,398
size of your explosion too, because it is the
ten-foot, I need both of you guys to roll reflex

1111
01:08:53,398 --> 01:08:55,689
saving throws, if you could.

1112
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:58,412
ASHLY: I think it's a 20.

1113
01:08:58,412 --> 01:09:01,119
MATT: Yep, d20, and add your reflex save.

1114
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:03,707
ASHLY: 17.

1115
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:04,746
PHIL: 16.

1116
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:08,981
MATT: 16. It's half damage, right, for that, so
both of you take three points of fire damage, as

1117
01:09:08,981 --> 01:09:16,372
the blast radius of this sends chunks of this
creature sticking to the ceiling and slopping down.

1118
01:09:16,372 --> 01:09:17,675
PHIL: I have evasion.

1119
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:19,468
MATT: You take none because you're a rogue.

1120
01:09:19,468 --> 01:09:23,727
IVAN: Have I at least been blown out of the cube
or am I still inside of the cube?

1121
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:27,656
MATT: You're like partially out of it, right now,
with the blast radius. But--

1122
01:09:27,656 --> 01:09:29,291
IVAN: So slightly exposed.

1123
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:32,577
MATT: You're slightly exposed. It's partially
exposed. And as you're there, going (muffled

1124
01:09:32,577 --> 01:09:42,172
screaming), it (sucking noise, muffled screaming).
Closing around you slowly. All right, that

1125
01:09:42,172 --> 01:09:48,253
finishes your turn. Now it is your turn. You take
two points of acid damage as it begins to slowly

1126
01:09:48,253 --> 01:09:50,023
digest you from the inside.

1127
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:58,149
IVAN: So guys, I will probably not last another
couple of rounds. Just to be clear, so.

1128
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:59,900
TALIESIN: Working on it.

1129
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:06,375
IVAN: The skin is starting, but beyond just the
burning, oh god, the burning, there is-- you can

1130
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:12,807
see as most of Grizznak's robes have been
dissolved into nothingness, and part of his goblin

1131
01:10:12,807 --> 01:10:22,087
face is starting to peel off, revealing my
immensely beautiful crooked teeth. So, yeah.

1132
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:27,607
TALIESIN: If my parents taught me anything, it's
that a burning sensation is nothing to worry

1133
01:10:27,607 --> 01:10:29,580
about. You're good, you're good.

1134
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:32,011
MATT: All right, so as you two are there right in
front of it, the thing begins reforming the front

1135
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:35,949
of it, which is currently blown open from the bomb
that Snizzler left in there. It begins to shift

1136
01:10:35,949 --> 01:10:40,564
and slither towards both of you guys and intending
to engulf you as well. I need you both to go ahead

1137
01:10:40,564 --> 01:10:41,918
and make reflex saving throws.

1138
01:10:41,918 --> 01:10:43,432
MARISHA: Oh man.

1139
01:10:43,432 --> 01:10:51,016
ASHLY: No! I got seven. Do I get to know what the
result would be before I use my song?

1140
01:10:51,016 --> 01:10:52,460
IVAN: You just get to reroll.

1141
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,980
MATT: You don't know what the result is, but do
you want to use your song now?

1142
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,709
MARISHA: Is that adding your reflex?

1143
01:10:57,709 --> 01:11:00,763
ASHLY: I had a seven. Yeah, adding my reflex.

1144
01:11:00,763 --> 01:11:01,998
MARISHA: Adding your reflex.

1145
01:11:01,998 --> 01:11:04,392
MATT: What'd you get? Browntooth?

1146
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:10,724
PHIL: I got a 19 plus nine. 28.

1147
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:13,620
MATT: Okay, you dart out of the way into the
groove here as it moves forward.

1148
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,705
PHIL: Which is what I was planning to do anyway.

1149
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:20,664
MATT: So as you duck, as it begins to shift
forward, Piglet, in a moment of intensity, staring

1150
01:11:20,664 --> 01:11:30,533
into the face of this for the first time, probably
your entire life, you're like, I can die. What?

1151
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:31,702
What are you going to do?

1152
01:11:31,702 --> 01:11:34,664
ASHLY: I decide, no, I'm going to live forever,
and I'll sing my song.

1153
01:11:34,664 --> 01:11:36,032
MATT: All right, go for it. What's your song?

1154
01:11:36,032 --> 01:11:39,942
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to try a thing. I don't
know if it's going to work.

1155
01:11:39,942 --> 01:11:41,114
MATT: All right.

1156
01:11:41,114 --> 01:11:46,740
ASHLY: I'm going to try to sing my song to the
tune of Kiss from a Rose. Because that's my go-to.

1157
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:50,594
TALIESIN: You're my favorite. Oh god.

1158
01:11:50,594 --> 01:12:08,976
ASHLY: Let's see. (sings) Piglet, twitchy scratch
the rash until she sees them loud. Love trash,

1159
01:12:08,976 --> 01:12:16,035
lift the hammer down and crash. Piglet angry time
to smash. Sorry.

1160
01:12:16,035 --> 01:12:20,790
MATT: Well done. So go ahead and reroll your
reflex.

1161
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:23,044
IVAN: Please post those lyrics at some point.

1162
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:24,533
ASHLY: I got a two again.

1163
01:12:24,533 --> 01:12:25,898
TALIESIN: No!

1164
01:12:25,898 --> 01:12:28,334
ASHLY: I am going to die.

1165
01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:31,715
PHIL: I mean, it wasn't a very good song.

1166
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:34,525
MARISHA: Fuck you, Seal. Fuck you.

1167
01:12:34,525 --> 01:12:37,444
ASHLY: No! Shit.

1168
01:12:37,444 --> 01:12:42,615
MATT: The creature has now engulfed both Piglet
and you get pulled up right next to it, jammed

1169
01:12:42,615 --> 01:12:49,220
into the currently paralyzed Grizznak. I need you
to go ahead and make a fortitude saving throw.

1170
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:52,687
ASHLY: Oh my. Okay. It's the 20?

1171
01:12:52,687 --> 01:12:59,113
TALIESIN: Here. Go nuts. That's the serious
business die.

1172
01:12:59,113 --> 01:13:00,863
ASHLY: 14.

1173
01:13:00,863 --> 01:13:02,469
TALIESIN: There we go.

1174
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:03,716
ASHLY: 19.

1175
01:13:03,716 --> 01:13:05,161
This is beautiful.

1176
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:06,837
TALIESIN: Thank you. That's the angry die.

1177
01:13:06,837 --> 01:13:08,349
ASHLY: That's the goddammit die.

1178
01:13:08,349 --> 01:13:10,931
PHIL: Goddammit, don't die.

1179
01:13:10,931 --> 01:13:16,633
MATT: And as you're pulled into it, trying to find
your way through, you get pulled into the thing,

1180
01:13:16,633 --> 01:13:22,423
and you feel like that same numb sensation all
across. Which, by the way, your goblin song maybe

1181
01:13:22,423 --> 01:13:26,030
missed a few vowels because of the blahlah, but
the rest of your body begins to tingle and you

1182
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,617
begin to fight against it and your body won't
move.

1183
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:29,859
MARISHA: No!

1184
01:13:29,859 --> 01:13:31,385
MATT: Your body's paralyzed for six rounds.

1185
01:13:31,385 --> 01:13:32,969
PHIL: Only six.

1186
01:13:32,969 --> 01:13:39,262
MATT: Jammed up against-- However, it does take
another d6 points of fire damage from your bomb. So

1187
01:13:39,262 --> 01:13:43,084
go ahead and roll that if you could.

1188
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:44,402
MARISHA: Four.

1189
01:13:44,402 --> 01:13:49,766
MATT: Four points of fire damage. All righty. All
right, that brings us back to the top, Browntooth,

1190
01:13:49,766 --> 01:13:52,257
you're up. You dodge to the side. You see it
engulf--

1191
01:13:52,257 --> 01:13:55,903
PHIL: Is it moving away from me?

1192
01:13:55,903 --> 01:13:59,929
MATT: It is. It moved this way and you sidestep
and it's moving parallel to you.

1193
01:13:59,929 --> 01:14:04,295
PHIL: Okay. I would like to get behind it and
shoot my crossbow.

1194
01:14:04,295 --> 01:14:07,039
MATT: Okay. So you move--

1195
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:12,419
PHIL: Because I've decided I don't want any more
hand-to-hand combat. Seems like a bad idea.

1196
01:14:12,419 --> 01:14:15,530
MATT: A pseudopod swings out towards you but you--
it misses you entirely. As you dart backward with

1197
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:18,729
your crossbow loaded, you take aim and go ahead
and fire.

1198
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:29,647
PHIL: This one, right? Fuck. Seven plus nine. 16.

1199
01:14:29,647 --> 01:14:35,419
MATT: You've heard the term "couldn't hit the
broad side of a barn"? Thankfully, this creature

1200
01:14:35,419 --> 01:14:42,363
is the size of a barn. You manage to sink the bolt
into it. Go ahead and roll damage. You feel a

1201
01:14:42,363 --> 01:14:48,011
slight bit of pain at your back as a bolt nips you
in the butt. But you can't do anything about it

1202
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:58,245
because you're paralyzed. Five points of damage.
All right. You guys can see the creature's shaking

1203
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:01,695
and shimmering as it's moving forward. It's having
a hard time keeping its form together, it's

1204
01:15:01,695 --> 01:15:05,274
looking really rough as it's slowly dissolving
your two friends.

1205
01:15:05,274 --> 01:15:08,316
MARISHA: Burn! Fire!

1206
01:15:08,316 --> 01:15:11,102
MATT: All right, that's going to go ahead and
bring us to Mezek.

1207
01:15:11,102 --> 01:15:15,002
TALIESIN: I am going to charge it with my
quarterstaff and hit it with a flurry of blows. I

1208
01:15:15,002 --> 01:15:16,654
don't have any Ki points right now, do I?

1209
01:15:16,654 --> 01:15:24,961
MATT: No because you are sober-- You require a
full round action to do flurry of bros. (laughs)

1210
01:15:24,961 --> 01:15:26,502
MARISHA: Fury of bros? (laughs)

1211
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,722
PHIL : Fury of bros, (screams) yeah dude!

1212
01:15:28,722 --> 01:15:30,525
TALIESIN: Okay, so I can't make a movement.

1213
01:15:30,525 --> 01:15:35,803
MATT: You are two squares away from it, so in
order to get into it you would have to do a full

1214
01:15:35,803 --> 01:15:37,929
round action.

1215
01:15:37,929 --> 01:15:49,269
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll take the-- I'll take a nice
big, flying swing with my stick.

1216
01:15:49,269 --> 01:15:51,875
MATT: Go for it.

1217
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:55,568
TALIESIN: (goblin screech) That's 13.

1218
01:15:55,568 --> 01:15:57,585
MATT: 13 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1219
01:15:57,585 --> 01:16:03,597
TALIESIN: God damn. That's seven. Seven points of
damage.

1220
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:05,829
MATT: Seven points of damage--

1221
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:08,678
How do you want to do this?

1222
01:16:08,678 --> 01:16:14,356
TALIESIN: I want to, screaming bloody murder,
squish it and splash it with the stick like you

1223
01:16:14,356 --> 01:16:18,438
were trying to hit a rat scurrying around on the
ground, and I don't care, once it's gone, I'm

1224
01:16:18,438 --> 01:16:23,807
going to keep hitting them. I'm going to keep
slapping and slapping until it's mush.

1225
01:16:23,807 --> 01:16:29,815
MATT: Okay. You guys watch as Mezek goes batshit
insane on this cube, smacks into the side, manages

1226
01:16:29,815 --> 01:16:33,480
to hit a core of its form where some of the bones
are floating inside from previous victims.

1227
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,514
Probably the shiny things you saw earlier, the
person that once wore it, bits of them are

1228
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:43,852
floating inside. As it begins to collapse on
itself like an order of cold flan and as it

1229
01:16:43,852 --> 01:16:48,309
liquefies, part of it pouring into the cistern,
the two of their bodies are starting to be pulled

1230
01:16:48,309 --> 01:16:51,311
into the cistern with its form, unable to keep
shape.

1231
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:52,567
ASHLY: Help! Help! Help!

1232
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:53,857
TALIESIN: I run in and grab them!

1233
01:16:53,857 --> 01:16:57,365
MARISHA: Yeah, I help as well. Oh, Grizz!

1234
01:16:57,365 --> 01:17:01,853
MATT: Okay. You guys grab them, pull them out onto
the side. The last bit of the flaming corpse of

1235
01:17:01,853 --> 01:17:08,598
this cube sloshes into the cistern. You wait about
another minute or so before you both get your

1236
01:17:08,598 --> 01:17:09,956
bodies back.

1237
01:17:09,956 --> 01:17:15,463
MARISHA: I take a little goo out of his ear and
I-- Ah, yeah, it's got a little kick there, yeah,

1238
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:16,770
you're right.

1239
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:22,899
IVAN: I take my nose and go-- and I watch as goo
goes (wet noise) out of my ears.

1240
01:17:22,899 --> 01:17:27,365
ASHLY: Is this what being greased feels like?
Because I don't like it.

1241
01:17:27,365 --> 01:17:28,603
TALIESIN: It's not easy--

1242
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:30,323
ASHLY, PHIL and TALIESIN: Being greased.

1243
01:17:30,323 --> 01:17:39,713
MATT: So as you're resting up from this, do you
guys need to do anything to heal up a bit?

1244
01:17:39,713 --> 01:17:43,724
IVAN: If we had things in which to heal up with,
but as of course--

1245
01:17:43,724 --> 01:17:46,254
MARISHA: Do we get any healing surges or anything
like that?

1246
01:17:46,254 --> 01:17:49,085
MATT: No. This is Pathfinder, girl.

1247
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:53,657
IVAN: This is not like fourth edition. I don't
think we have anything because I certainly didn't

1248
01:17:53,657 --> 01:17:55,280
take it and we have no real--

1249
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,691
TALIESIN: I have the healing skill, can we try and
use the healing skill to reset things?

1250
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:06,965
MATT: Sure I'll let you do that, being the monk
that you are.

1251
01:18:06,965 --> 01:18:15,606
PHIL: When they say it couldn't hurt, I'm not sure
they're right.

1252
01:18:15,606 --> 01:18:17,831
TALIESIN: 20!

1253
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:23,575
MATT: 20? And with that, with the various burn
wounds on your body, from the acid that's burned

1254
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:28,982
away and parts of the actual burn damage you've
taken from the explosion, Mezek rushes in and like

1255
01:18:28,982 --> 01:18:31,102
the roughest masseuse you've ever seen--

1256
01:18:31,102 --> 01:18:33,106
IVAN: It's like the best shiatsu massage I've ever
gotten.

1257
01:18:33,106 --> 01:18:40,164
TALIESIN: Let go! Let go! You're holding a lot of
tension!

1258
01:18:40,164 --> 01:18:45,371
IVAN: Ugh, that's good, that one right there. That
knot especially.

1259
01:18:45,371 --> 01:18:47,635
PHIL: Don't forget to breathe.

1260
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:54,806
MATT: I'd say for that, go ahead and heal four
points due to the rhythmic massage of Mezek's

1261
01:18:54,806 --> 01:18:56,852
rough and tumble goblin hands.

1262
01:18:56,852 --> 01:19:05,960
IVAN: I would like to point out that you just healed me
through a goblin shiatsu massage,

1263
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,233
that was amazing.

1264
01:19:07,233 --> 01:19:08,868
MATT: Yes, yep that happened.

1265
01:19:08,868 --> 01:19:12,842
TALIESIN: With vomit-based massage oil! It's
organic!

1266
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:14,366
ASHLY: Only the finest for you.

1267
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:20,651
IVAN: I step up and I crack my back a little bit
and okay. We're good to go. Let's do this.

1268
01:19:20,651 --> 01:19:25,786
TALIESIN: Do any of my flasks or jugs have any
liquor in them?

1269
01:19:25,786 --> 01:19:28,295
MATT: No. However, make a perception check.

1270
01:19:28,295 --> 01:19:33,137
ASHLY: I also have a jug, I don't know what's in
it.

1271
01:19:33,137 --> 01:19:34,183
TALIESIN: 20.

1272
01:19:34,183 --> 01:19:41,222
MATT: 20. You have a jug, it's mainly sloshing
water and grime, your usual-- what you like to sip

1273
01:19:41,222 --> 01:19:44,927
on the way of your journey. Whatever you find
along the way. You guys are into this whole

1274
01:19:44,927 --> 01:19:48,270
scavenging thing. As you're thinking about this,
ah, you didn't bring any alcohol,

1275
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:50,864
you smell alcohol.

1276
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:55,237
TALIESIN: (sniffs) Happy juice. Happy juice!

1277
01:19:55,237 --> 01:20:00,660
MATT: All of a sudden you guys watch as Mezek
darts down the path--

1278
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:06,496
IVAN: Follow him! He found booze, which means when
there's booze there's stuff and a happy Mezek.

1279
01:20:06,496 --> 01:20:08,092
MARISHA: Yeah, I like that.

1280
01:20:08,092 --> 01:20:13,649
MATT: As you dart ahead, you come to the edge, and
you can see there the path continues for another

1281
01:20:13,649 --> 01:20:18,083
200 feet before it dips off, but you don't know
quite where. But the scent is strong here and you

1282
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:24,058
look over and you can see the wall to your
immediate right actually has a fissure in it. A

1283
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:28,437
part of it has cracked or a part of it has
semi-eroded away. And you can see the very distant

1284
01:20:28,437 --> 01:20:30,510
dark glimmer of something beyond it.

1285
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,227
TALIESIN: I stick my hand in and go for it.

1286
01:20:33,227 --> 01:20:34,954
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check.

1287
01:20:34,954 --> 01:20:39,618
TALIESIN: That's not funny. Eight.

1288
01:20:39,618 --> 01:20:44,859
MATT: Eight. You go and grab the stone, you
lift your whole goblin body up on it and start pulling. You

1289
01:20:44,954 --> 01:20:48,398
guys catch up and see Mezek fighting with this
wall and making no headway whatsoever.

1290
01:20:48,398 --> 01:20:50,211
TALIESIN: Piglet! Piglet!

1291
01:20:50,211 --> 01:20:52,410
ASHLY: Okay, let me smash this with the hammer.

1292
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:57,155
IVAN: I was going to say, I'm going to grab
Mezek's waist and help him pull, so that we're just

1293
01:20:57,155 --> 01:20:59,471
two goblins pulling on it now.

1294
01:20:59,471 --> 01:21:02,403
MATT: (laughs) Okay, so you guys are just like
double-pulling on it. You make a strength check

1295
01:21:02,403 --> 01:21:04,145
as well. Go ahead and roll an attack against the
wall.

1296
01:21:04,145 --> 01:21:06,105
MARISHA: Is Mezek getting in a fight with a
wall again?

1297
01:21:06,105 --> 01:21:07,955
IVAN: He does this, just humor him.

1298
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,361
PHIL: He usually loses.

1299
01:21:09,361 --> 01:21:12,558
ASHLY: 17? Is this plus strength?

1300
01:21:12,558 --> 01:21:14,034
TALIESIN: Plus strength modifier.

1301
01:21:14,034 --> 01:21:19,574
MATT: Well, go ahead and roll damage because you
hit the wall. Outside of a critical fail,

1302
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:21,222
you're fine.

1303
01:21:21,222 --> 01:21:23,383
ASHLY: So should I do my normal?

1304
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:28,173
MATT: Yes, a normal d10 plus-- you're not raging,
so that would be a plus four.

1305
01:21:28,173 --> 01:21:29,669
ASHLY: Five.

1306
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:37,172
MATT: Five points of damage. As you guys are
pulling, the hammer comes down as Piglet smashes

1307
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:42,920
into the side of this wall. The stones crumble inward and
you both go flung forward into the darkness,

1308
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:48,836
tumbling over each other before you both (impact
noise) against the wall, slowly slide down. As you

1309
01:21:48,836 --> 01:21:57,242
look around, you're inside this darkened chamber.
Glancing around you, first off you immediately

1310
01:21:57,242 --> 01:21:59,537
notice that there is a heavy smell of alcohol in
this room.

1311
01:21:59,537 --> 01:22:05,732
IVAN: We're in one of those, humans call them a
"Ta-vern" or one--

1312
01:22:05,732 --> 01:22:10,944
MARISHA: This is one of those cel-lar. Cel-lar?

1313
01:22:10,944 --> 01:22:16,678
IVAN: It's, yeah, it's where they do their
fighting at. It's basically where humans go to

1314
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:18,519
beat up each other. It's a goblin pit!

1315
01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:19,985
TALIESIN: Sounds like heaven.

1316
01:22:19,985 --> 01:22:21,184
IVAN: It's amazing.

1317
01:22:21,184 --> 01:22:24,017
ASHLY: I've heard they also "pick up chicks".
Whatever that means.

1318
01:22:24,017 --> 01:22:25,616
TALIESIN: Baby chickens?

1319
01:22:25,616 --> 01:22:31,583
ASHLY: (loudly) There are chickens here?! It's
like a "hoo-er house", right?

1320
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:36,771
PHIL: Do they eat owls, too? Chickens and owls?
I'm getting hungry!

1321
01:22:36,771 --> 01:22:38,184
TALIESIN: Baby owls!

1322
01:22:38,184 --> 01:22:41,682
MATT: Which, as you guys are getting hungry, you
look around this chamber you're in, you see a sack

1323
01:22:41,682 --> 01:22:52,562
of moldy grains, small containers of salts and
spices, dried meats that are put on racks against the wall,

1324
01:22:52,562 --> 01:22:57,577
casks and bottles of wine, and ale all throughout
this--

1325
01:22:57,577 --> 01:22:59,407
TALIESIN: Done. Ale? Done. Going for the ale.

1326
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:04,080
IVAN: We forgot about our mission for as long as
it takes for us to eat everything in this cellar.

1327
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:09,653
MATT: You guys go nuts! Devouring everything,
grabbing at meat, filling your bellies. You'd

1328
01:23:09,653 --> 01:23:11,868
be welcome to fill your jugs with alcohol--

1329
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:13,701
TALIESIN: I'm filling my flask and my waterskin.

1330
01:23:13,701 --> 01:23:16,948
MATT: Do you clear out your
jug first, or are you just going to add to it?

1331
01:23:17,338 --> 01:23:19,489
TALIESIN: No, I'm just going to add it.

1332
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:21,000
MATT: All right, cool.

1333
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,553
IVAN: Does this help me at all with my current hit
point situation?

1334
01:23:23,553 --> 01:23:25,324
MARISHA: Eat up, maybe?

1335
01:23:25,324 --> 01:23:32,621
MATT: For the circumstances here, you heal
one hit point from the food--

1336
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:36,387
TALIESIN: We all heal one?

1337
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:45,875
IVAN: But yeah, I will eat it all, if anything it
will allow me to feel better.

1338
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:48,955
MATT: I will say, if you want to go ahead and tear
into that moldy grain, that might heal you a

1339
01:23:48,955 --> 01:23:52,891
little more, but it looks like your stomach might
have a rough time with it.

1340
01:23:52,891 --> 01:23:54,122
Do you want to go for it?

1341
01:23:54,122 --> 01:23:56,630
TALIESIN: Maybe you have to have a chat with a
spirit animal.

1342
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:57,907
IVAN: I'm a god damn goblin.

1343
01:23:57,907 --> 01:23:59,293
TALIESIN: Nothing bad happens when you eat moldy
grain.

1344
01:23:59,293 --> 01:24:01,010
MATT: You get on top of that moldy grain, you tear
into it, you destroy it--

1345
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:07,500
IVAN: I'm going to-- at one point I'm going to take
one of the pots and I'm going to scoop it, and I'm

1346
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:13,956
going to pour it over my head because I know that
moldy grain has healing properties. And as I put

1347
01:24:13,956 --> 01:24:17,982
it into my mouth I'm going to rub it all over my
burning sores.

1348
01:24:17,982 --> 01:24:21,389
PHIL: I call you Grizznak the Glutinous.

1349
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:22,842
(laughter)

1350
01:24:22,842 --> 01:24:25,597
TALIESIN: I'm imagining Orson Welles at the end of
Apocalypse Now! right now, with the towel--

1351
01:24:25,597 --> 01:24:33,655
IVAN: Also Arcane Mark on the cellar wall, Goblin
Dickbutt, Grizznak the Great has been here.

1352
01:24:33,655 --> 01:24:39,907
MATT: As you go ahead and focus over on the wall,
you hear this rumbling in your stomach. Go ahead

1353
01:24:39,907 --> 01:24:41,575
and roll a fortitude saving throw.

1354
01:24:41,575 --> 01:24:44,074
IVAN: Yeah, I'm really good at fortitude saves,
why can't I do will saves, ever? Fortitude

1355
01:24:44,074 --> 01:24:46,163
saves... shit.

1356
01:24:46,163 --> 01:24:47,850
PHIL: (cackles) Literally.

1357
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,034
IVAN: Eight.

1358
01:24:49,034 --> 01:24:56,232
MATT: Well, the good news is you heal three
additional hit points as your goblin metabolism

1359
01:24:56,232 --> 01:25:06,501
takes in the horrible, moldy grain. The downside
is, you then vomit up all the moldy grain, and you

1360
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,130
lose the hit points.

1361
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:11,220
ASHLY: I'm going to get rid of the wine and put
that all in my jug.

1362
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,251
MATT: Okay.

1363
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:14,132
IVAN: I feel great until I vomit it back up
again.

1364
01:25:14,132 --> 01:25:16,705
ASHLY: I had all the wine in my jug, and I got rid
of it and filled it with vomit.

1365
01:25:16,705 --> 01:25:25,226
PHIL: I'd like to secretly pocket some of the
dried meats. To take with me.

1366
01:25:25,226 --> 01:25:27,645
MATT: Secretly, so nobody else sees it, or--

1367
01:25:27,645 --> 01:25:29,062
PHIL: No, they don't see it.

1368
01:25:29,062 --> 01:25:30,701
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.

1369
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:33,349
TALIESIN: I like a man with secrets. Oh my--

1370
01:25:33,349 --> 01:25:37,229
ASHLY: He just shoved an entire cow down his
pants.

1371
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:38,508
PHIL: 32.

1372
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,032
TALIESIN: He rolled a-- tell him what you rolled.

1373
01:25:40,032 --> 01:25:42,338
PHIL: I rolled a natural 20 with a plus 12
sleight-of-hand.

1374
01:25:42,338 --> 01:25:46,034
MATT: (laughs) As everyone else is marveling
themselves at this display of goblin gluttony, you

1375
01:25:46,034 --> 01:25:51,941
step backwards and somehow in the process of
giving your fellow goblins a little bit of a head

1376
01:25:51,941 --> 01:25:56,417
nod, you have managed to fill all of your pouches
and pockets with every single piece of meat on

1377
01:25:56,417 --> 01:26:04,246
that wall. It goes from full to empty in a second,
and no one's the wiser. You got like saddle bags

1378
01:26:04,246 --> 01:26:07,069
filled with food right now and no one seems to
have noticed.

1379
01:26:07,069 --> 01:26:09,691
IVAN: Browntooth! You're looking very fit.

1380
01:26:09,691 --> 01:26:11,701
PHIL: Well, I work out.

1381
01:26:11,701 --> 01:26:13,112
MARISHA: You're very curvy.

1382
01:26:13,112 --> 01:26:14,349
IVAN: So curvy.

1383
01:26:14,349 --> 01:26:16,795
MARISHA: And you've got a little junk in the
trunk, looks good.

1384
01:26:16,795 --> 01:26:19,456
PHIL: Yeah, y'know. Comes from my mother's side.

1385
01:26:19,456 --> 01:26:22,396
MARISHA: Ah, sure, yeah. Your mom, man.

1386
01:26:22,396 --> 01:26:25,159
MATT: As you guys are finishing this mountain of
goblin gluttony, we're going to go ahead and take

1387
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:27,438
a quick break here, we'll be back here in a few
minutes.

1388
01:26:27,438 --> 01:26:34,537
MARISHA: Don't let me forget, I want to try and
find some wine bottles for molotov cocktails,

1389
01:26:34,537 --> 01:26:35,993
don't let me forget.

1390
01:26:35,993 --> 01:26:38,544
MATT: All right. We'll be right back.

1391
01:26:38,544 --> 01:38:53,168
[break]

1392
01:38:53,168 --> 01:38:59,728
MATT: Welcome back. So. We've had a little break
here, we're coming back into the chaos here. So,

1393
01:38:59,728 --> 01:39:06,448
this goblin band, having taken root in this
storage basement beneath this human barn, the

1394
01:39:06,448 --> 01:39:09,131
center of the town of Sandpoint, you've--

1395
01:39:09,131 --> 01:39:13,336
MARISHA: Oh, wait, I want to make sure I find some
wine bottles, maybe I can make some molotov

1396
01:39:13,336 --> 01:39:15,641
cocktails real quick. Maybe.

1397
01:39:15,641 --> 01:39:20,808
MATT: Okay. You gather a couple of bottles of
wine. You, not really being able to read the

1398
01:39:20,808 --> 01:39:24,191
labels, gather what seems to be alcoholic and
functional.

1399
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:25,655
MARISHA: Looks expensive.

1400
01:39:25,655 --> 01:39:26,830
TALIESIN: Looks like molotov.

1401
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:27,796
MARISHA: Yeah.

1402
01:39:27,796 --> 01:39:35,391
MATT: All right. While this is happening, does
anyone want to do anything else here?

1403
01:39:35,391 --> 01:39:42,340
IVAN: I want to roll in the discarded grain that I
then threw up to give me temporary hit points, and

1404
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:44,519
I want to roll in it.

1405
01:39:44,519 --> 01:39:49,453
MATT: Okay. You roll around in it and you feel
like it'll give you sufficient protection against

1406
01:39:49,453 --> 01:39:51,260
a light wind.

1407
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:54,181
MARISHA: Like a dog rolling in his vomit.

1408
01:39:54,181 --> 01:39:57,340
IVAN: Yes, exactly. That's exactly how it's going
down.

1409
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:01,692
MATT: You can hear the footsteps and what sounds
like voices from upstairs. There is a ladder in

1410
01:40:01,692 --> 01:40:05,747
the far edge of this room that leads up to a trap
door, and when the trap door is closed, you can

1411
01:40:05,747 --> 01:40:10,754
hear what sounds like the occasional chuckle,
voices that are muffled through the wood. It

1412
01:40:10,754 --> 01:40:16,923
appears that there is an actual tavern above you
on street level that has a handful of patrons in it.

1413
01:40:16,923 --> 01:40:23,452
IVAN: So, do we escape through the tavern or do we
go back into the caves and see if we can get under

1414
01:40:23,452 --> 01:40:26,933
the godly poopoo place?

1415
01:40:26,933 --> 01:40:31,487
ASHLY: Can I roll a perception to see if there's
any other way out apart from the place with all

1416
01:40:31,487 --> 01:40:33,439
the humans and the place we just came from?

1417
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:34,855
MATT: Sure.

1418
01:40:34,855 --> 01:40:40,147
ASHLY: That's not great. It's a ten.

1419
01:40:40,147 --> 01:40:46,034
MATT: Ten. I mean, there's the path. You can keep
going or there's the tavern.

1420
01:40:46,034 --> 01:40:50,345
ASHLY: Oh right, we can keep going.

1421
01:40:50,345 --> 01:40:53,293
IVAN: We can keep going to find the birch tree.

1422
01:40:53,293 --> 01:40:54,758
PHIL: Church.

1423
01:40:54,758 --> 01:40:56,842
IVAN: Which is where the-- Church, right, the
birch.

1424
01:40:56,842 --> 01:41:00,786
MATT: Which as a note, you guys currently have no
idea where in this city you are. You're just in

1425
01:41:00,786 --> 01:41:02,445
the sewers.

1426
01:41:02,445 --> 01:41:10,362
IVAN: This is fine. This is part of the plan.
Don't even worry about it. Or we could just run

1427
01:41:10,362 --> 01:41:12,387
out into the streets. Goblins.

1428
01:41:12,387 --> 01:41:24,609
PHIL: That sounds decidedly unstealthy. I say we
keep going down until we find poop that seems like

1429
01:41:24,609 --> 01:41:26,294
it's from a blue man.

1430
01:41:26,294 --> 01:41:29,440
MARISHA: I like that. Yeah. For the blue poop.

1431
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,495
IVAN: Browntooth, let's go find the blue poop.

1432
01:41:31,495 --> 01:41:34,968
MARISHA: Let's find the blue poop. Onward.

1433
01:41:34,968 --> 01:41:37,839
IVAN: So we're going to crawl back out through the hole
that we made.

1434
01:41:37,839 --> 01:41:41,377
MARISHA: Maybe there's more cellars like this
too.

1435
01:41:41,377 --> 01:41:42,989
MATT: Okay.

1436
01:41:42,989 --> 01:41:44,696
PHIL: More food.

1437
01:41:44,696 --> 01:41:49,096
MATT: You guys climb outside of the
section of the broken wall and continue down the path.

1438
01:41:49,096 --> 01:41:54,606
IVAN: As we leave, I would like to leave a parting
Flare into the cellar, because burning.

1439
01:41:54,606 --> 01:41:56,210
MATT: (chuckles) Okay.

1440
01:41:56,210 --> 01:42:03,192
IVAN: Because burning. As I leave, I'm like-- on
my way out.

1441
01:42:03,192 --> 01:42:11,028
MATT: Okay. You see the flare begin to slowly
cause an ember to burn at the edge of a burlap

1442
01:42:11,028 --> 01:42:14,448
sack of some spices in the corner.

1443
01:42:14,448 --> 01:42:15,741
MARISHA: Good one.

1444
01:42:15,741 --> 01:42:18,073
IVAN: Yeah! Woo.

1445
01:42:18,073 --> 01:42:22,597
MATT: All right. You guys continue to walk down
this pathway in the sewage system for about

1446
01:42:22,597 --> 01:42:30,483
another 100 or so, 150 feet. It slowly pinches
into about a five-foot-wide tunnel. You guys can

1447
01:42:30,483 --> 01:42:35,698
stand shoulder-to-shoulder, two at a time at your
goblin size to get across. And the little bit of

1448
01:42:35,698 --> 01:42:43,183
water that is coming through here from the rain
runoff from some of the upper grate areas that are

1449
01:42:43,183 --> 01:42:49,120
pouring in, it seems to be running to the edge.
And you stumble a ways ahead before you find out

1450
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:53,863
that there, that drop-off that you noticed, you
come up to it and it is indeed a drop-off. You

1451
01:42:53,863 --> 01:43:02,171
glance down and the walkway you're at ends
abruptly around a large cylindrical cistern-type

1452
01:43:02,171 --> 01:43:10,737
chamber. Probably a good 80 feet across and about
80 feet down, further than your vision can really

1453
01:43:10,737 --> 01:43:13,743
see. You don't see a bottom of it. You see (water
falling).

1454
01:43:13,743 --> 01:43:15,379
IVAN: What does the loogie tell me?

1455
01:43:15,379 --> 01:43:18,743
MATT: You spit out the loogie. Make a perception
check.

1456
01:43:18,743 --> 01:43:21,358
IVAN: Loogie perception check.

1457
01:43:21,358 --> 01:43:27,411
MARISHA: We're all rolling terrible tonight.

1458
01:43:27,411 --> 01:43:33,199
MATT: You get so caught up with the flow of the
loogie that you keep leaning forward further and

1459
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:36,733
further trying to figure it out as your heels lift
up.

1460
01:43:36,733 --> 01:43:37,825
IVAN: Woo!

1461
01:43:37,825 --> 01:43:43,231
MATT: You guys watch as Grizznak suddenly tips
forward and goes over the edge.

1462
01:43:43,231 --> 01:43:44,850
ASHLY: Well, he's dead.

1463
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:48,675
IVAN: Is anyone going to catch me? Because I'm
going to sing my song.

1464
01:43:48,675 --> 01:43:54,856
ASHLY: I can try to catch you. What would that be?
Or would it be acrobatics?

1465
01:43:54,856 --> 01:43:59,422
MATT: This would be a straight up, I would say,
dexterity. Go ahead and roll a dexterity check on

1466
01:43:59,422 --> 01:44:02,182
this one to see if you can be fast enough to
grab.

1467
01:44:02,182 --> 01:44:03,515
TALIESIN: I'll join her in it.

1468
01:44:03,515 --> 01:44:05,370
MARISHA: I'll join. We'll make goblin--

1469
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:07,633
PHIL: This is the last time I save your ass.

1470
01:44:07,633 --> 01:44:08,633
ASHLY: Seven.

1471
01:44:08,633 --> 01:44:15,654
MARISHA: Goblin chain. We're going to goblin chain
this. Everyone loop together.

1472
01:44:15,654 --> 01:44:17,620
PHIL: 21.

1473
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:19,776
TALIESIN: 13.

1474
01:44:19,776 --> 01:44:23,624
MATT: Oh, you're not helping. You're watching.

1475
01:44:23,624 --> 01:44:29,695
MARISHA: No I'm goblin chaining this with them.
Straight dexterity? 20, total.

1476
01:44:29,695 --> 01:44:33,741
MATT: 20, okay. Piglet reaches forward and goes
over, too.

1477
01:44:33,741 --> 01:44:37,721
ASHLY: Oh god. My hubris.

1478
01:44:37,721 --> 01:44:41,670
MATT: As they both begin to tumble over the edge,
you grab and you both slip forward. The three of

1479
01:44:41,670 --> 01:44:46,613
you manage to grab the back of Piglet and pull her
up and slowly, you guys get back up into the

1480
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:54,378
tunnel. No, no, no. Piglet managed to grab the
very back of Grizznak and pull him back up.

1481
01:44:54,378 --> 01:44:58,635
MARISHA: Damn, guys. We're badasses, just like we
practiced. Good work.

1482
01:44:58,635 --> 01:45:01,854
MATT: Grizznak, you're really frustrated because
you swear you were this close to seeing when that

1483
01:45:01,854 --> 01:45:03,457
thing would drop before you got pulled up.

1484
01:45:03,457 --> 01:45:07,495
IVAN: Guys, what's the big deal? I was almost
there. I almost saw it. Oh, hi.

1485
01:45:07,495 --> 01:45:09,642
PHIL: No more saving you.

1486
01:45:09,642 --> 01:45:17,326
ASHLY: I have an alternate plan. What if I throw
one of you across to the other side?

1487
01:45:17,326 --> 01:45:24,916
PHIL: Hmm. I have another alternate alternate
plan. I look to see if there is any way to climb up.

1488
01:45:24,916 --> 01:45:27,500
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

1489
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:33,868
PHIL: Math is killing me. 24.

1490
01:45:33,868 --> 01:45:38,580
MATT: You glance upon the sides of the stonework
on the inside of this giant cylindrical cistern

1491
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:46,784
that leads up to the where all the water's pouring
in from. Glancing about, there are very, very

1492
01:45:46,784 --> 01:45:53,822
sparsely set stones that are slightly more
protruding than the rest. You gather they could be

1493
01:45:53,822 --> 01:46:02,199
leapt from stone to stone, if one is so interested
in being a good climber. So there is a way, yeah.

1494
01:46:02,199 --> 01:46:13,586
ASHLY: Goblin toss. That other thing, that sounds
way boring. Goblin toss. Boring.

1495
01:46:13,586 --> 01:46:15,284
TALIESIN: I volunteer as tribute!

1496
01:46:15,284 --> 01:46:17,512
ASHLY: Yeah! You want me to toss you?

1497
01:46:17,512 --> 01:46:20,372
TALIESIN: I tie the rope to my waist and I tie the
rope to her.

1498
01:46:20,372 --> 01:46:21,831
PHIL: All the way across?

1499
01:46:21,831 --> 01:46:23,050
ASHLY: All the way across.

1500
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:24,804
TALIESIN: I have 50 feet of rope.

1501
01:46:24,804 --> 01:46:28,497
MATT: Mezek ties the rope around. Who gets the
other end of the rope?

1502
01:46:28,497 --> 01:46:29,911
TALIESIN: Give it to Piglet.

1503
01:46:29,911 --> 01:46:32,108
MATT: Okay. Piglet, you have one side of the rope
now.

1504
01:46:32,108 --> 01:46:34,311
ASHLY: I'm going to start swinging him around.

1505
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:38,917
MATT: Okay. Because there isn't a lot of-- Roll a
strength check.

1506
01:46:38,917 --> 01:46:42,461
TALIESIN: I approve of this plan on every level.

1507
01:46:42,461 --> 01:46:43,929
ASHLY: 12.

1508
01:46:43,929 --> 01:46:48,309
MATT: 12. So you swing him around once before you
realize that, because you're up against a wall

1509
01:46:48,309 --> 01:46:56,708
there's not a whole lot of space and (impact) into
the stonework. You take one point of bludgeoning

1510
01:46:56,708 --> 01:47:01,805
damage, hitting the side as he slips down and then
is now dangling and you can pull him back up.

1511
01:47:01,805 --> 01:47:03,581
TALIESIN: All right. Toss--

1512
01:47:03,581 --> 01:47:08,766
MATT: There's a big gap in Mezek's grin as a tooth
is now missing from that.

1513
01:47:08,766 --> 01:47:11,305
ASHLY: It looks good. It suits you.

1514
01:47:11,305 --> 01:47:12,810
TALIESIN: It was hurting already.

1515
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:14,022
PHIL: More space to eat.

1516
01:47:14,022 --> 01:47:17,848
TALIESIN: Yeah. Strawholder. All right.

1517
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,679
ASHLY: All right. Well, that's all my plans.

1518
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:22,218
PHIL: You're not going to throw him across?

1519
01:47:22,218 --> 01:47:25,022
ASHLY: Oh wait. I could toss him across. Is there
something on the other side? Did I make that up?

1520
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:26,788
Is there more path?

1521
01:47:26,788 --> 01:47:30,301
MATT: Looking across the way, you can see there is
another opening, 80 feet across.

1522
01:47:30,301 --> 01:47:32,198
ASHLY: Shall I try to toss him?

1523
01:47:32,198 --> 01:47:34,830
TALIESIN: Well, I only have 50 feet of rope. That
would have gone poorly.

1524
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:36,914
MATT: You can try.

1525
01:47:36,914 --> 01:47:39,455
ASHLY: Do you still volunteer as tribute?

1526
01:47:39,455 --> 01:47:41,750
MARISHA: I volunteer.

1527
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:43,291
ASHLY: You volunteer?

1528
01:47:43,291 --> 01:47:47,691
MARISHA: I think I have a plan. It only works for
me though, but fuck you guys.

1529
01:47:47,691 --> 01:47:49,400
ASHLY: All right, I'm going to toss you.

1530
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:59,679
MARISHA: Wait, first I take out a bottle and I
drink it. And I shrink. I take my Reduce Person vial.

1531
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:08,509
MATT: Extract. Okay. What is normal-sized Snizzler
shrinks down to about half the size now. Voice is

1532
01:48:08,509 --> 01:48:12,550
higher, appearance is ridiculous. You guys now all
can't help but chuckle at this.

1533
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:19,994
MARISHA: Okay. Are you ready to throw me? Let's
try this.

1534
01:48:19,994 --> 01:48:21,255
ASHLY: You're so dumb.

1535
01:48:21,255 --> 01:48:23,567
MARISHA: What are you guys laughing at? What?
Don't-- (garble)

1536
01:48:23,567 --> 01:48:26,345
ASHLY: You're small. You're comparatively smaller
to us now.

1537
01:48:26,345 --> 01:48:32,748
IVAN: I take her little tiny arms and I start
making her dance like a little doll.

1538
01:48:32,748 --> 01:48:34,245
MARISHA: Stop it.

1539
01:48:34,245 --> 01:48:41,457
IVAN: My name's Snizzler. Snizzler, Snizzler,
Snizzler. I like to fly. I like to fly.

1540
01:48:41,457 --> 01:48:43,166
MARISHA: Mom! Mom!

1541
01:48:43,166 --> 01:48:45,986
MATT: Snizzler, you immediately regret this
decision.

1542
01:48:45,986 --> 01:48:48,866
ASHLY: All right, now I'm going to toss you.
Okay.

1543
01:48:48,866 --> 01:48:54,536
IVAN: I'm going to, just for shits and giggles,
I'm going to also cast Breeze.

1544
01:48:54,536 --> 01:48:59,038
ASHLY and MARISHA: 20!

1545
01:48:59,038 --> 01:49:00,665
MATT: A natural 20?

1546
01:49:00,665 --> 01:49:02,353
ASHLY: 23 all together.

1547
01:49:02,353 --> 01:49:05,767
TALIESIN: It's the Golden Snitch, man. Don't fuck
with the Golden Snitch.

1548
01:49:05,767 --> 01:49:17,163
MATT: So you take this tiny goblin, lick your
grimy finger, feel the wind, point Sir Ruth style

1549
01:49:17,163 --> 01:49:32,456
and shotput. Snizzler arcs forward, much farther
than you expected. Overward, you see in the

1550
01:49:32,456 --> 01:49:35,005
distance-- rope not attached, by the way.

1551
01:49:35,005 --> 01:49:37,484
MARISHA: You guys, it's beautiful from up here.

1552
01:49:37,484 --> 01:49:43,372
MATT: Over. It comes up and you can see, you may
or may not be close enough to the ledge, oh god,

1553
01:49:43,372 --> 01:49:49,699
it's right there before you. Go ahead and make an
acrobatics check in the middle of the air to try

1554
01:49:49,699 --> 01:49:52,007
and maneuver yourself in the air to catch--

1555
01:49:52,007 --> 01:49:56,393
MARISHA: Hang on, wait. She rolled the Golden
Snitch. Let me roll my golden. Not, not--

1556
01:49:56,393 --> 01:49:58,342
TALIESIN: I was about to say, that Golden Snitch
never rolls well, though.

1557
01:49:58,342 --> 01:50:01,448
MARISHA: It never rolls well. Wait, this is just a
dexterity?

1558
01:50:01,448 --> 01:50:02,636
IVAN: Acrobatics.

1559
01:50:02,636 --> 01:50:04,486
MARISHA: 12.

1560
01:50:04,486 --> 01:50:05,660
MATT: 12.

1561
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:11,707
ASHLY: Oh no. Wait, is it song time? Is it song time?

1562
01:50:11,707 --> 01:50:13,949
IVAN: Song time. Sing your song.

1563
01:50:13,949 --> 01:50:15,638
MARISHA: What? Am I falling now?

1564
01:50:15,638 --> 01:50:18,414
MATT: It's up to you. If you want to let it go.
You can sing your song and go for a reroll.

1565
01:50:18,414 --> 01:50:26,114
MARISHA: I guess it's song time. As I'm still
soaring, in my tiny voice, I say (sing) Snizzler,

1566
01:50:26,114 --> 01:50:35,757
zazzlers, sizzler, zaz. Eyebrows this goblin once
had. My bombs go boom, they never miss. Hi

1567
01:50:35,757 --> 01:50:39,003
Homeland Security, because now I'm on the
watchlist.

1568
01:50:39,003 --> 01:50:42,271
TALIESIN: It's funny because it's true.

1569
01:50:42,271 --> 01:50:44,175
MARISHA: Yes. Yes, it is.

1570
01:50:44,175 --> 01:50:46,343
MATT: Go ahead and reroll that acrobatics check.

1571
01:50:46,343 --> 01:50:47,749
PHIL: Don't use that die.

1572
01:50:47,749 --> 01:50:49,373
MARISHA: I'll use this one.

1573
01:50:49,373 --> 01:50:51,355
IVAN: Got to get better. Got to get--

1574
01:50:51,355 --> 01:50:57,037
ASHLY: Did it get worse? What is with the
rerolling?

1575
01:50:57,037 --> 01:50:58,105
MARISHA: Ten.

1576
01:50:58,105 --> 01:51:06,327
MATT: So, Piglet. You had this. This isn't your
fault. Stupid bomb goblin can't catch a ledge. But

1577
01:51:06,327 --> 01:51:11,534
you like, you cross your arms and look around,
just so everyone else understands that it wasn't you.

1578
01:51:11,534 --> 01:51:12,959
IVAN: Good try, Piglet.

1579
01:51:12,959 --> 01:51:17,721
MATT: (splashing) Into the water below.

1580
01:51:17,721 --> 01:51:19,748
MARISHA: I hate water.

1581
01:51:19,748 --> 01:51:22,209
PHIL: She really does.

1582
01:51:22,209 --> 01:51:24,572
ASHLY: Hey. He didn't die.

1583
01:51:24,572 --> 01:51:26,733
MATT: I do need you to make a swim check.

1584
01:51:26,733 --> 01:51:39,602
MARISHA: I'm fucking terrible at swimming. Oh god.
Okay. Well, I rolled a 14 and I have a minus four,

1585
01:51:39,602 --> 01:51:41,693
to my swim. So ten.

1586
01:51:41,693 --> 01:51:47,874
MATT: So you're treading water and slowly making
your way across this giant cistern, about 20 feet

1587
01:51:47,874 --> 01:51:54,304
below where they are. You get halfway across,
splashing. You guys see Snizzler trying to make

1588
01:51:54,304 --> 01:51:56,346
her way over to where you guys are.

1589
01:51:56,346 --> 01:51:59,127
IVAN: (laughing) There's water down there.

1590
01:51:59,127 --> 01:52:01,251
MARISHA: Seriously, you guys.

1591
01:52:01,251 --> 01:52:05,236
MATT: Roll another swim check to try and make it
the other half of the way.

1592
01:52:05,236 --> 01:52:07,263
IVAN: Come on, Snizzler.

1593
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:12,036
MARISHA: Oh, that's better. 13.

1594
01:52:12,036 --> 01:52:16,564
MATT: 13. You make your way up to the edge, like
(grunting). You guys can look down now and you can

1595
01:52:16,564 --> 01:52:22,610
just barely see outside of your darkvision here,
you see Snizzler approach and is now treading

1596
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:24,645
water at the bottom of the cistern below you.

1597
01:52:24,645 --> 01:52:26,886
ASHLY: We'll lower the ropes, Snizz.

1598
01:52:26,886 --> 01:52:33,850
MARISHA: Come on. Can I see if I can find purchase
on a little rock? Off to the side, I can hold onto.

1599
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:36,877
MATT: Yeah. You go over and reach over and you
grab a rock and pull onto it and pull your weight

1600
01:52:36,877 --> 01:52:41,775
up and your fingers slip off of it. There is a
slick liquid from general grime.

1601
01:52:41,775 --> 01:52:43,185
IVAN: Grab the rope.

1602
01:52:43,185 --> 01:52:46,231
MARISHA: Come on! Come on.

1603
01:52:46,231 --> 01:52:47,370
TALIESIN: I drop the rope.

1604
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:50,264
MATT: Okay. The rope (thumps) into the water next
to you. You grab onto it and the rest of you guys

1605
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:54,708
slowly pull Snizzler back up onto the
entranceway.

1606
01:52:54,708 --> 01:53:00,775
IVAN: My turn. My turn. I want to be thrown next.
My turn.

1607
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:04,569
TALIESIN: I'm going to look at the ceiling. I want
to see if there is anywhere we can attach the rope

1608
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:06,444
to the ceiling to make a swing.

1609
01:53:06,444 --> 01:53:12,595
MATT: Currently, it is a dome, a smooth stone dome
that then has three openings where the rainwater

1610
01:53:12,595 --> 01:53:15,164
is pouring into currently and filling the bottom
of the cistern.

1611
01:53:15,164 --> 01:53:18,744
ASHLY: So the only way up is basically those
little stones? That we can see.

1612
01:53:18,744 --> 01:53:24,353
IVAN: The only other thing I can think of, taking
my Snizzler hat off for a sec-- er, my Grizznak--

1613
01:53:24,353 --> 01:53:32,013
is I could potentially Mage Hand up the rope. But
I don't think I can tie it, I can just move it up.

1614
01:53:32,013 --> 01:53:37,123
PHIL: You know what? No, I'll climb up and tie the
rope. And everyone else can climb.

1615
01:53:37,123 --> 01:53:38,915
IVAN: We'll catch you if you fall.

1616
01:53:38,915 --> 01:53:44,900
PHIL: Right. That'll happen. I climb up to the
grate, with the rope.

1617
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:47,525
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a climb check.

1618
01:53:47,525 --> 01:53:55,000
PHIL: 12 plus climb. 18.

1619
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,903
MATT: 18. As you pull yourself up (grunting) and
it is a slight curvature, so you're, like, hanging

1620
01:54:01,903 --> 01:54:08,083
and holding onto it, but in true goblin Tom Cruise
fashion, keeping a stern expression on your face.

1621
01:54:08,083 --> 01:54:10,264
PHIL: Well, you know Tom Cruise is a goblin.
That's why he's so small.

1622
01:54:10,264 --> 01:54:12,180
MATT: Makes sense. Hopping on the sofa.

1623
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:15,293
PHIL: (goblin noise) I'm in love. I'm in love. I'm
in love.

1624
01:54:15,293 --> 01:54:22,017
MATT: As you pull yourself up, tiny goblin feet
dangling below, keeping your focus, Browntooth,

1625
01:54:22,017 --> 01:54:28,167
you bring your way across the ceiling, carrying
that rope in your grin. You get up to the edge of

1626
01:54:28,167 --> 01:54:33,698
where the water's currently pouring into the
cistern and it's moving past, I need you to roll

1627
01:54:33,698 --> 01:54:36,519
another climb check to try and keep holding.

1628
01:54:36,519 --> 01:54:38,909
PHIL: Nine.

1629
01:54:38,909 --> 01:54:42,549
MATT: Nine. Your fingers are starting to slip.
You're starting to slip.

1630
01:54:42,549 --> 01:54:47,018
IVAN: Can I cast Open on the grate and see if
it'll maybe lift him up with it open?

1631
01:54:47,018 --> 01:54:49,851
MATT: Yeah. You know what, for a--

1632
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:51,654
IVAN: Do you want me to grab it?

1633
01:54:51,654 --> 01:54:54,842
MATT: Yeah. Let's see if we can. What's the spell?
This is Open?

1634
01:54:54,842 --> 01:54:55,960
IVAN: Open.

1635
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:01,443
ASHLY: I'd just like to take this moment to say
that Browntooth is clearly the coolest goblin of

1636
01:55:01,443 --> 01:55:02,841
all the goblins.

1637
01:55:02,841 --> 01:55:04,066
(laughter)

1638
01:55:04,066 --> 01:55:09,633
ASHLY: He transcends space and time and climbed
a slippery wall with a rope in his mouth.

1639
01:55:09,633 --> 01:55:10,993
PHIL: Almost climbed.

1640
01:55:10,993 --> 01:55:12,579
MARISHA: The rest of us are total degenerates.

1641
01:55:12,579 --> 01:55:15,196
ASHLY: I'm just throwing people, like--

1642
01:55:15,196 --> 01:55:22,082
MATT: Yeah, there's no resistance to it. As you're
slipping, slipping, all of a sudden the grate that

1643
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:30,214
contains the water opens and actually slams into
your side, but you manage to catch onto it. It

1644
01:55:30,214 --> 01:55:36,742
knocks the wind out of you, but you manage to hold
on the edge. You catch your breath and you realize

1645
01:55:36,742 --> 01:55:41,655
this is, first off, holding your weight, and
second, there's a number of cross iron bars that

1646
01:55:41,655 --> 01:55:44,692
are all welded together that would be a good place
probably to tie the rope off.

1647
01:55:44,692 --> 01:55:48,022
PHIL: I think I will tie the rope to the things
that would make a good place to tie the rope.

1648
01:55:48,022 --> 01:55:49,632
IVAN: You're welcome!

1649
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:54,236
PHIL: Yeah, right. I saved your life, you saved
mine-- twice.

1650
01:55:54,236 --> 01:55:58,428
IVAN Well, you know what? Now we've got one left.

1651
01:55:58,428 --> 01:56:00,520
PHIL: One left.

1652
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:07,143
IVAN: Which means I owe you a bird. (sings) Birdy
bird bird bird bird. Bird for you, bird for me.

1653
01:56:07,143 --> 01:56:11,731
Two birds for you and one bird for me. Smash it,
twist it, turn it in a stew. Stick it in your face

1654
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:14,208
and you love-- and I love you.

1655
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:16,068
MARISHA: I love that song.

1656
01:56:16,068 --> 01:56:17,325
PHIL: He's got many songs.

1657
01:56:17,325 --> 01:56:18,681
TALIESIN: Very impressive.

1658
01:56:18,681 --> 01:56:23,812
MATT As you finish tying the rope, helping each
person up, each of you manage to climb, having it

1659
01:56:23,812 --> 01:56:27,987
tossed back. It takes you a while to get going,
but you do manage to--

1660
01:56:27,987 --> 01:56:31,150
PHIL We've now been on this quest for five days.

1661
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:37,801
TALIESIN In my head it's all Henson puppets, and
it's adorable. It's like Fraggle Rock, I'm there.

1662
01:56:37,801 --> 01:56:41,142
(cheering)

1663
01:56:41,142 --> 01:56:45,314
ASHLY: The other goblin crew has already made it,
they've got the stone, they're back. That's what's

1664
01:56:45,314 --> 01:56:48,194
already happened in my head. I'll be disappointed
if that's not what happens.

1665
01:56:48,194 --> 01:56:51,723
MATT: In climbing up the side of the grate,
however, going on the other side, you are now

1666
01:56:51,723 --> 01:56:55,527
fighting against the torrent of water so I need
each of you to make a climb check.

1667
01:56:55,527 --> 01:56:57,575
MARISHA: Oh we're all doing this?

1668
01:56:57,575 --> 01:56:58,648
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

1669
01:56:58,648 --> 01:57:00,664
MATT: You don't have to, you can stay back in the
sewers.

1670
01:57:00,664 --> 01:57:02,965
PHIL: Wait for the fire to come.

1671
01:57:02,965 --> 01:57:04,545
ASHLY: 14.

1672
01:57:04,545 --> 01:57:06,889
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1673
01:57:06,889 --> 01:57:08,958
PHIL: 16.

1674
01:57:08,958 --> 01:57:10,092
TALIESIN: Nine.

1675
01:57:10,092 --> 01:57:12,055
MARISHA: Three?

1676
01:57:12,055 --> 01:57:15,069
MATT; (laughing) What do you have, Grizznak?

1677
01:57:15,069 --> 01:57:16,678
IVAN: Two.

1678
01:57:16,678 --> 01:57:18,734
MATT Two? Okay. So--

1679
01:57:18,734 --> 01:57:24,151
PHIL: Who do we have to save now?

1680
01:57:24,151 --> 01:57:33,141
MATT: We'll say for the sake of brevity here, an
additional hour or so is spent perpetually

1681
01:57:33,141 --> 01:57:38,238
retrieving your allies who keep getting all the
way up and then (splash) right into the water. But

1682
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:43,806
you have to admire the tenacity.

1683
01:57:43,806 --> 01:57:46,936
TALIESIN: I drink everything in my flask at this
point.

1684
01:57:46,936 --> 01:57:49,391
MATT: Okay, so you get your Ki point going.

1685
01:57:49,391 --> 01:57:50,965
TALIESIN: I've got to keep drinking.

1686
01:57:50,965 --> 01:57:56,041
MATT: Eventually you guys make your way up past
the flowing of water, which has slowed now, and

1687
01:57:56,041 --> 01:57:58,728
that's probably how you're able to do it.

1688
01:57:58,728 --> 01:58:01,510
TALIESIN: Someone upstairs finally jiggled the
toilet.

1689
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:09,672
MATT: Yeah. You make your way up into an upper
sewage system, and you guys crawl through what is

1690
01:58:09,672 --> 01:58:14,710
a much smaller series of pipes, to the point where
you as goblins still have to crawl to make your

1691
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:19,748
way through. The sludge is thicker here and what
little bit of rain is pouring through you manage

1692
01:58:19,748 --> 01:58:27,056
to keep between your arms and legs. Eventually you
find your way into the bottom of some sort of a

1693
01:58:27,056 --> 01:58:31,921
chamber that is filled with apparently human
waste.

1694
01:58:31,921 --> 01:58:33,150
TALIESIN: Yes.

1695
01:58:33,150 --> 01:58:38,006
ASHLY: The blue poop has to be here.

1696
01:58:38,006 --> 01:58:46,555
MARISHA: I take the poop and I start making a ball
out of it and I light it to see how flammable it is.

1697
01:58:46,555 --> 01:58:47,796
MATT: Okay.

1698
01:58:47,796 --> 01:58:50,422
IVAN: This is totally logical.

1699
01:58:50,422 --> 01:58:53,467
PHIL: If it were church people, they drink a lot,
so it should light up.

1700
01:58:53,467 --> 01:59:01,772
MATT: Like the finest of candles, it does catch
fire and begins to burn slowly. It's not dry

1701
01:59:01,772 --> 01:59:05,346
enough to catch-- we're having this conversation.

1702
01:59:05,346 --> 01:59:08,506
TALIESIN: No, I'm really excited that this is a
thing that's happening right now.

1703
01:59:08,506 --> 01:59:13,808
MATT: It would need to be suitably dried out to
work as proper fuel, but--

1704
01:59:13,808 --> 01:59:21,112
MARISHA: Definitely lots of alcohol, lots of
drugs, yeah. I start packaging up some of the poop.

1705
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:22,155
MATT: All right.

1706
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:25,078
PHIL: I look for any sort of egress.

1707
01:59:25,078 --> 01:59:27,109
MATT: Make a perception check.

1708
01:59:27,109 --> 01:59:28,170
IVAN: Same.

1709
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:30,937
ASHLY: Why not, I'll do it too.

1710
01:59:30,937 --> 01:59:32,335
IVAN: 16.

1711
01:59:32,335 --> 01:59:33,525
PHIL: Eight.

1712
01:59:33,525 --> 01:59:34,654
ASHLY: 18.

1713
01:59:34,654 --> 01:59:41,414
MATT: All right. While you're collecting your
filthy prize, both Piglet and Grizznek, you guys

1714
01:59:41,414 --> 01:59:49,290
look up and notice that there is a wooden or stone
ceiling, but a singular opening above you. Like a

1715
01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:50,697
circular hole.

1716
01:59:50,697 --> 01:59:55,704
IVAN: First, I would like to listen to see if
there's any stinky, stupid humans upstairs.

1717
01:59:55,704 --> 01:59:58,750
MATT: Make a perception check.

1718
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:03,056
IVAN: (singing) Stinky stupid humans. Eight.

1719
02:00:03,056 --> 02:00:06,051
PHIL: I love that game. Stinky stupid humans!

1720
02:00:06,051 --> 02:00:11,703
IVAN: They're so dumb. Stinky stupid humans, but
they're fun-- to kill!

1721
02:00:11,703 --> 02:00:19,889
MATT: You listen and you hear the muffled noises
of conversation as well. It sounds like there are

1722
02:00:19,889 --> 02:00:26,144
a few different voices, though they're behind a
couple of walls from where you are.

1723
02:00:26,144 --> 02:00:27,469
IVAN: So they're not straight above us?

1724
02:00:27,469 --> 02:00:28,491
MATT: No.

1725
02:00:28,491 --> 02:00:32,538
IVAN: I'm going to cast Open again on that
opening.

1726
02:00:32,538 --> 02:00:35,538
MATT: Okay. You cast Open. The opening is open.

1727
02:00:35,538 --> 02:00:37,242
(laughter)

1728
02:00:37,242 --> 02:00:39,045
MATT: So the spell is a success!

1729
02:00:39,045 --> 02:00:42,715
IVAN: Yes! I will climb up through the poop
chute.

1730
02:00:42,715 --> 02:00:49,557
MATT: As you pull yourself up out of it, in a
wonderful medieval version of the Ghoulies VHS

1731
02:00:49,557 --> 02:00:51,836
cover, you pull yourself out from--

1732
02:00:51,836 --> 02:00:55,030
TALIESIN: Wow, we went back.

1733
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:59,905
MATT: Oh man, I couldn't go near toilets for years
because of that movie cover at the VHS store.

1734
02:00:59,905 --> 02:01:04,178
IVAN: I stick my head up and I look through the
toilet seat and then I go (blows nose) and knock a

1735
02:01:04,178 --> 02:01:06,104
huge chunk of poop out of my nostril.

1736
02:01:06,104 --> 02:01:09,571
MATT: There you go. Glancing ahead, your Open
spell missed, but did hit the front of the

1737
02:01:09,571 --> 02:01:17,671
outhouse which has currently swung open in the
mid-day, facing the window leading into the tavern

1738
02:01:17,671 --> 02:01:20,667
that you guys nearly entered beforehand.

1739
02:01:20,667 --> 02:01:22,372
IVAN: Oh. Close.

1740
02:01:22,372 --> 02:01:29,186
MATT: Closes shut. However, it does appear to be
nestled in an alleyway on the outside of it. It's

1741
02:01:29,186 --> 02:01:32,664
a very thin opening. You didn't see any people
actually in the alley. You saw the outside of a

1742
02:01:32,664 --> 02:01:34,819
window and a street thoroughfare.

1743
02:01:34,819 --> 02:01:36,642
IVAN: Mmm.

1744
02:01:36,642 --> 02:01:37,821
PHIL: Where are we?

1745
02:01:37,821 --> 02:01:45,418
IVAN: We're outside now. We seem to be in what the
humans use to get rid of all their precious waste.

1746
02:01:45,418 --> 02:01:47,018
TALIESIN: We're inside an outhouse?

1747
02:01:47,018 --> 02:01:50,918
PHIL: That sounds sort of oxymoronic.

1748
02:01:50,918 --> 02:01:57,122
IVAN: We're in one of those redundant human cubes
in which humans go to poop inside of instead of

1749
02:01:57,122 --> 02:02:00,202
doing it where they sleep, which is way more
practical.

1750
02:02:00,202 --> 02:02:07,701
ASHLY: Wait, guys, those church things-- isn't
there like a symbol that people use, like a circle

1751
02:02:07,701 --> 02:02:09,192
or like--?

1752
02:02:09,192 --> 02:02:13,530
IVAN: Well, I say we get Browntooth up here and he
can go scout it out. Right, Browntooth?

1753
02:02:13,530 --> 02:02:21,246
PHIL: If it keeps you from blowing things up, and
you setting anything on fire. Right, I climb up

1754
02:02:21,246 --> 02:02:28,901
and go out the outhouse to stealthily move into the
street.

1755
02:02:28,901 --> 02:02:32,205
MATT: All righty. So, as you--

1756
02:02:32,205 --> 02:02:37,196
IVAN: Wait, wait, wait. I'm also going to cast
Penumbra on him.

1757
02:02:37,196 --> 02:02:38,327
MATT: Okay.

1758
02:02:38,327 --> 02:02:41,916
IVAN: So, Penumbra, it basically puts a permanent
shadow on him.

1759
02:02:41,916 --> 02:02:45,279
PHIL: Oh. I thought it gave me a number from
before.

1760
02:02:45,279 --> 02:02:47,065
(laughs)

1761
02:02:47,065 --> 02:02:49,059
MATT: Go ahead and roll a stealth check, if you
could.

1762
02:02:49,059 --> 02:02:56,505
IVAN: Makes it so that even light spells make him
still look like he's covered in shadow.

1763
02:02:56,505 --> 02:02:58,705
PHIL: 32.

1764
02:02:58,765 --> 02:03:01,875
MATT: All right. As you stumble into the shady
alley, looking about, you glance over the side of

1765
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:05,505
the window real fast into the tavern, and you do
see there are probably a dozen patrons in there.

1766
02:03:05,505 --> 02:03:11,783
Some drinks being served, a guard at the door on
the inside. However, looking to your left, there

1767
02:03:11,783 --> 02:03:16,058
the alleyway spills out into a main street
thoroughfare, and you can see people walking by,

1768
02:03:16,058 --> 02:03:23,483
families with children. There's a general air of
jovial energy to it, and some people are wearing

1769
02:03:23,483 --> 02:03:29,149
flower crowns on their heads. You can see
carts being put along the street. Seems like the

1770
02:03:29,149 --> 02:03:34,439
festival you were told of, this terrible, human
festival seems to be in full swing. Go ahead and

1771
02:03:34,439 --> 02:03:36,725
make a survival check.

1772
02:03:36,725 --> 02:03:39,058
PHIL: 16.

1773
02:03:39,058 --> 02:03:46,732
MATT: You come out to the edge of the alleyway,
glance about. First thing you notice is the sun in

1774
02:03:46,732 --> 02:03:52,101
the sky. You were like "eh, it's probably
mid-day-ish". No, it's pushing toward sunset now.

1775
02:03:52,101 --> 02:03:54,833
You probably have another hour of sunlight. So
you don't know how much longer this festival's

1776
02:03:54,833 --> 02:03:59,219
going to be going. You spent quite a while getting
here and wandering the sewers.

1777
02:03:59,219 --> 02:04:01,861
IVAN: As per typical goblin fashion.

1778
02:04:01,861 --> 02:04:10,928
MATT: Indeed. However, you notice that everyone is
walking a certain direction. And, one, there are a

1779
02:04:10,928 --> 02:04:21,727
number of carts that are going by. There are
currently unmanned, closed carts that would be

1780
02:04:21,727 --> 02:04:28,996
used to sell fruit and fish. This being a port
town, fish is a big export here. And the alleyways

1781
02:04:28,996 --> 02:04:33,209
that you came out of? There is a second alleyway
that offshoots from where the outhouse is that

1782
02:04:33,209 --> 02:04:38,444
goes between the buildings off the main
thoroughfare. This is what you're able to gauge in

1783
02:04:38,444 --> 02:04:39,901
your time out here.

1784
02:04:39,901 --> 02:04:51,216
PHIL: I go back and tell them what I've seen. So
everybody's going that way.

1785
02:04:51,216 --> 02:04:53,643
IVAN: We should probably go--

1786
02:04:53,643 --> 02:04:57,461
ALL: That way?

1787
02:04:57,461 --> 02:04:59,084
IVAN: That way.

1788
02:04:59,084 --> 02:05:00,161
ASHLY: That way!

1789
02:05:00,161 --> 02:05:07,002
MARISHA: Maybe if we get on each others' shoulders
with a coat, we'll look like peoples!

1790
02:05:07,002 --> 02:05:14,733
ASHLY: I want do a perception roll for a big coat.
14.

1791
02:05:14,733 --> 02:05:20,670
MATT: You glance over the window and look inside.
One of the bar patrons, sitting by the bar, is

1792
02:05:20,670 --> 02:05:31,296
this rotund-looking gentleman in his late 40s.
Balding hair, a double chin, leaned forward on the

1793
02:05:31,296 --> 02:05:35,975
bar, looking like he's ready to pass out from the
amount of alcohol he's been drinking. He is in the

1794
02:05:35,975 --> 02:05:39,216
inside of the tavern. He has a very long coat that
drapes past the bar.

1795
02:05:39,216 --> 02:05:43,024
ASHLY: We got to do it! There's no alternative!

1796
02:05:43,024 --> 02:05:49,599
PHIL: There is an alternative! There's the little
alleyway!

1797
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:55,031
ASHLY: No alternative! This is what we're doing.
How many patrons are there? Do I get to know from

1798
02:05:55,031 --> 02:05:56,293
my perception check?

1799
02:05:56,293 --> 02:05:59,562
MATT: Glancing in there, you see probably ten
patrons altogether.

1800
02:05:59,562 --> 02:06:05,125
MARISHA: I look around. Do I see anything that
looks like a children's clothing store? Maybe two

1801
02:06:05,125 --> 02:06:07,976
of us can be a child and three of us can be an
adult.

1802
02:06:07,976 --> 02:06:12,021
IVAN: If each one of us is a leg, and we're three
goblins tall, that's six feet.

1803
02:06:12,021 --> 02:06:14,053
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, no, you're right, Grizz.

1804
02:06:14,053 --> 02:06:18,125
PHIL: Look for a cow costume. Perception check for
a cow costume.

1805
02:06:18,125 --> 02:06:21,726
IVAN: I'll cast Penumbra on you, so at least
you'll be in shadow.

1806
02:06:21,726 --> 02:06:27,151
ASHLY: And then I could stealth. Well, your
stealth is insane, actually. He has +20 stealth.

1807
02:06:27,151 --> 02:06:30,797
TALIESIN: I've got very high stealth, too, so I'm
going to come in with this.

1808
02:06:30,797 --> 02:06:33,992
ASHLY: You guys should go in and get the coat!
I'll go in, too!

1809
02:06:33,992 --> 02:06:36,390
TALIESIN: We're going to sneak in to get the
coat.

1810
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:38,464
MARISHA: I'll stand guard and watch outside the
window.

1811
02:06:38,464 --> 02:06:40,741
PHIL: I still have my Penumbra, right?

1812
02:06:40,741 --> 02:06:41,793
IVAN: Penumbra.

1813
02:06:41,793 --> 02:06:48,662
MATT: You do not have Penumbra because he cast it
on her, right? Or is it a once at a time thing, or

1814
02:06:48,662 --> 02:06:50,518
can you do multiple people?

1815
02:06:50,518 --> 02:06:52,988
IVAN: That's a good question. Shit. It's in the
Ultimate Magic book.

1816
02:06:52,988 --> 02:06:56,840
MATT: We'll say, for the time being, it affects
both of you. It's fine. Using the shadows around

1817
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:01,191
you, it's getting late. The angle of the sun,
shadows are not too hard to find. Roll stealth

1818
02:07:01,191 --> 02:07:07,163
checks, all three of you, as you make your way
along the side, darting between barrels and trying

1819
02:07:07,163 --> 02:07:11,794
to find a way into the tavern from the window,
other than the front door.

1820
02:07:11,794 --> 02:07:12,908
ASHLY: 30.

1821
02:07:12,908 --> 02:07:14,156
TALIESIN: 31.

1822
02:07:14,156 --> 02:07:15,241
PHIL: 33.

1823
02:07:15,241 --> 02:07:27,040
MATT: Woo! You guys duck behind every single
possible piece of discarded material, empty crates

1824
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:32,200
and boxes, barrels that are available. You jump at
certain times, following the lead of Browntooth.

1825
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:38,449
You manage to find your way through the
thoroughfare to an entrance to the kitchen on the

1826
02:07:38,449 --> 02:07:42,839
side of this tavern. The door is partially ajar.
You look in and there is one person manning the

1827
02:07:42,839 --> 02:07:49,258
kitchen. You see this poor, older woman, who is in
the process of running around with four things

1828
02:07:49,258 --> 02:07:57,671
burning and is like, "There's too many! I hate
festivals! Coming!" She's not paying attention to

1829
02:07:57,671 --> 02:07:59,204
the door right now.

1830
02:07:59,204 --> 02:08:00,617
ASHLY: So we could stealth by her, too?

1831
02:08:00,617 --> 02:08:01,454
MATT: You could try.

1832
02:08:01,454 --> 02:08:03,050
PHIL: Or we could kill her.

1833
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:07,671
ASHLY: Look, I know I'm a goblin and I love human
blood, but she looks like she's trying her best,

1834
02:08:07,671 --> 02:08:08,944
you know?

1835
02:08:08,944 --> 02:08:13,069
MATT: She seems largely distracted. You guys, with
your current stealth, not an issue. You make your

1836
02:08:13,069 --> 02:08:19,294
way through the kitchen unnoticed. You make your
way into the tavern proper. You can see a handful

1837
02:08:19,294 --> 02:08:23,060
of patrons around a table playing cards, talking to
each other. You hear a couple of them. One

1838
02:08:23,060 --> 02:08:28,636
person's like, "Stupid tradition. I'm just going
to stay here and drink until I care." Takes a big

1839
02:08:28,636 --> 02:08:36,093
old sip. Somebody on the other side of the table
goes, "Speeches every year, speeches! Father

1840
02:08:36,093 --> 02:08:43,495
"Zantas has shown that religion has no sense of
brevity!" You see this other guy at the far end

1841
02:08:43,495 --> 02:08:49,425
table gets up, "And what about you, Zed?" And
slaps the shoulder of the guy who has the large

1842
02:08:49,425 --> 02:08:55,194
coat on. He's leaning forward and goes, "At least
the meals were good. I'm probably going to skip

1843
02:08:55,194 --> 02:09:05,349
"out on the consecration. I've no stomach for
prayer these days." He's face down on the bar

1844
02:09:05,349 --> 02:09:11,379
right there. "Oh, Zed! That'll be me in an hour."
He goes and sits down at the table. There's just

1845
02:09:11,379 --> 02:09:16,138
the barkeep at the bar who's close. Everyone else
is at the table now at the card game and Zed is

1846
02:09:16,138 --> 02:09:18,229
passed out at the bar. What are you going to do?

1847
02:09:18,229 --> 02:09:21,954
ASHLY: Guys, what was the name of that dude we
were supposed to find?

1848
02:09:21,954 --> 02:09:27,121
PHIL: Something with a 'Z,' with two parts. It's
not him.

1849
02:09:27,121 --> 02:09:28,554
ASHLY: It's not him?

1850
02:09:28,554 --> 02:09:29,965
PHIL: He's not wearing blue.

1851
02:09:29,965 --> 02:09:32,984
MATT: No, he's not wearing blue. He's wearing a
dark, muddy brown color.

1852
02:09:32,984 --> 02:09:34,868
ASHLY: Let's steal his coat!

1853
02:09:34,868 --> 02:09:39,328
MATT: All right. The three of you guys going into
this tavern area.

1854
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:41,269
Go ahead and roll stealth again.

1855
02:09:41,269 --> 02:09:44,835
ASHLY: 20.

1856
02:09:44,835 --> 02:09:48,611
MATT: Cannot roll perception for NPCs today at
all.

1857
02:09:48,611 --> 02:09:49,936
PHIL: 34.

1858
02:09:49,936 --> 02:09:51,033
TALIESIN: 37.

1859
02:09:51,033 --> 02:09:55,794
MATT: You guys dart under one table, wait for a
moment, the barmaid walks by, dart under another

1860
02:09:55,794 --> 02:10:01,456
table. You're chaining your way across this room
between these men. Eventually, finding your way

1861
02:10:01,456 --> 02:10:08,183
right to the outside of this passed-out Zed whose
arm drifts and hangs loosely to his side. His body

1862
02:10:08,183 --> 02:10:13,737
is half against the bar and is a good two minutes
from slumping directly onto the ground

1863
02:10:13,737 --> 02:10:15,250
and off his stool.

1864
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:16,955
ASHLY: How do we steal it?

1865
02:10:16,955 --> 02:10:18,792
PHIL: Should we wait for him to slump?

1866
02:10:18,792 --> 02:10:25,464
MATT: The barkeep is like, "You okay, Zed?" Pokes
him a little bit.

1867
02:10:25,464 --> 02:10:27,802
TALIESIN: (heavy sigh)

1868
02:10:27,802 --> 02:10:31,523
MATT: "He's all right." Goes back to cleaning a
mug.

1869
02:10:31,523 --> 02:10:39,610
ASHLY: Maybe one of us should distract the barkeep
while the other two grab the coat. Make noise in

1870
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:41,098
the corner or something.

1871
02:10:41,098 --> 02:10:43,611
IVAN: We're still outside, right?

1872
02:10:43,611 --> 02:10:44,980
MATT: Yeah, you're just waiting.

1873
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:49,612
IVAN: I keep casting Open and Close on the
outhouse door.

1874
02:10:49,612 --> 02:10:52,443
MATT: (creaking) (slamming)

1875
02:10:52,443 --> 02:10:57,663
TALIESIN: Does Zed have anything on his person
other than a coat?

1876
02:10:57,663 --> 02:11:00,752
MATT: You can only see the coat on him right now
because it's a long trench coat.

1877
02:11:00,752 --> 02:11:02,799
PHIL: We'll throw something to the other side of
the bar.

1878
02:11:02,799 --> 02:11:04,385
ASHLY: Break some glasses. Really distract them.

1879
02:11:04,385 --> 02:11:05,400
MATT: What do you throw?

1880
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:11,342
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab one of my goblin jag
stars and I'm going to pop one of the bottles on

1881
02:11:11,342 --> 02:11:12,985
the shelf. I assume there's a shelf of bottles.

1882
02:11:12,985 --> 02:11:14,197
MATT: There is a shelf of bottles.

1883
02:11:14,197 --> 02:11:16,433
TALIESIN: I'm going to pop one on the opposite
side of us to try and knock it over.

1884
02:11:16,433 --> 02:11:19,905
MATT: Mezek, you pull out your goblin jag star,
which is essentially the equivalent of a

1885
02:11:19,905 --> 02:11:26,228
shuriken, but it's carved out of pieces of odd,
rusted metal that had been tied together. It's

1886
02:11:26,228 --> 02:11:33,251
more of a cluster of broken whatever you found
from a wagon wheel that was busted weeks ago, but you throw

1887
02:11:33,251 --> 02:11:36,128
it as a ranged weapon. Roll an attack.

1888
02:11:36,128 --> 02:11:40,245
TALIESIN: That's 20.

1889
02:11:40,245 --> 02:11:47,649
MATT: 20. A bottle shatters and sprays across the
back of the barkeep who's like, "Hey, what the

1890
02:11:47,649 --> 02:11:48,766
"hell is that?!"

1891
02:11:48,766 --> 02:11:50,140
TALIESIN: Grab it!

1892
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:57,025
MATT: He seems currently distracted. The three of
you together make sleight of hand checks right now

1893
02:11:57,025 --> 02:11:59,780
as you rush up to try and pull this off.

1894
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:01,758
TALIESIN: Where's sleight of hand?

1895
02:12:01,758 --> 02:12:03,747
MATT: This is probably me, sorry.

1896
02:12:03,747 --> 02:12:06,114
IVAN: Should be under sense motive.

1897
02:12:06,114 --> 02:12:07,677
TALIESIN: We don't have it.

1898
02:12:07,677 --> 02:12:08,725
PHIL: I have it.

1899
02:12:08,725 --> 02:12:13,713
MATT: So you guys aren't trained in it, so this
is going to be a basic roll, adding your dexterity

1900
02:12:13,713 --> 02:12:14,828
modifier.

1901
02:12:14,828 --> 02:12:16,747
ASHLY: So 11, then.

1902
02:12:16,747 --> 02:12:18,011
PHIL: 28.

1903
02:12:18,011 --> 02:12:19,093
TALIESIN: 19.

1904
02:12:19,093 --> 02:12:24,033
MATT: Okay, you're all above a ten with two high
rolls, that's good. You all leap up real fast,

1905
02:12:24,033 --> 02:12:28,315
grab his coat, and pull it off of him before
anyone seems to notice.

1906
02:12:28,315 --> 02:12:31,775
TALIESIN: I want to see if he's got anything on
his belt like a pouch or anything like that.

1907
02:12:31,775 --> 02:12:35,276
MATT: You glance, and there is a belt pouch
there.

1908
02:12:35,276 --> 02:12:37,812
TALIESIN: I want to make a stab at grabbing and
ripping it off.

1909
02:12:37,812 --> 02:12:38,961
ASHLY: Don't get greedy!

1910
02:12:38,961 --> 02:12:40,366
MATT: Roll another sleight of hand check.

1911
02:12:40,366 --> 02:12:42,179
IVAN: We're goblins; of course be greedy!

1912
02:12:42,179 --> 02:12:43,322
TALIESIN: What am I rolling?

1913
02:12:43,322 --> 02:12:44,463
MATT: This is another sleight of hand.

1914
02:12:44,463 --> 02:12:45,436
TALIESIN: 15.

1915
02:12:45,436 --> 02:12:50,882
MATT: 15. Okay! You snatch it and all of a sudden
you hear a voice from the front door go, "Hey,

1916
02:12:50,882 --> 02:12:58,246
"what's that? I saw something! Is someone trying to
steal from Zed?!" You hear footsteps as somebody

1917
02:12:58,246 --> 02:13:00,311
begins walking over to where he was right now.

1918
02:13:00,311 --> 02:13:02,651
ASHLY: Go! We run?

1919
02:13:02,651 --> 02:13:05,940
MATT: You guys run? Make stealth checks, guys.

1920
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:08,618
ASHLY: We have the coat, though, right?

1921
02:13:08,618 --> 02:13:10,176
MATT: You have the coat with you, yeah.

1922
02:13:10,176 --> 02:13:11,680
ASHLY: Oh no!

1923
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:12,983
PHIL: 40.

1924
02:13:12,983 --> 02:13:14,106
ASHLY: 15.

1925
02:13:14,106 --> 02:13:18,473
TALIESIN: 34.

1926
02:13:18,473 --> 02:13:23,313
MATT: Okay, you guys run. As you're running,
Piglet, you're running behind them hanging on the

1927
02:13:23,313 --> 02:13:27,972
back of the coat and you slam your head at the
bottom of the table, putting a big old knot on it.

1928
02:13:27,972 --> 02:13:33,090
It happens to be the table where the card game was
being played. All the cards go (crashing), all the

1929
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:38,645
coins scatter in the air. The guys go, "Whoa what
the hell is that?!" And they see as this coat

1930
02:13:38,645 --> 02:13:46,242
scampers off into the kitchen on its own. You guys
hear voices go, "Did you see that?!" "It went in

1931
02:13:46,242 --> 02:13:50,891
"the kitchen, come on!" You hear the sound of
chairs scooting as all of a sudden people are

1932
02:13:50,891 --> 02:13:53,342
beginning to stand up and rush towards the kitchen
after you.

1933
02:13:53,342 --> 02:13:57,472
TALIESIN: While we're running, I'm going to take my
jar of puke and pour it out on the ground behind

1934
02:13:57,472 --> 02:13:59,023
us like a mud slick.

1935
02:13:59,023 --> 02:14:01,115
ASHLY: I have puke, too!

1936
02:14:01,115 --> 02:14:07,809
MATT: You're holding the knot on your head, you
pull the jar, pour it out, and spill this slick

1937
02:14:07,809 --> 02:14:15,242
mass of goblin vomit and whatever else liquid you
put inside there. As you dart through the kitchen,

1938
02:14:15,242 --> 02:14:23,501
the cook goes, "Your food's ready! What the--?!"
And sees you guys dart out the door as the crowd

1939
02:14:23,501 --> 02:14:33,367
comes in and two of them (yell) and fall on their
backs immediately there. A third man steps over

1940
02:14:33,367 --> 02:14:39,056
and follows you into the alleyway. The cook's
like, "You can't be in here! What are you doing?!"

1941
02:14:39,056 --> 02:14:43,607
As the door slams, you guys make your way into the
alley. You see the three of them rush out holding

1942
02:14:43,607 --> 02:14:45,037
the coat.

1943
02:14:45,037 --> 02:14:46,873
MARISHA: What's going on?

1944
02:14:46,873 --> 02:14:50,158
(frantic yelling)

1945
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:56,878
MARISHA: I'm so glad I planned for this. And I go,
go guys. Smoke bomb!

1946
02:14:56,878 --> 02:15:05,897
MATT: As the door opens again, you see this
breastplate-adorned guard of the city who is

1947
02:15:05,897 --> 02:15:11,979
essentially the bouncer of this place, rushes out,
blade drawn, helmet half-cocked on his face where

1948
02:15:11,979 --> 02:15:17,609
it doesn't fit right and one eye looks higher than
the other, and he goes, "You!" (explosion) As

1949
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:21,497
smoke fills this entire alleyway, he begins
coughing.

1950
02:15:21,497 --> 02:15:25,759
MARISHA: Before the cloud gets too thick, I go--
and run.

1951
02:15:25,759 --> 02:15:29,326
ASHLY: We should go in the outhouse and assemble
our Mary Kate and Ashley situation.

1952
02:15:29,326 --> 02:15:30,541
MARISHA: Okay, let's do it!

1953
02:15:30,541 --> 02:15:33,017
IVAN: We should probably not do it in the
outhouse.

1954
02:15:33,017 --> 02:15:36,880
TALIESIN: We can run all the way around the
alleyway from this. Let's get down the alley.

1955
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:41,692
MATT: You guys rush out of the alleyway, you get
out of the fog, you manage to dart off to the side

1956
02:15:41,692 --> 02:15:46,394
and wait a little bit. You hear that guard wander
off and start shouting, and vanishes in the

1957
02:15:46,394 --> 02:15:49,432
distance. After a few moments of waiting, you're
pretty certain he hasn't been able to keep up with

1958
02:15:49,432 --> 02:15:52,883
your trail because you're <i>that stealthy.</i> Are you
going to do this?

1959
02:15:52,883 --> 02:15:54,465
ASHLY: Yeah! Who wants to be the head?

1960
02:15:54,465 --> 02:15:55,926
IVAN: That's the important one.

1961
02:15:55,926 --> 02:15:58,671
PHIL: We all have goblin heads.

1962
02:15:58,671 --> 02:16:01,478
IVAN: I have a 17 charisma.

1963
02:16:01,478 --> 02:16:03,483
MARISHA: I don't like talking to people.

1964
02:16:03,483 --> 02:16:06,187
ASHLY: Whoever has the highest charisma should
definitely be the head.

1965
02:16:06,187 --> 02:16:08,177
IVAN: Grizznak the Great will be the head!

1966
02:16:08,177 --> 02:16:11,490
MATT: This is the best goblin Voltron ever!

1967
02:16:11,490 --> 02:16:18,605
IVAN: Hello, fellow human! Aren't you having a
wonderful human day today?

1968
02:16:18,605 --> 02:16:21,161
PHIL: You guys have the high strength.

1969
02:16:21,161 --> 02:16:26,297
TALIESIN: Well, we've got the high dex. You should
be the middle, so we'll be the legs.

1970
02:16:26,297 --> 02:16:32,295
IVAN: You form the torso. I will form the head and
together we shall be Goblon!

1971
02:16:32,295 --> 02:16:35,992
MARISHA: I've been doing a lot of crunches, so I
feel pretty good about being the core.

1972
02:16:35,992 --> 02:16:37,342
TALIESIN: What's in the pouch?

1973
02:16:37,342 --> 02:16:41,769
MATT: In the pouch you find eight gold pieces, a
small snuff box.

1974
02:16:41,769 --> 02:16:44,929
TALIESIN: Ooh! I eat all the snuff.

1975
02:16:44,929 --> 02:16:45,980
MATT: Okay!

1976
02:16:45,980 --> 02:16:47,733
PHIL: You're flying!

1977
02:16:47,733 --> 02:16:51,412
MARISHA: What did you eat?!

1978
02:16:51,412 --> 02:16:54,766
MATT: Roll a will saving throw.

1979
02:16:54,766 --> 02:17:00,483
TALIESIN: Where's my will saving throw? There it
is. 16.

1980
02:17:00,483 --> 02:17:06,473
MATT: 16. Okay. The world gets a little funny for
a bit, and you feel exhilarated, though a little

1981
02:17:06,473 --> 02:17:14,761
unfocused. What normally is the goblin ADHD is now
in hyperdrive. You're looking everywhere. We have

1982
02:17:14,761 --> 02:17:16,516
Grizznak as the head.

1983
02:17:16,516 --> 02:17:17,754
IVAN: Grizznak forms the head!

1984
02:17:17,754 --> 02:17:18,946
PHIL: We are the middle.

1985
02:17:18,946 --> 02:17:20,011
MATT: You guys are the middle.

1986
02:17:20,011 --> 02:17:21,239
MARISHA and TALIESIN: We're the legs.

1987
02:17:21,239 --> 02:17:25,492
MATT: With that, you stand up, coat goes on,
snapping it shut.

1988
02:17:25,492 --> 02:17:28,634
ASHLY: I give Grizznak my pretty hat.

1989
02:17:28,634 --> 02:17:35,277
IVAN: Okay. I actually have a goblin's wizard's
hat.

1990
02:17:35,277 --> 02:17:38,443
ASHLY: Can you put it on top to humor me?

1991
02:17:38,443 --> 02:17:43,376
IVAN: Why don't you put it under one of our arms
so it looks like we're carrying a helmet?

1992
02:17:43,376 --> 02:17:45,248
ASHLY: All right. Fair enough.

1993
02:17:45,248 --> 02:17:47,979
IVAN: I'll probably get away more with the wizard
hat.

1994
02:17:47,979 --> 02:17:49,767
PHIL: Oh, you think?

1995
02:17:49,767 --> 02:17:52,861
MATT: So, where are you guys going?

1996
02:17:52,861 --> 02:17:58,652
PHIL: We're going towards where the people were
going. Was the alleyway

1997
02:17:58,652 --> 02:18:00,402
parallel to the main street?

1998
02:18:00,402 --> 02:18:02,299
MATT: It was, yeah. You follow that.

1999
02:18:02,299 --> 02:18:03,578
PHIL: Head down the alleyway.

2000
02:18:03,578 --> 02:18:06,119
MATT: Great. The sky has cleared, by the way.

2001
02:18:06,119 --> 02:18:07,487
PHIL: Like Vincent D'onofrio.

2002
02:18:07,487 --> 02:18:09,533
MARISHA: Yes, like Men in Black.

2003
02:18:09,533 --> 02:18:17,512
MATT: Okay, so! (laughs) I'm so happy right now.

2004
02:18:17,512 --> 02:18:20,231
IVAN: Hello!

2005
02:18:20,231 --> 02:18:21,748
PHIL: Morning!

2006
02:18:21,748 --> 02:18:28,738
MATT: As you guys trudge down the alleyway, the
sky is clear now. Most of the upper areas are dry

2007
02:18:28,738 --> 02:18:32,195
other than a few rain barrels that have caught a
lot of water in the side of this alleyway. You can

2008
02:18:32,195 --> 02:18:40,040
hear the music in the distance, you can hear the
laughter of children, you can hear people playing.

2009
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:46,419
It sounds like this festival is in heavy swing.
You come to the end of the alleyway into an open

2010
02:18:46,419 --> 02:18:54,623
town square, a main open thoroughfare with large
tents that are erected, with large carts, people

2011
02:18:54,623 --> 02:19:01,313
barking for food, different carnival games set up
throughout this area. What you notice amongst the

2012
02:19:01,313 --> 02:19:10,426
buildings and houses is a large stone cathedral
that looms over this entire area. In front of this

2013
02:19:10,426 --> 02:19:19,108
cathedral, there is a raised platform where the band
is playing, where the music's coming from. People

2014
02:19:19,108 --> 02:19:26,374
all around this area are now talking and families
laughing. There are small poles that are erected

2015
02:19:26,374 --> 02:19:29,209
that are covered in flower wreaths that are hung
around it.

2016
02:19:29,209 --> 02:19:31,197
PHIL: Sounds gay.

2017
02:19:31,197 --> 02:19:35,217
MATT: Actually, quite happy and jovial.

2018
02:19:35,217 --> 02:19:44,140
IVAN: Never been so disgusted in my entire life. I
poke my legs and my torso to move them forward so

2019
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:48,976
that we can get closer to the stone. Does it look
like there's a speech

2020
02:19:48,976 --> 02:19:50,525
that's going to be starting soon?

2021
02:19:50,525 --> 02:19:52,628
MATT: People are gathered towards the center of
this area around that.

2022
02:19:52,628 --> 02:20:01,233
IVAN: I would like to motion my torso and my legs
to be on the outer edge of the front couple of

2023
02:20:01,233 --> 02:20:03,055
lines of the group.

2024
02:20:03,055 --> 02:20:04,070
MATT: Okay.

2025
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:06,296
PHIL: Look and see if there's anybody wearing
blue.

2026
02:20:06,296 --> 02:20:08,254
ASHLY: Yeah, look for the blue poop.

2027
02:20:08,254 --> 02:20:14,595
IVAN: Blue. I see silver. I see brown, which is
nice. I see red. I see--

2028
02:20:14,595 --> 02:20:16,173
ASHLY: What about blue? I don't care about the
other colors!

2029
02:20:16,173 --> 02:20:17,775
IVAN: I see purple. You mean yellow?

2030
02:20:17,775 --> 02:20:18,991
ASHLY: No! Blue!

2031
02:20:18,991 --> 02:20:20,672
PHIL: Look for the guy in the blue!

2032
02:20:20,672 --> 02:20:22,336
IVAN: I see a blue sky!

2033
02:20:22,336 --> 02:20:29,035
MATT: As this is happening, a drunk man,
30-something, a red chin-strap beard, and long

2034
02:20:29,035 --> 02:20:36,010
hair pulled into a top knot has a tankard in front
of him and, (hiccup) "Hey, happy Autumn's-thing."

2035
02:20:36,010 --> 02:20:39,286
IVAN: Happy Autumn's-thing!

2036
02:20:39,286 --> 02:20:41,004
MATT: Make a bluff check.

2037
02:20:41,004 --> 02:20:44,934
IVAN: Oh, I'm so good at bluff. 15.

2038
02:20:44,934 --> 02:20:49,681
MATT: He goes, "I think you need some more of this
than I do."

2039
02:20:49,681 --> 02:20:52,216
IVAN: Yeah, I do!

2040
02:20:52,216 --> 02:20:54,316
MATT: He pats you on the back with a hefty arm.

2041
02:20:54,316 --> 02:20:56,874
MARISHA: Whoa!

2042
02:20:56,874 --> 02:21:02,600
MATT: Since you are the guys that are holding the
legs right now, I need you to both

2043
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:04,015
make strength checks.

2044
02:21:04,015 --> 02:21:05,486
TALIESIN: Oh god!

2045
02:21:05,486 --> 02:21:06,722
ASHLY: 20.

2046
02:21:06,722 --> 02:21:08,100
TALIESIN: Five.

2047
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:13,647
MATT: Five. One leg, whoa, goes forward, and you
stumble and take a knee like you're kneeling in

2048
02:21:13,647 --> 02:21:16,603
the middle of the street. And the man who holds
the drink goes--

2049
02:21:16,603 --> 02:21:18,577
ASHLY: Kids, I want to talk to you about safe sex.

2050
02:21:18,577 --> 02:21:26,819
IVAN: I am reflecting upon the glory that is this
most holy day--

2051
02:21:26,819 --> 02:21:28,483
PHIL: Stop talking!

2052
02:21:28,483 --> 02:21:34,434
MATT: "Oh, you're one of them church types. Never
mind." And the guy stumbles off. At this point,

2053
02:21:34,434 --> 02:21:36,862
you see the crowd starting to hush a little and
gather towards--

2054
02:21:36,862 --> 02:21:38,780
TALIESIN: Hup!

2055
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:42,577
MATT: You get back up. Make a perception check if
you could, Grizznak.

2056
02:21:42,577 --> 02:21:46,627
IVAN: Okay, that was very close. 17.

2057
02:21:46,627 --> 02:21:49,427
MATT: 17. Glancing up, you can see now--

2058
02:21:49,427 --> 02:21:54,163
IVAN: I try not to put my little hand up. I put it
back down.

2059
02:21:54,163 --> 02:22:01,085
MATT: The people that are gathering towards this
central platform area you can see a person

2060
02:22:01,085 --> 02:22:06,386
ascending the steps on the side. What you see is a
man dressed in simple, but elegant blue robes that

2061
02:22:06,386 --> 02:22:10,906
walks from the cathedral, who is standing now at a
podium in the center of this. As people begin to

2062
02:22:10,906 --> 02:22:18,377
hush, some yell towards him. He has short brown
hair and a well-kept beard that show a social

2063
02:22:18,377 --> 02:22:24,379
station amongst the townspeople, although his
demeanor is very humble. But some people are

2064
02:22:24,379 --> 02:22:28,115
paying attention to him, some people are looking
around, some people are still yelling and playing

2065
02:22:28,115 --> 02:22:30,787
games. He seems to be a little frustrated that no
one's paying attention.

2066
02:22:30,787 --> 02:22:33,672
IVAN: Blue alert! Blue alert! We have a code blue!

2067
02:22:33,672 --> 02:22:34,873
TALIESIN: Running towards it.

2068
02:22:34,873 --> 02:22:37,286
PHIL: Does he have a stone?

2069
02:22:37,286 --> 02:22:38,818
IVAN: Can I see the stone at all?

2070
02:22:38,818 --> 02:22:43,274
MATT: You do not see a stone. However, as you guys
begin to make your way through the crowd, and

2071
02:22:43,274 --> 02:22:46,840
everyone's paying attention to various things in
the area, he reaches into the pocket of his robe

2072
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:57,480
and pulls out a small cast iron pellet about that
large. And he takes it, looks around, and throws

2073
02:22:57,480 --> 02:23:06,695
it to the top of this platform. As it hits the
woodwork, you hear a sudden (thunderclap). It

2074
02:23:06,695 --> 02:23:11,152
causes this echo of thunder throughout the
entirety of this area and everyone stops and goes

2075
02:23:11,152 --> 02:23:12,245
(gasp).

2076
02:23:12,245 --> 02:23:13,445
IVAN: He's got a boom cube.

2077
02:23:13,445 --> 02:23:14,593
MARISHA: He's got a boom-boom rock.

2078
02:23:14,593 --> 02:23:16,657
ASHLY: Is that the rock we want?

2079
02:23:16,657 --> 02:23:18,230
IVAN: No, it's not the rock, but I like that rock.

2080
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:19,459
PHIL: That's the rock we want!

2081
02:23:19,459 --> 02:23:24,159
IVAN: No, it's not, it's just a boom-boom rock.
Guys! You've seen boom-boom rocks. We all know

2082
02:23:24,159 --> 02:23:25,387
about boom-boom rocks.

2083
02:23:25,387 --> 02:23:26,700
PHIL: Have we seen these before?

2084
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:28,033
MATT: You have not.

2085
02:23:28,033 --> 02:23:33,650
IVAN: Okay, well, Grizznak likes to <i>think</i> he's
seen a boom-boom rock before because he's the

2086
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:36,050
smartest and the greatest Grizznak.

2087
02:23:36,050 --> 02:23:38,512
ASHLY: Is there a way to confirm whether or not
that's the rock that--?

2088
02:23:38,512 --> 02:23:42,780
MATT: Actually, for you, go ahead and roll a
wisdom check.

2089
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,523
IVAN: Oh, hohohoho.

2090
02:23:44,523 --> 02:23:46,427
PHIL: O Grizznak the Barely Alive.

2091
02:23:46,427 --> 02:23:48,395
IVAN: 21.

2092
02:23:48,395 --> 02:23:51,807
MATT: You realize at this moment, as you were
instructing the goblins that can't possibly

2093
02:23:51,807 --> 02:23:59,316
be the stone because that's a boom-boom rock, you
realize, holy shit, this entire journey was to

2094
02:23:59,316 --> 02:24:01,108
retrieve a boom-boom rock.

2095
02:24:01,108 --> 02:24:10,155
IVAN: Guys, Guffeye wants us to get boom-boom
rocks.

2096
02:24:10,155 --> 02:24:13,315
ASHLY: Why does she want us to get boom-boom
rocks?

2097
02:24:13,315 --> 02:24:15,046
IVAN: Because they're boom-boom rocks!

2098
02:24:15,046 --> 02:24:17,211
ASHLY: But we have boom-boom rocks back home!

2099
02:24:17,211 --> 02:24:22,030
MATT: With this, suddenly, you hear screams. You
hear dogs starting to bark in the distance and you

2100
02:24:22,030 --> 02:24:26,972
see the glow of flames over across the way as two
streets, three streets away, you see fire

2101
02:24:26,972 --> 02:24:29,227
beginning to glow and plumes of smoke build up.

2102
02:24:29,227 --> 02:24:30,344
MARISHA: Fire!

2103
02:24:30,344 --> 02:24:33,784
MATT: People begin to run, and chaos breaks in the
crowd as people begin looking about, screaming,

2104
02:24:33,784 --> 02:24:36,800
"What's going on?! We're under attack! Goblins are
here!"

2105
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:45,955
IVAN: Okay, so Goblon is going to lurch forward,
and I'm going to try and see-- does he have like a

2106
02:24:45,955 --> 02:24:48,283
pouch of boom-boom rocks? Or anything like that?

2107
02:24:48,283 --> 02:24:53,358
MATT: No, all you see is the single stone rolling
off the top of the stage--

2108
02:24:53,358 --> 02:24:54,607
IVAN: Mage Hand.

2109
02:24:54,607 --> 02:24:59,017
MATT: Okay, you Mage Hand and the stone stops
there in place as you begin walking towards it.

2110
02:24:59,017 --> 02:25:04,441
The crowd now is scattering and running away as
people are trying to flee from this distant flame.

2111
02:25:04,441 --> 02:25:10,001
You hear another explosion in the distance as a
section of burning wood flips.

2112
02:25:10,001 --> 02:25:15,774
MARISHA: Someone's making really <i>big</i> boom-booms.
I want to meet <i>that</i> person!

2113
02:25:15,774 --> 02:25:19,265
PHIL: Do you think that had anything to do with
the fire you set?

2114
02:25:19,265 --> 02:25:21,883
IVAN: I don't think it's the fire that I set in
the tavern.

2115
02:25:21,883 --> 02:25:25,805
ASHLY: Wait, guys, remember? There's other goblins
here.

2116
02:25:25,805 --> 02:25:28,682
IVAN: Remember, it's the Seven-Teeth--

2117
02:25:28,682 --> 02:25:30,205
PHIL: We've got to get the rock!

2118
02:25:30,205 --> 02:25:32,057
TALIESIN: Too many tooth! Get the rock.

2119
02:25:32,057 --> 02:25:35,288
PHIL: Wait, I'll ask you. Is anyone watching us?

2120
02:25:35,288 --> 02:25:40,017
IVAN: I think everyone's pretty distracted by the
big boom-booms.

2121
02:25:40,017 --> 02:25:44,638
MARISHA: Here, I can help clear this area out,
too. I light another little firecracker and throw

2122
02:25:44,638 --> 02:25:47,562
it down next to us to scare the crowd.

2123
02:25:47,562 --> 02:25:51,446
MATT: Okay, so as you throw another firecracker,
you guys stumble forward, foot by foot. I want you

2124
02:25:51,446 --> 02:25:57,184
to make another bluff check. And I want both the
legs, both of you guys to make another strength

2125
02:25:57,184 --> 02:25:58,937
check to try and get there quickly.

2126
02:25:58,937 --> 02:26:01,614
IVAN: Natural 20. That puts me up to 27.

2127
02:26:01,614 --> 02:26:02,734
MATT: Okay.

2128
02:26:02,734 --> 02:26:04,411
ASHLY: Nine.

2129
02:26:04,411 --> 02:26:05,414
TALIESIN: Ten.

2130
02:26:05,414 --> 02:26:11,469
MATT: Okay, so: as you're rushing forward you can
see the crowd look at you as you turn and be like,

2131
02:26:11,469 --> 02:26:16,174
"No! Don't go that way! The goblins are that way!"
And they're actually genuinely trying to save you.

2132
02:26:16,174 --> 02:26:19,019
IVAN: I will save us from this goblin scum!

2133
02:26:19,019 --> 02:26:23,954
MATT: And as you say that, the firecracker goes
off behind. Everyone looks around distracted, as

2134
02:26:23,954 --> 02:26:31,899
both of your legs tumble forward and you tumble
forward. The coat unravels as what was once a

2135
02:26:31,899 --> 02:26:36,129
single entity rolls into five goblin balls that
all (rolling thumps) across the stonework,

2136
02:26:36,129 --> 02:26:43,237
slamming into the base of this platform. You guys
can hear the distant screams of goblins two or

2137
02:26:43,237 --> 02:26:46,022
three streets over where the main battle's
happening. The guards have moved in that

2138
02:26:46,022 --> 02:26:53,347
direction. This open thoroughfare is mostly empty
of all people at this time. You glance over and

2139
02:26:53,347 --> 02:26:58,395
can see the stone is in the center of a light
piece of mud that hasn't fully dried from the

2140
02:26:58,395 --> 02:26:59,303
earlier storm.

2141
02:26:59,303 --> 02:27:00,441
PHIL: I go to get the stone.

2142
02:27:00,441 --> 02:27:07,022
MATT: You rush forward, grab the stone, and put it
in your hand. You hear a voice say, "Halt! You

2143
02:27:07,022 --> 02:27:13,235
"will walk no further, foul creature! Sarenrae's
vengeance will end your existence." You all glance

2144
02:27:13,235 --> 02:27:17,680
over to the left of you and you see a woman
dressed in gold armor and light blue cloth

2145
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:22,660
clutching a scimitar in one hand and a small gold
statue of a winged woman in the other. As she

2146
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:27,138
glares at you, you hear a voice behind her say,
"Come on, Kyra, don't think we'll let you

2147
02:27:27,138 --> 02:27:32,550
"have all the fun to yourself." You see, walking up
behind her, a small halfling man grinning with

2148
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:39,348
shaggy blond hair saunters up, pulling out a
flute. Behind him, a human in heavy armor, his

2149
02:27:39,348 --> 02:27:45,855
long brown, unkempt hair around his shoulders
draws two blades and scowls. "Goblins, of course."

2150
02:27:45,855 --> 02:27:53,043
He readies himself as a shield appears before him
as another heavily armored figure steps in front

2151
02:27:53,043 --> 02:27:58,133
of the lot. A tall woman wielding a longsword, her
hair pulled back tight and her face tense goes,

2152
02:27:58,133 --> 02:28:04,263
"Behind me. We shall smite them where they stand."
Behind all of them, you see an older man with long

2153
02:28:04,263 --> 02:28:09,985
white hair and a beard hold up a staff and smirk.
"Well, Seelah, I can just destroy them from here.

2154
02:28:09,985 --> 02:28:13,520
"That's fine with me." I need you all to roll
initiative.

2155
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:14,698
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

2156
02:28:14,698 --> 02:28:16,130
IVAN: Adventuring party.

2157
02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:17,919
MARISHA: Damn adventuring parties.

2158
02:28:17,919 --> 02:28:20,617
ASHLY: 21.

2159
02:28:20,617 --> 02:28:21,893
MARISHA: 22.

2160
02:28:21,893 --> 02:28:23,681
IVAN: Look at all this adventure.

2161
02:28:23,681 --> 02:28:25,251
TALIESIN: Five.

2162
02:28:25,251 --> 02:28:26,419
IVAN: I'm at an eight.

2163
02:28:26,419 --> 02:28:27,519
PHIL: 24.

2164
02:28:27,519 --> 02:28:29,302
MATT: All right, hold on just a second.

2165
02:28:29,302 --> 02:28:31,341
ASHLY: There's no fleeing in D&amp;D is there?

2166
02:28:31,341 --> 02:28:33,086
MARISHA: Yeah, you can flee.

2167
02:28:33,086 --> 02:28:34,449
PHIL: Oh, watch!

2168
02:28:34,449 --> 02:28:37,607
TALIESIN: You can do anything you like.

2169
02:28:37,607 --> 02:28:39,758
IVAN: If you've never seen goblins run before--

2170
02:28:39,758 --> 02:28:42,534
PHIL: You're going to see some hellacious fleeing
right now.

2171
02:28:42,534 --> 02:28:43,851
MARISHA: I'm not above it.

2172
02:28:43,851 --> 02:28:54,564
PHIL: Because there's a lot of them with armor and
winged statuary!

2173
02:28:54,564 --> 02:29:00,881
MARISHA: They got lots of hair. We've got really
big ears, though.

2174
02:29:00,881 --> 02:29:04,519
MATT: 20? Higher than 20, anybody?

2175
02:29:04,519 --> 02:29:05,659
PHIL: 24.

2176
02:29:05,659 --> 02:29:06,673
ASHLY: 21.

2177
02:29:06,673 --> 02:29:07,520
MARISHA: 22.

2178
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,528
MATT: Damn, look at that! All right.

2179
02:29:09,528 --> 02:29:14,475
IVAN: Super runaway!

2180
02:29:14,475 --> 02:29:18,847
MATT: That's Browntooth. You had--

2181
02:29:18,847 --> 02:29:20,230
ASHLY: 21.

2182
02:29:20,230 --> 02:29:21,282
MARISHA: 22.

2183
02:29:21,282 --> 02:29:23,110
TALIESIN: We've got the rock?

2184
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:24,281
PHIL: I've got the rock.

2185
02:29:24,281 --> 02:29:27,415
IVAN: Glad that we were able to keep it.

2186
02:29:27,415 --> 02:29:29,708
PHIL: So far.

2187
02:29:29,708 --> 02:29:36,325
MATT: These humans look ready and eager, and
there's a part of you that's like, "Oh man, it

2188
02:29:36,325 --> 02:29:39,304
"would feel good to cut them down." It is up to you
what you want to do.

2189
02:29:39,304 --> 02:29:41,966
PHIL: How many of them are there?

2190
02:29:41,966 --> 02:29:43,081
TALIESIN: Four.

2191
02:29:43,081 --> 02:29:46,442
IVAN: Four against five. Those are good goblin
numbers.

2192
02:29:46,442 --> 02:29:47,745
ASHLY: There's five of them.

2193
02:29:47,745 --> 02:29:54,395
IVAN: Oh, there's five of them? There's five of
us. That's bad goblin numbers. That's very bad

2194
02:29:54,395 --> 02:29:55,789
goblin numbers.

2195
02:29:55,789 --> 02:30:01,924
MATT: 20 to 15, anybody?

2196
02:30:01,924 --> 02:30:03,837
IVAN: Ten to 15?

2197
02:30:03,837 --> 02:30:06,470
MATT: Sorry, 20 to 15. Nope? All right.

2198
02:30:06,470 --> 02:30:14,810
ASHLY: I'm all for smashing stuff, but I smashed a
wall, I smashed a crate. I'm down to run.

2199
02:30:14,810 --> 02:30:16,349
MATT: 15 to ten?

2200
02:30:16,349 --> 02:30:19,121
IVAN: 15 to ten, no.

2201
02:30:19,121 --> 02:30:22,746
MATT: Nope. Ten to five?

2202
02:30:22,746 --> 02:30:23,949
IVAN: Eight.

2203
02:30:23,949 --> 02:30:25,269
TALIESIN: Five.

2204
02:30:25,269 --> 02:30:33,028
TALIESIN: I like the random sounds of sheep being
tortured.

2205
02:30:33,028 --> 02:30:35,829
MARISHA: (sheep bleating)

2206
02:30:35,829 --> 02:30:39,041
TALIESIN: Thursday night. It's a nice Sunday night
right there.

2207
02:30:39,041 --> 02:30:46,455
MATT: Top of the round. All of them charge into
the square as the rest scattered. Bring this in

2208
02:30:46,455 --> 02:30:51,451
here. Browntooth, you're up first.

2209
02:30:51,451 --> 02:30:58,814
PHIL: I look for some place to hide and head there
as quickly as possible.

2210
02:30:58,814 --> 02:31:05,533
MATT: Closest place to hide here would be behind this
cart or behind the platform.

2211
02:31:05,533 --> 02:31:08,715
PHIL: Where are the attacking people?

2212
02:31:08,715 --> 02:31:10,435
MATT: They're right here.

2213
02:31:10,435 --> 02:31:20,094
PHIL: Ah! There they are. I get behind the
platform.

2214
02:31:20,094 --> 02:31:28,073
MATT: You duck around here. Go ahead and roll a
stealth check to hide in the shadows.

2215
02:31:28,073 --> 02:31:31,514
PHIL: 30.

2216
02:31:31,514 --> 02:31:33,354
MATT: 13?

2217
02:31:33,354 --> 02:31:34,496
PHIL: 30.

2218
02:31:34,496 --> 02:31:38,177
MATT: 30! Okay! You duck underneath the platform,
keeping an eye on what's happening.

2219
02:31:38,177 --> 02:31:39,757
Is that your turn?

2220
02:31:39,757 --> 02:31:40,846
PHIL: Can I see them?

2221
02:31:40,846 --> 02:31:41,830
MATT: You can see them.

2222
02:31:41,830 --> 02:31:45,356
PHIL: Yes, that's my turn.

2223
02:31:45,356 --> 02:31:47,522
MATT: Snizzler, it's your turn.

2224
02:31:47,522 --> 02:31:55,478
MARISHA: First, I'm going to take a pipe bomb and
throw it right at that one.

2225
02:31:55,478 --> 02:32:01,995
MATT: Right there? All right. He is 25 feet away.
Do you want to get a little closer to do it?

2226
02:32:01,995 --> 02:32:05,835
MARISHA: I move up one square and then I hit him.

2227
02:32:05,835 --> 02:32:08,330
MATT: Lob it! Roll for an attack.

2228
02:32:08,330 --> 02:32:12,104
IVAN: Goblin pipe bombs!

2229
02:32:12,104 --> 02:32:13,351
MARISHA: 18!

2230
02:32:13,351 --> 02:32:14,888
MATT: 18 hits!

2231
02:32:14,888 --> 02:32:16,398
ASHLY: Nice!

2232
02:32:16,398 --> 02:32:19,012
MATT: It is a touch attack, correct?

2233
02:32:19,012 --> 02:32:20,328
MARISHA: Touch attack.

2234
02:32:20,328 --> 02:32:23,343
MATT: He's actually on fire right now.

2235
02:32:23,343 --> 02:32:28,447
MARISHA: Everyone in a ten foot radius must make a
reflex save.

2236
02:32:28,447 --> 02:32:30,439
MATT: Indeed. What's the DC on that?

2237
02:32:30,439 --> 02:32:32,036
MARISHA: 14.

2238
02:32:32,036 --> 02:32:47,927
MATT: That is a failure, success, success. Three
damage, three damage, and six damage. Nice!

2239
02:32:47,927 --> 02:32:56,832
MARISHA: Plus the main dude takes 13 damage.

2240
02:32:56,832 --> 02:33:00,447
MATT: 13 points of damage! Woo!

2241
02:33:00,447 --> 02:33:06,661
MARISHA: Can I use the rest of my movement to also
run backwards?

2242
02:33:06,661 --> 02:33:10,277
MATT: Sure.

2243
02:33:10,277 --> 02:33:13,041
MARISHA: Run towards these things.

2244
02:33:13,041 --> 02:33:15,681
MATT: That's about as far as you can get right
there.

2245
02:33:15,681 --> 02:33:16,954
MARISHA: That's fine.

2246
02:33:16,954 --> 02:33:23,212
MATT: You run up, fling it, and dart away, as it
lands at the foot of the guy with the blades out,

2247
02:33:23,212 --> 02:33:28,376
he prepares himself and goes to guard as it
(explosion) bursts in front of him. You can see

2248
02:33:28,376 --> 02:33:32,753
the flames coast up and now the fire is caught
into his hair and his armor is burning from

2249
02:33:32,753 --> 02:33:38,507
whatever goblin liquid, napalm-like material you
had in there adhered to him. As the fire bursts

2250
02:33:38,507 --> 02:33:42,488
outward in a ten foot radius because of your
goblin expertise with explosive devices, the

2251
02:33:42,488 --> 02:33:48,327
flames catch the three other allies of his, who
all manage to avoid most of the impact. But you

2252
02:33:48,327 --> 02:33:52,823
do see them scarred and burned a little bit from
the side of the blast. The fighter is furious as

2253
02:33:52,823 --> 02:33:55,943
the flames lick across his torso. That ends your
turn. Piglet, you're up.

2254
02:33:55,943 --> 02:34:03,245
ASHLY: Well, you lit them on fire, so now I want
to smash them. But maybe I should run away.

2255
02:34:03,245 --> 02:34:04,764
TALIESIN: Follow your heart.

2256
02:34:04,764 --> 02:34:07,017
PHIL: Ranged attack? No.

2257
02:34:07,017 --> 02:34:08,412
ASHLY: I don't have a ranged attack.

2258
02:34:08,412 --> 02:34:10,495
MATT: You are an up-close and angry--

2259
02:34:10,495 --> 02:34:12,108
ASHLY: Screw it, I'm going to rage!

2260
02:34:12,108 --> 02:34:14,654
MATT: Yes!

2261
02:34:14,654 --> 02:34:17,490
ASHLY: So I rage.

2262
02:34:17,490 --> 02:34:23,142
MATT: You rage. You can move 40 feet because
you're a barbarian, so you can go pretty far.

2263
02:34:23,142 --> 02:34:24,378
Where do you want to go?

2264
02:34:24,378 --> 02:34:30,514
ASHLY: How up-close and personal can I get? What
dude did Marisha just hit real hard?

2265
02:34:30,514 --> 02:34:31,642
MATT: That guy.

2266
02:34:31,642 --> 02:34:33,180
ASHLY: How close can I get to him?

2267
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:34,240
MATT: You can get right up to him.

2268
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:35,366
ASHLY: Let's get right up to that guy.

2269
02:34:35,366 --> 02:34:41,849
MATT: You (yells) rush up, hammer in the air. You
get one hammer attack on this turn.

2270
02:34:41,849 --> 02:34:45,525
ASHLY: 17.

2271
02:34:45,525 --> 02:34:50,812
MATT: 17 just hits! His armor class is 17. Go
ahead and roll damage on that.

2272
02:34:50,812 --> 02:34:52,792
ASHLY: This is my d10, right?

2273
02:34:52,792 --> 02:34:53,991
MATT: Yep, d10.

2274
02:34:53,991 --> 02:34:58,276
ASHLY: Seven plus six is 13.

2275
02:34:58,276 --> 02:35:04,206
MATT: 13 points of damage. As you rush up to the
man that's on fire, you leap into the air (yells)

2276
02:35:04,206 --> 02:35:09,375
and plant your goblin Skullbreaker Hammer right
square in the chest. You can see his armor bend

2277
02:35:09,375 --> 02:35:15,247
inward and he goes (gasping) as the air escapes
with a spatter of blood that crosses your face.

2278
02:35:15,247 --> 02:35:20,504
It's warm and you take it in. As you pull back the
hammer, the flames still burning on him. He's

2279
02:35:20,504 --> 02:35:25,632
coughing up blood now from the impact. He's
already taken a very poor round.

2280
02:35:25,632 --> 02:35:29,271
That ends your turn?

2281
02:35:29,271 --> 02:35:30,643
ASHLY: Mm-hmm.

2282
02:35:30,643 --> 02:35:40,214
MATT: Angry Piglet's up front. First and foremost,
the little halfling bard shouts out to the rest of

2283
02:35:40,214 --> 02:35:47,145
the group, "Valeros, you okay, bud? All right,
let's do this. Great!" And he jumps up onto this

2284
02:35:47,145 --> 02:35:54,002
cart right here and pulls out his flute and begins
singing, "And as their footfalls to the ground,

2285
02:35:54,002 --> 02:35:58,867
"the strength and mighty muscles bound! They raise
their blades into the sky and cut those goblins

2286
02:35:58,867 --> 02:36:04,824
"nigh and high!" As he begins to sing, he bolsters
all his allies in song. You see all of them begin

2287
02:36:04,824 --> 02:36:11,560
to rally themselves for the battle, hearing their
friend accompanying this rousing fight. That

2288
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:15,191
finishes his turn. They all have bonuses to their
combat prowess.

2289
02:36:15,191 --> 02:36:16,535
PHIL: That's bullshit.

2290
02:36:16,535 --> 02:36:24,724
MATT: The paladin, who watched her friend get
pummeled in the chest and set aflame, goes, "Not

2291
02:36:24,724 --> 02:36:29,272
"on my watch!" and steps in to you and is going to
take a swing with her longsword.

2292
02:36:29,272 --> 02:36:31,724
PHIL: Paladin who worships cliches, apparently.

2293
02:36:31,724 --> 02:36:34,296
MATT: Would you consider yourself an evil
character?

2294
02:36:34,296 --> 02:36:40,301
ASHLY: I'm just trying to get mine, you know what
I mean? Probably, yeah.

2295
02:36:40,301 --> 02:36:48,676
MATT: She's going to attempt to Smite Evil as her
swift action. That's a natural 20. I have to

2296
02:36:48,676 --> 02:36:53,506
confirm to see if it crits. That is a 17. What's
your armor class?

2297
02:36:53,506 --> 02:36:54,920
ASHLY: 19.

2298
02:36:54,920 --> 02:37:01,356
MATT: 19, it does not confirm crit! However, you
do suffer--

2299
02:37:01,356 --> 02:37:12,316
ASHLY: Piglet's going to go down swinging, guys.

2300
02:37:12,316 --> 02:37:18,023
MATT: That's eight points of slashing damage as
the blade strikes into you and a burst of divine

2301
02:37:18,023 --> 02:37:24,667
energy as you feel your dark core of your
blackened goblin heart all of a sudden burn with

2302
02:37:24,667 --> 02:37:28,739
radiant, divine energy. That ends her turn.

2303
02:37:28,739 --> 02:37:32,116
PHIL: Fucking born agains.

2304
02:37:32,116 --> 02:37:41,259
MATT: Next up, this older wizard dude is going to
look to the one who threw the bomb and goes,

2305
02:37:41,259 --> 02:37:44,706
(casting) and holds aloft his staff.

2306
02:37:44,706 --> 02:37:50,101
MARISHA: What? I don't understand you! Speak
English!

2307
02:37:50,101 --> 02:37:55,833
MATT: You put out your giant goblin ear to listen
to the strange language. A pock of greenish energy

2308
02:37:55,833 --> 02:37:59,506
forms in the air as an arrow streaks towards you.

2309
02:37:59,506 --> 02:38:04,424
MARISHA: Foul play, man, foul play. Thought you
were trying to tell me something.

2310
02:38:04,424 --> 02:38:06,081
MATT: What's your armor class?

2311
02:38:06,081 --> 02:38:07,629
MARISHA: 17.

2312
02:38:07,629 --> 02:38:16,699
MATT: 17. Okay! As this arcane arrow full of acid
streaks towards you, you do a goblin cartwheel out

2313
02:38:16,699 --> 02:38:23,811
of the way and it hits a barrel behind you. It
begins to melt the barrel and you can see a thick

2314
02:38:23,811 --> 02:38:30,963
series of berries begin to spill out onto the
thoroughfare. He goes, "Oh, damn it!" He ducks

2315
02:38:30,963 --> 02:38:40,832
into this alleyway between those buildings here.
That ends his turn. The cleric, now, is going to

2316
02:38:40,832 --> 02:38:51,515
step up to the center, holds her scimitar in one hand
and her holy symbol to the sky and goes,

2317
02:38:51,515 --> 02:39:04,751
"Sarenrae, protect us!" Energy drifts off. All of
her allies heal up six hit points.

2318
02:39:04,751 --> 02:39:06,692
PHIL: All right, I'm going to kill her.

2319
02:39:06,692 --> 02:39:12,344
MATT: You also heal six hit points because you are
a living creature and you're in the radius, so you

2320
02:39:12,344 --> 02:39:15,985
heal six. Unintended consequence of her
circumstance.

2321
02:39:15,985 --> 02:39:20,190
IVAN: Because her god considers you collateral.

2322
02:39:20,190 --> 02:39:23,213
ASHLY: Her god's like, "I like this one!"

2323
02:39:23,213 --> 02:39:24,866
IVAN: I like this one's spunk!

2324
02:39:24,866 --> 02:39:26,548
ASHLY: This one's got the moxie!

2325
02:39:26,548 --> 02:39:30,775
MATT: The fighter who's on fire is going to grin
and bear the flames because he wants to take down

2326
02:39:30,775 --> 02:39:33,543
the one who smashed him with the hammer. He's
going to take another 1d6 fire damage; go ahead

2327
02:39:33,543 --> 02:39:35,280
and roll for that.

2328
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:36,727
MARISHA: Five.

2329
02:39:36,727 --> 02:39:38,980
ASHLY: Nice!

2330
02:39:38,980 --> 02:39:50,037
MATT: However, he is angrily going to unleash upon
you with his longsword and shortsword. That is 13

2331
02:39:50,037 --> 02:39:52,278
to hit with his longsword. What's your armor
class?

2332
02:39:52,278 --> 02:39:53,305
ASHLY: 19.

2333
02:39:53,305 --> 02:39:57,651
MATT: You duck out of the way. He goes in to stick
you with a shortsword. That's an 18.

2334
02:39:57,651 --> 02:40:00,228
ASHLY: 19. Yes!

2335
02:40:00,228 --> 02:40:02,089
TALIESIN: We are hard to hit.

2336
02:40:02,089 --> 02:40:03,612
ASHLY: (yelling) I'm going to live forever!

2337
02:40:03,612 --> 02:40:07,944
MATT: Can't seem to find you with his blades as he
angrily swings outward.

2338
02:40:07,944 --> 02:40:10,220
IVAN: And by forever you mean 30.

2339
02:40:10,220 --> 02:40:14,160
MATT: Grizznak, your turn.

2340
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:23,996
IVAN: Oh, crap. I think I'm going to give this a
shot. I'm going to try to get kitty-corner to

2341
02:40:23,996 --> 02:40:32,300
where Piglet is, so five feet away, not within
threat range of the group.

2342
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:34,257
MATT: There?

2343
02:40:34,257 --> 02:40:41,224
IVAN: Yeah, one more step towards me. Trying to
see if that's going to get Piglet in the way or

2344
02:40:41,224 --> 02:40:46,218
not. It may. If I have the movement, I'll do one
more right next to it.

2345
02:40:46,218 --> 02:40:47,945
MATT: Yeah, you have the movement.

2346
02:40:47,945 --> 02:41:01,071
IVAN: I'm going to mock the wizard. I'm going to
look at him and go, (casting) (sneezes) And cast

2347
02:41:01,071 --> 02:41:10,293
Flaming Sneeze. (sneezing) As gouts of flames
start coming out of my nose over and over again.

2348
02:41:10,293 --> 02:41:12,437
MARISHA: Yeah, go Grizz!

2349
02:41:12,437 --> 02:41:13,679
TALIESIN: Moldy grain, man. Not even once.

2350
02:41:13,679 --> 02:41:24,698
IVAN: I know, I get really bad allergies to grain.
Moldy grain especially. (sneezes)

2351
02:41:24,698 --> 02:41:28,462
MATT: I'm okay with this. What are the rolls you
have to make for that one?

2352
02:41:28,462 --> 02:41:41,296
IVAN: I still have to make a concentration. Shit.
My DC on it is 13 and I got a ten. Song time!

2353
02:41:41,296 --> 02:41:43,391
MARISHA: Song time!

2354
02:41:43,391 --> 02:41:50,808
IVAN: Song time for my reroll in the midst of my
sneezing, because I'm not feeling like I'm tickled

2355
02:41:50,808 --> 02:41:58,115
enough, I launch into my: (sings) Grizznak, Grizznak, the
greatest that there is! Smarter than the stupid

2356
02:41:58,115 --> 02:42:04,515
ones, even when he whizzed. Look at them run, look at
them hide, look down to watch them burn and die!

2357
02:42:04,515 --> 02:42:18,611
Zergamot will loot the corpse and then we'll take
a ride, hey! I'm going to reroll. I'm never

2358
02:42:18,611 --> 02:42:20,755
allowed be a player ever again.

2359
02:42:20,755 --> 02:42:25,496
MARISHA: Every time we've used our songs to reroll
it's gotten worse!

2360
02:42:25,496 --> 02:42:28,463
MATT: What'd you roll? Are you kidding me?!

2361
02:42:28,463 --> 02:42:30,767
ASHLY: Oh no!

2362
02:42:30,767 --> 02:42:35,252
IVAN: I will allow you to light myself on fire
with my own sneezes.

2363
02:42:35,252 --> 02:42:38,679
MATT: That's what happens!

2364
02:42:38,679 --> 02:42:41,259
TALIESIN: Do not sneeze into the wind!

2365
02:42:41,259 --> 02:42:43,253
IVAN: (sneezes)

2366
02:42:43,253 --> 02:42:46,763
MATT: Is it called Fire Sneeze or Flaming Sneeze?

2367
02:42:46,763 --> 02:42:48,329
IVAN: It's called Fire Sneeze.

2368
02:42:48,329 --> 02:42:54,751
MATT: Based on the effects of this spell, I need
you to--

2369
02:42:54,751 --> 02:43:00,179
IVAN: For two rounds, I'm doing this continually.
I keep sneezing for two rounds.

2370
02:43:00,179 --> 02:43:02,273
MATT: Roll a reflex save.

2371
02:43:02,273 --> 02:43:03,654
IVAN: All right!

2372
02:43:03,654 --> 02:43:05,404
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies!

2373
02:43:05,404 --> 02:43:06,510
IVAN: Seven!

2374
02:43:06,510 --> 02:43:14,408
MATT: Seven. Go ahead and roll 2d6 of fire damage
as you glance over at the wizard, wink, go to

2375
02:43:14,408 --> 02:43:17,581
sneeze and suddenly you catch yourself, close the
mouth.

2376
02:43:17,581 --> 02:43:29,456
IVAN: Grizznak Snopstork signs off, everybody, as
I consume myself in flames. And take ten damage.

2377
02:43:29,456 --> 02:43:31,351
PHIL: <i>That's</i> the good roll you get?

2378
02:43:31,351 --> 02:43:32,490
IVAN: That's my good roll.

2379
02:43:32,490 --> 02:43:34,051
TALIESIN: You sneeze yourself to death.

2380
02:43:34,051 --> 02:43:43,566
MATT: As you sneeze, there is a ball of flame that
bursts out of the nostrils and ears of Grizznak.

2381
02:43:43,566 --> 02:43:53,593
As smoke pours out, (yells) and falls onto the
back. (sizzling) Unconscious, but smoldering at

2382
02:43:53,593 --> 02:43:54,978
the moment.

2383
02:43:54,978 --> 02:43:57,094
MARISHA: Oh, shit! That was nuts!

2384
02:43:57,094 --> 02:44:01,492
IVAN: Just to be clear, that puts me at negative
one.

2385
02:44:01,492 --> 02:44:04,217
MATT: Negative one. Mezek, you're up.

2386
02:44:04,217 --> 02:44:05,956
ASHLY: This is not going super hot, guys.

2387
02:44:05,956 --> 02:44:08,113
PHIL: I told you to run!

2388
02:44:08,113 --> 02:44:12,802
TALIESIN: The guy who's on fire, who's not doing
well, right?

2389
02:44:12,802 --> 02:44:13,802
MATT: Yes.

2390
02:44:13,802 --> 02:44:22,708
TALIESIN: I'm going to run screaming at him. I'm
going to (yells) throw one of my awful stars

2391
02:44:22,708 --> 02:44:24,876
directly at him as I run straight up to him.

2392
02:44:24,876 --> 02:44:28,591
PHIL: Why not run <i>away</i> and throw the star? It's
a ranged weapon!

2393
02:44:28,591 --> 02:44:31,839
MATT: Mid-run, you throw a star using your deadly
aim.

2394
02:44:31,839 --> 02:44:44,359
TALIESIN: I am using my deadly aim. That can't
possibly go poorly. That's 18.

2395
02:44:44,359 --> 02:44:48,118
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with the
additional plus two damage for the deadly aim.

2396
02:44:48,118 --> 02:44:51,981
TALIESIN: I don't have to roll damage, it's an
auto. That's six points of damage. (yells)

2397
02:44:51,981 --> 02:45:01,814
MATT: As you rush up, you throw it, it embeds in
the side of his throat and he's like (coughing).

2398
02:45:01,814 --> 02:45:04,908
He reaches up and pulls it out and a gout of
blood goes (spraying). He's like (grunting)

2399
02:45:04,908 --> 02:45:11,350
holding his longsword in one hand. "Stupid
goblins!" As the flames are still burning around

2400
02:45:11,350 --> 02:45:14,083
him. You move all the way up to him.

2401
02:45:14,083 --> 02:45:16,114
TALIESIN: I'm straight up in their business.

2402
02:45:16,114 --> 02:45:18,855
MATT: Ending your turn, we're back up to the top
of the round. Browntooth, you're up.

2403
02:45:18,855 --> 02:45:20,315
IVAN: Drunken master.

2404
02:45:20,315 --> 02:45:26,739
PHIL: Now, I like you guys, I really do.

2405
02:45:26,739 --> 02:45:28,662
IVAN: But super run away?

2406
02:45:28,662 --> 02:45:31,542
MATT: They have no idea you're hiding.

2407
02:45:31,542 --> 02:45:34,115
MARISHA: You have the rock, don't you?

2408
02:45:34,115 --> 02:45:35,313
PHIL: Yep!

2409
02:45:35,313 --> 02:45:42,052
IVAN: Oh, that would be very goblin of you to just
leave everyone to die and be the one that brings the

2410
02:45:42,052 --> 02:45:45,734
boom-boom rock back to Guffeye.

2411
02:45:45,734 --> 02:45:52,917
PHIL: I would be her favorite. Especially if I
were the only one left! I might get a drink with

2412
02:45:52,917 --> 02:46:08,552
dinner! But first, I am going to shoot my light
crossbow at the-- there's the flaming fellow--

2413
02:46:08,552 --> 02:46:12,998
MATT: Right there. There's the paladin, and
there's the cleric there. That's the bard.

2414
02:46:12,998 --> 02:46:18,847
PHIL: Should I finish off the big guy?

2415
02:46:18,847 --> 02:46:20,553
TALIESIN: He's on fire.

2416
02:46:20,553 --> 02:46:23,980
IVAN: He's got blood coming out the side of his
neck.

2417
02:46:23,980 --> 02:46:26,451
PHIL: I could reach all of them.

2418
02:46:26,451 --> 02:46:30,124
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can hit anybody you like.
There's a bard, a cleric--

2419
02:46:30,124 --> 02:46:33,245
PHIL: The wizard has run off.

2420
02:46:33,245 --> 02:46:34,560
TALIESIN: He's run off.

2421
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:37,680
ASHLY: You could try to finish off flame dude.

2422
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:40,228
MARISHA: Whereabouts are you, Browntooth?

2423
02:46:40,228 --> 02:46:42,601
ASHLY: He's behind that platform over yonder.

2424
02:46:42,601 --> 02:46:44,677
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's the yellow circle.

2425
02:46:44,677 --> 02:46:49,642
PHIL: The cleric.

2426
02:46:49,642 --> 02:46:52,783
MATT: Go ahead and roll for attack.

2427
02:46:52,783 --> 02:46:56,883
ASHLY: Ooh! 17 plus nine.

2428
02:46:56,883 --> 02:47:02,449
PHIL: 25.

2429
02:47:02,449 --> 02:47:07,441
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits. Go ahead and
roll damage with additional 2d6 sneak attack

2430
02:47:07,441 --> 02:47:08,922
damage.

2431
02:47:08,922 --> 02:47:12,121
PHIL: Should I do them all at once?

2432
02:47:12,121 --> 02:47:14,357
TALIESIN: Yeah, do them all at once.

2433
02:47:14,357 --> 02:47:17,317
PHIL: (grunts) Seven.

2434
02:47:17,317 --> 02:47:27,402
MATT: Seven points of damage to the cleric. The
bolt strikes the back of the cleric's lower torso,

2435
02:47:27,402 --> 02:47:32,157
the kidney area and she goes (grunts) and almost
drops the holy symbol, catching it in the middle

2436
02:47:32,157 --> 02:47:38,941
of the air, looks around. Make a stealth check to
see if you manage to remain hidden this round.

2437
02:47:38,941 --> 02:47:42,681
PHIL: 29. No, 26.

2438
02:47:42,681 --> 02:47:49,409
MATT: 26. She glances around and doesn't know
where it came from and is like (grunts). Are you

2439
02:47:49,409 --> 02:47:52,234
going to move, or are you going to stay where you
are?

2440
02:47:52,234 --> 02:47:59,042
PHIL: Stay where I am. Stupid goblins. Run!
Leave!

2441
02:47:59,042 --> 02:48:01,873
MATT: That ends your turn. Snizzler, you're up,
Piglet, you're on deck.

2442
02:48:01,873 --> 02:48:09,079
MARISHA: Seeing where Browntooth is, I'm like,
he's got the right idea. I'm going to move up like

2443
02:48:09,079 --> 02:48:19,634
to here. Over one. Yeah. Throw another bomb at the
cleric. Yeah.

2444
02:48:19,634 --> 02:48:25,186
MATT: You lob it towards the cleric. Go ahead and
roll for an attack.

2445
02:48:25,186 --> 02:48:32,210
MARISHA: Bombs! Boom boom! That's not good at
all!

2446
02:48:32,210 --> 02:48:33,418
IVAN: It scatters!

2447
02:48:33,418 --> 02:48:38,290
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, it does technically
scatter. I'm going to let it scatter.

2448
02:48:38,290 --> 02:48:41,133
MATT: What'd you roll?

2449
02:48:41,133 --> 02:48:44,083
MARISHA: I rolled a four plus eight, so 12.

2450
02:48:44,083 --> 02:48:50,422
MATT: Yeah, 12, that's going to miss.

2451
02:48:50,422 --> 02:48:56,292
IVAN: It lands right on Grizznak, on his
unconscious corpse.

2452
02:48:56,292 --> 02:48:58,594
MATT: It's going to land right there.

2453
02:48:58,594 --> 02:49:00,351
MARISHA: Oh, perfect!

2454
02:49:00,351 --> 02:49:13,829
MATT: Minimum damage on that is six. I need a reflex
save from Piglet and from Mezek.

2455
02:49:13,829 --> 02:49:17,305
All right, that's six damage to all of
them.

2456
02:49:17,305 --> 02:49:18,948
ASHLY: It is 11.

2457
02:49:18,948 --> 02:49:21,343
MATT: You take six fire damage.

2458
02:49:21,343 --> 02:49:22,484
TALIESIN: 20.

2459
02:49:22,484 --> 02:49:23,897
MATT: You take three points.

2460
02:49:23,897 --> 02:49:25,256
TALIESIN: I take zero because I have evasion.

2461
02:49:25,256 --> 02:49:30,934
MARISHA: Fire! I continue my movement towards
Browntooth.

2462
02:49:30,934 --> 02:49:37,752
ASHLY: I might go down, but I'm going to go
down--

2463
02:49:37,752 --> 02:49:40,788
TALIESIN: You're as close to a tank as a goblin
can be.

2464
02:49:40,788 --> 02:49:42,122
ASHLY: That's true.

2465
02:49:42,122 --> 02:49:45,259
MATT: Remember, your maximum hit points went up to
what your rage score is.

2466
02:49:45,259 --> 02:49:50,253
ASHLY: Oh, that's right! 44?

2467
02:49:50,253 --> 02:49:51,719
MATT: Whatever it says.

2468
02:49:51,719 --> 02:49:52,865
ASHLY: Yeah, 44.

2469
02:49:52,865 --> 02:49:55,444
MATT: As you're raging, your hit points are up
higher.

2470
02:49:55,444 --> 02:49:57,982
ASHLY: That's right, so I'm not at 24 maximum hit
points.

2471
02:49:57,982 --> 02:50:03,268
MATT: Keep that in mind. All right. That ends
Snizzler's turn. You're up.

2472
02:50:03,268 --> 02:50:07,081
ASHLY: There's no way I can take my hammer and hit
multiple people? No?

2473
02:50:07,081 --> 02:50:11,868
MATT: No, but because you're raging and you're in
base to base with them, you can attack and bite.

2474
02:50:11,868 --> 02:50:17,364
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to attack flame dude. With
my normal attack.

2475
02:50:17,364 --> 02:50:19,967
MATT: Go ahead and roll with your normal attack.

2476
02:50:19,967 --> 02:50:22,333
ASHLY: 20 naturally, plus nine.

2477
02:50:22,333 --> 02:50:23,358
MATT: Natural 20?

2478
02:50:23,358 --> 02:50:24,691
TALIESIN: Golden snitch, motherfuckers!

2479
02:50:24,691 --> 02:50:27,085
MATT: Roll again to see if you can confirm
critical. Roll another d20.

2480
02:50:27,085 --> 02:50:28,797
IVAN: Piglet MVP!

2481
02:50:28,797 --> 02:50:30,482
ASHLY: 12 plus nine?

2482
02:50:30,482 --> 02:50:34,779
MATT: Plus nine? That's a critical hit! What's the
damage multiplier on that?

2483
02:50:34,779 --> 02:50:35,683
ASHLY: Huh?

2484
02:50:35,683 --> 02:50:37,291
MATT: It should have a multiplier next to the
weapon.

2485
02:50:37,291 --> 02:50:38,523
ASHLY: Times three.

2486
02:50:38,523 --> 02:50:40,313
MATT: Roll 3d10.

2487
02:50:40,313 --> 02:50:42,100
ASHLY: 3d10?!

2488
02:50:42,100 --> 02:50:49,495
MATT: Yes, plus six. 3d10 plus six damage.

2489
02:50:49,495 --> 02:50:53,122
PHIL: Are the zeroes tens?

2490
02:50:53,122 --> 02:50:54,151
MATT: Yeah.

2491
02:50:54,151 --> 02:50:58,743
ASHLY: Oh, zeroes are tens? 21 plus six. 26.

2492
02:50:58,743 --> 02:51:03,405
MATT: How do you want to finish him off? Because
you destroy him. So, the man who's on fire in

2493
02:51:03,405 --> 02:51:04,947
front of you with his two weapons out.

2494
02:51:04,947 --> 02:51:06,363
PHIL: That's the one you hit?

2495
02:51:06,363 --> 02:51:08,657
ASHLY: That's the guy. Damn it, I wish I had gone
for the other one.

2496
02:51:08,657 --> 02:51:13,420
MATT: How do you want to finish him off? He's
(heavy breathing).

2497
02:51:13,420 --> 02:51:20,767
ASHLY: I want to knock his head off with the
hammer and I want it to fall into the lap of his

2498
02:51:20,767 --> 02:51:26,340
now grieving friend and spray blood all over them.
The most adjacent friend. No, the bard.

2499
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:27,167
I hate the bard.

2500
02:51:27,167 --> 02:51:28,347
MATT: The bard?

2501
02:51:28,347 --> 02:51:30,225
ASHLY: Hit the bard in the head with his friend's
head.

2502
02:51:30,225 --> 02:51:36,795
MATT: You swing as the fighter goes to parry your
blow. Your goblin rage gets you a faster speed

2503
02:51:36,795 --> 02:51:41,044
than he ever expected. As he goes to swing it to
the side, the hammer comes straight across from

2504
02:51:41,044 --> 02:51:44,434
the direction he wasn't expecting, like an
unintentional feint. His eyes goes wide for a

2505
02:51:44,434 --> 02:51:49,693
second before the hammer (slams) and the head gets
carried off of his shoulders. It spins backwards,

2506
02:51:49,693 --> 02:51:56,039
and the bard, who's singing his song, looks up as
his friend's head towards him. Falls onto his feet and goes

2507
02:51:56,039 --> 02:52:02,567
(yells). Makes a concentration. Fails his
concentration. I'll say the song ends, he has to

2508
02:52:02,567 --> 02:52:10,569
start it again because he just saw his friend's
head land at his feet. He goes, "Valero? You!" You

2509
02:52:10,569 --> 02:52:14,528
can see there is a genuine horror and sadness in
his face.

2510
02:52:14,528 --> 02:52:16,100
ASHLY: I go: Yay!

2511
02:52:16,100 --> 02:52:18,859
TALIESIN: You still have a bite attack!

2512
02:52:18,859 --> 02:52:20,136
ASHLY: I still have a bite attack!

2513
02:52:20,136 --> 02:52:21,198
MATT: Yes, you do!

2514
02:52:21,198 --> 02:52:22,459
ASHLY: Who's by him?

2515
02:52:22,459 --> 02:52:24,797
MATT: This is the paladin right here.

2516
02:52:24,797 --> 02:52:25,948
ASHLY: I'll bite the paladin.

2517
02:52:25,948 --> 02:52:28,693
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack.

2518
02:52:28,693 --> 02:52:30,382
TALIESIN: Cleric's right there.

2519
02:52:30,382 --> 02:52:31,951
ASHLY: Is that a six or a nine?

2520
02:52:31,951 --> 02:52:34,368
TALIESIN: That's a nine.

2521
02:52:34,368 --> 02:52:36,896
ASHLY: That's a nine? Okay, so 13?

2522
02:52:36,896 --> 02:52:43,381
MATT: 13? Oh, the paladin? Yeah, it definitely
misses the paladin. Her shield's too big. You go

2523
02:52:43,381 --> 02:52:47,876
to bite her and she slams the shield out and you
catch metal instead. She pulls the shield away and

2524
02:52:47,876 --> 02:52:52,431
you scrape tooth marks against the metal, which is
impressive for a goblin. She looks at you and

2525
02:52:52,431 --> 02:52:58,418
goes, "You! You foul, terrible creature! You will
pay for what you've done!" You see tears in her

2526
02:52:58,418 --> 02:53:00,841
eyes. That ends your turn?

2527
02:53:00,841 --> 02:53:10,045
ASHLY: I go: Heh, loser. I'm going to stay there.
Maybe that's unwise, but I'm

2528
02:53:10,045 --> 02:53:11,604
just going to stay there.

2529
02:53:11,604 --> 02:53:19,708
MATT: The bard is too angry to even consider-- no.
No, he's too angry. He's not going to be able to

2530
02:53:19,708 --> 02:53:24,010
do his bard performances this turn. He's too
fraught with frustration.

2531
02:53:24,010 --> 02:53:26,664
He's going to cast Sleep.

2532
02:53:26,664 --> 02:53:28,219
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

2533
02:53:28,219 --> 02:53:36,967
MATT: As part of the Sleep spell, just to double
check what the saves are; I believe it's a will

2534
02:53:36,967 --> 02:53:57,163
save. There we go, we got Sleep. Give me a second,
guys. I need you to make a will saving throw.

2535
02:53:57,163 --> 02:53:59,635
ASHLY: A will saving throw? Okay.

2536
02:53:59,635 --> 02:54:01,725
MATT: You get plus two because you're raging.

2537
02:54:01,725 --> 02:54:04,141
ASHLY: Where is my--?

2538
02:54:04,141 --> 02:54:08,455
TALIESIN: It's on the third square on the right.

2539
02:54:08,455 --> 02:54:17,561
ASHLY: Oh, I see. Okay. 19.

2540
02:54:17,561 --> 02:54:23,480
MATT: With that, you look over as the bard ends up
singing this incantation in a language you don't

2541
02:54:23,480 --> 02:54:29,902
understand. You feel a wave of sudden sleepiness
hit you. One of your eyes begins to sag, and then

2542
02:54:29,902 --> 02:54:35,813
you (grunts) shake it off. Foam forming at the
corner of your mouth. The bard goes (yelling).

2543
02:54:35,813 --> 02:54:37,896
ASHLY: I go (blows raspberry).

2544
02:54:37,896 --> 02:54:46,999
MATT: Unaffected by it. That ends his turn. The
paladin, friend is gone, cannot do anything yet,

2545
02:54:46,999 --> 02:54:53,014
is going to angrily move this way to begin a
pincer movement and is going to power attack you.

2546
02:54:53,014 --> 02:54:55,187
That is a natural 20.

2547
02:54:55,187 --> 02:54:56,692
ASHLY: Oh no!

2548
02:54:56,692 --> 02:55:07,048
MATT: See if it confirms. With a natural 18, I'm
pretty sure that hits. That's times two on that.

2549
02:55:07,048 --> 02:55:20,170
You take-- it's not too bad, you take 12 points of
damage as the sword streaks down, cleaving off

2550
02:55:20,170 --> 02:55:26,555
part of your ear and ends up embedding in your
shoulder. You look over, grab the sword, and pull

2551
02:55:26,555 --> 02:55:30,805
it out and throw her backward. She's caught off
guard by how this tiny thing has so much might.

2552
02:55:30,805 --> 02:55:49,523
That ends the paladin's turn there. We're going to
bring us to the cleric. The cleric is going to see

2553
02:55:49,523 --> 02:55:57,078
how rough this is, circumstantially. She is
looking over at the bombing one. Moves over here,

2554
02:55:57,078 --> 02:56:03,695
turns to you and goes, "You will set nothing more
ablaze, creature!" I need you to make a will

2555
02:56:03,695 --> 02:56:04,767
saving throw.

2556
02:56:04,767 --> 02:56:11,229
MARISHA: Eh? What? Natural one. Again.

2557
02:56:11,229 --> 02:56:13,781
IVAN: You shouldn't even sit next to me.

2558
02:56:13,781 --> 02:56:16,493
PHIL: Your luck is rubbing off.

2559
02:56:16,493 --> 02:56:25,973
MATT: As the Hold Person takes effect, your muscles
lock up. As you're reaching for a bomb (grunting).

2560
02:56:25,973 --> 02:56:32,102
You just can't move! You see a grin across the
cleric's face. "That's what I thought." Ending the

2561
02:56:32,102 --> 02:56:38,956
cleric's turn. The fighter is gone. Boom.
Grizznak, you're down to negative two.

2562
02:56:38,956 --> 02:56:43,993
IVAN: Yeah, negative two. Can I make a
constitution check to see if I can stabilize?

2563
02:56:43,993 --> 02:56:49,135
MATT: Go ahead and make a fortitude save.

2564
02:56:49,135 --> 02:56:51,535
IVAN: Fortitude save. Oh! 20!

2565
02:56:51,535 --> 02:56:56,112
MATT: 20? I'll say, for the sake of this, you
manage to stabilize, you're no longer bleeding.

2566
02:56:56,112 --> 02:57:01,689
You're good. That ending your turn. Mezek, you're
up.

2567
02:57:01,689 --> 02:57:07,360
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up to the cleric who
just paralyzed my friend. I'm going to run right

2568
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:11,165
up to him. Him, her, I don't actually know the
right pronouns for the cleric.

2569
02:57:11,165 --> 02:57:17,411
MATT: You frog leap over the raging Piglet, and
land.

2570
02:57:17,411 --> 02:57:25,822
TALIESIN: And I (yells) and I open palm into the
throat to use a stunning fist to try to silence her.

2571
02:57:25,822 --> 02:57:27,506
MATT: Go for an attack.

2572
02:57:27,506 --> 02:57:33,074
TALIESIN: That's a 15?

2573
02:57:33,074 --> 02:57:35,588
MATT: 15 hits! She doesn't have a huge armor
class.

2574
02:57:35,588 --> 02:57:50,687
TALIESIN: I said fist, I'm doing fist. That's five
points of damage and needs to make a fortitude save.

2575
02:57:50,687 --> 02:57:54,121
MATT: Which she rolls a five, she does not.

2576
02:57:54,121 --> 02:57:55,480
TALIESIN: She is stunned for a round.

2577
02:57:55,480 --> 02:58:02,736
MATT: Yep. As you jump over, leap to the ground
and then shoryuken-like upper fist to her chin.

2578
02:58:02,736 --> 02:58:10,189
You see a tooth go flying and her helmet gets set
off. She pulls back. She drops the holy symbol in

2579
02:58:10,189 --> 02:58:15,471
her hand, which now hangs from a chain, grabs at
her head going (groaning) and is doubled over

2580
02:58:15,471 --> 02:58:20,743
unable to gather her senses right now. Ending your
turn there. Browntooth, you're up.

2581
02:58:20,743 --> 02:58:24,666
PHIL: Crossbow attack at the paladin.

2582
02:58:24,666 --> 02:58:28,149
MATT: Paladin? All right, go for it. Roll the
attack for that one.

2583
02:58:28,149 --> 02:58:34,568
ASHLY: It's 14.

2584
02:58:34,568 --> 02:58:39,574
TALIESIN: You could try to maybe reroll it with a song.
You haven't used your song yet.

2585
02:58:39,574 --> 02:58:41,718
MATT: You haven't used your song yet, if you
wanted.

2586
02:58:41,718 --> 02:58:45,417
ASHLY: Maybe this'll be the first time that it
gets a better roll.

2587
02:58:45,417 --> 02:58:53,539
PHIL: Yes, this is the one time. And my life's
not at stake. All right. I will sing my song.

2588
02:58:53,539 --> 02:58:55,239
MATT: What's your song?

2589
02:58:55,239 --> 02:59:02,635
PHIL: (sings) When Browntooth axe lifts up high, someone
is about to die! Someone will bleed, lots will get

2590
02:59:02,635 --> 02:59:08,573
bit, though I'd rather avoid direct conflict. I'm
Browntooth the Rogue!

2591
02:59:08,573 --> 02:59:15,156
MATT: Go ahead and reroll that as you steel
yourself, locking in another bolt into the

2592
02:59:15,156 --> 02:59:16,189
crossbow.

2593
02:59:16,189 --> 02:59:22,498
IVAN: Songs are cursed! All of our songs are
cursed!

2594
02:59:22,498 --> 02:59:24,064
MATT: (singing) Goblin songs are cursed!

2595
02:59:24,064 --> 02:59:25,765
MARISHA: People hate goblin songs.

2596
02:59:25,765 --> 02:59:27,359
PHIL: It's worse than K-Pop.

2597
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:30,555
MATT: I got you a sad trombone for you, there.

2598
02:59:30,555 --> 02:59:34,810
IVAN: Yep. Deserve it.

2599
02:59:34,810 --> 02:59:38,054
PHIL: Man. At least I didn't die. No offense.

2600
02:59:38,054 --> 02:59:39,931
IVAN: None taken.

2601
02:59:39,931 --> 02:59:50,201
MATT: As the crossbow bolt goes off somewhere into
the skyline, you're realizing perhaps the distance

2602
02:59:50,201 --> 02:59:54,466
game isn't working for you. Might need to get up
close and personal if you're going to land an

2603
02:59:54,466 --> 02:59:56,523
attack here. Are you going to stay where you are?

2604
02:59:56,523 --> 03:00:08,563
PHIL: Is the church that way?

2605
03:00:08,563 --> 03:00:11,914
MATT: The church is up here. These are the steps
to the church.

2606
03:00:11,914 --> 03:00:22,510
PHIL: I move over to the edge of the podium.

2607
03:00:22,510 --> 03:00:24,367
MATT: Over here?

2608
03:00:24,367 --> 03:00:25,457
PHIL: Yeah.

2609
03:00:25,457 --> 03:00:28,471
MATT: Roll to see if you can remain stealthed.

2610
03:00:28,471 --> 03:00:31,647
PHIL: 30.

2611
03:00:31,647 --> 03:00:37,262
MATT: All right. Ending your turn. Brings it to
Snizzler. You're locked in place. Make a will

2612
03:00:37,262 --> 03:00:41,604
saving throw to see if you can resist the effect
of the Hold Person spell.

2613
03:00:41,604 --> 03:00:45,479
MARISHA: Just a straight will save?

2614
03:00:45,479 --> 03:00:46,589
MATT: Yeah.

2615
03:00:46,589 --> 03:00:47,888
MARISHA: Three.

2616
03:00:47,888 --> 03:00:50,542
TALIESIN: How is that even humanly--?

2617
03:00:50,542 --> 03:00:54,547
MATT: Unable to shake the effect. You're still
locked in place. Hand on the bomb. You're looking

2618
03:00:54,547 --> 03:00:58,215
down at it. You were about to light it and your
hand is hovering there and you're like

2619
03:00:58,215 --> 03:00:59,423
(strains).

2620
03:00:59,423 --> 03:01:03,664
TALIESIN: I cast Methadone.

2621
03:01:03,664 --> 03:01:05,461
MATT: Piglet, you're up.

2622
03:01:05,461 --> 03:01:10,551
ASHLY: I'm going to rage. I'm going to attack the
paladin.

2623
03:01:10,551 --> 03:01:13,119
MATT: You can both hammer and bite.

2624
03:01:13,119 --> 03:01:15,044
ASHLY: I'm going to do both.

2625
03:01:15,044 --> 03:01:16,528
MATT: Go for it.

2626
03:01:16,528 --> 03:01:18,378
ASHLY: 18 plus nine.

2627
03:01:18,378 --> 03:01:20,464
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll the hammer
damage.

2628
03:01:20,464 --> 03:01:23,117
MARISHA: Roll that hammer damage!

2629
03:01:23,117 --> 03:01:25,017
ASHLY: That is 12.

2630
03:01:25,017 --> 03:01:31,177
MATT: 12? Ooh! As you bring up and slam the hammer
down, she pushes the shield up to block the blow,

2631
03:01:31,177 --> 03:01:35,968
but the mallet catches over the top. The sheer
weight of it pushes the shield away as it comes

2632
03:01:35,968 --> 03:01:41,636
down and slams into the side of her chin. You can
see the jaw breaks from the impact. A little bit

2633
03:01:41,636 --> 03:01:46,203
of blood begins to trickle out of the corner of her
mouth. She's like (pained grunting). She spits a

2634
03:01:46,203 --> 03:01:48,938
glob of blood across her otherwise pristine silver
armor.

2635
03:01:48,938 --> 03:01:51,801
PHIL: Seriously, she's all about cliches. Does she
do this?

2636
03:01:51,801 --> 03:01:55,620
MATT: Roll for the bite attack.

2637
03:01:55,620 --> 03:02:01,044
ASHLY: 18 plus four.

2638
03:02:01,044 --> 03:02:04,659
MATT: That also hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2639
03:02:04,659 --> 03:02:06,199
ASHLY: A d3 plus three.

2640
03:02:06,199 --> 03:02:08,636
MATT: Roll a d6, halve that, add three.

2641
03:02:08,636 --> 03:02:11,709
ASHLY: Four.

2642
03:02:11,709 --> 03:02:15,265
MATT: Four points of damage. As she's reacting
from that and spits the blood out, looks down, you

2643
03:02:15,265 --> 03:02:19,960
run up the side of her shield and bite into the
chin you just broke and tear a chunk out of her

2644
03:02:19,960 --> 03:02:26,041
face! She's like, (screaming) "Who does
that?!"

2645
03:02:26,041 --> 03:02:28,717
ASHLY: Piglet does, bitches!

2646
03:02:28,717 --> 03:02:36,073
MATT: That ends Piglet's turn. The bard, whose
spell has been less than active, and the wizard who

2647
03:02:36,073 --> 03:02:41,667
spent his last term in absolute horror of his
friend, regains his senses and is going to step up.

2648
03:02:41,667 --> 03:02:43,495
ASHLY: Oh, I forgot about the wizard.

2649
03:02:43,495 --> 03:02:47,511
MATT: Yeah, the wizard hid off to the side and
watched his friend get beheaded and spent the turn

2650
03:02:47,511 --> 03:02:55,495
looking in horror. The bard is going to attempt to
cast Sleep on you again.

2651
03:02:55,495 --> 03:02:57,992
Make another willpower save.

2652
03:02:57,992 --> 03:03:03,905
ASHLY: I'm raging, so it still applies, right? 18
plus three.

2653
03:03:03,905 --> 03:03:08,763
MATT: 18 plus three. Once again, shrug off the
effect. And he's like, "Why won't you stay down,

2654
03:03:08,763 --> 03:03:13,215
"stupid thing?!" He's pointing his finger,
clutching his flute angrily in the other hand.

2655
03:03:13,215 --> 03:03:15,215
Nothing is affecting you.

2656
03:03:15,215 --> 03:03:16,483
TALIESIN: Red Bull!

2657
03:03:16,483 --> 03:03:23,324
MATT: He's going to rush over to the side behind
the cleric now and be like, "Can you heal me?

2658
03:03:23,324 --> 03:03:30,688
"Please!" He's running off to the side and asking
for a heal. The paladin is going to, as a reaction

2659
03:03:30,688 --> 03:03:39,955
to you, furiously swing at you with the longsword.
That is a 22 to hit.

2660
03:03:39,955 --> 03:03:41,675
ASHLY: It hits.

2661
03:03:41,675 --> 03:03:48,697
MATT: That hits. You take seven points of slashing
damage as the blade streaks down across you.

2662
03:03:48,697 --> 03:03:54,631
You're still chewing the chunk of her face that's
running around in your jaw, but the blade goes

2663
03:03:54,631 --> 03:04:00,145
across the front of your torso, and leaves an
opening that begins to spill dark, brackish,

2664
03:04:00,145 --> 03:04:05,351
goblin blood. You don't even feel the pain. You're
in such a furious bloodlust right now.

2665
03:04:05,351 --> 03:04:08,075
ASHLY: So, next round might be my last round,
guys.

2666
03:04:08,075 --> 03:04:11,119
PHIL: When we get down to two, I'm going to take
off.

2667
03:04:11,119 --> 03:04:13,633
ASHLY: I got 11 hit points left.

2668
03:04:13,633 --> 03:04:15,327
MATT: The wizard's going to step forward now.

2669
03:04:15,327 --> 03:04:17,633
TALIESIN: This round might be your last round.

2670
03:04:17,633 --> 03:04:22,728
MATT: Going to go ahead and cast Magic Missile.
One arcs off at you while you're held in place.

2671
03:04:22,728 --> 03:04:24,431
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

2672
03:04:24,431 --> 03:04:30,047
MATT: One's going to streak off and hit you.
Mezek, you take two points of force damage.

2673
03:04:30,047 --> 03:04:37,787
Snizzler, you take three points of force damage as
two missiles arc off and slam into the sides of

2674
03:04:37,787 --> 03:04:46,451
you from the arcane nature of the spell. That ends
his turn. The cleric can't do anything, is stunned

2675
03:04:46,451 --> 03:04:51,812
this round. Manages to shrug it off, but has
absolutely no way of using any of her abilities

2676
03:04:51,812 --> 03:04:56,369
because of the fist in the face she got from
Mezek. Grizznak!

2677
03:04:56,369 --> 03:04:59,145
IVAN: (singing) I found a nest of baby birds.

2678
03:04:59,145 --> 03:05:03,188
MATT: Finishing that. Mezek, it's your turn.

2679
03:05:03,188 --> 03:05:13,811
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my Flurry of Blows, with my
quarterstaff, and I'm going to use Stunning Fist, again.

2680
03:05:13,811 --> 03:05:15,151
MATT: Your last?

2681
03:05:15,151 --> 03:05:16,159
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2682
03:05:16,159 --> 03:05:19,011
MATT: Go for it! So you are doing two punches or
two hits with your quarterstaff?

2683
03:05:19,011 --> 03:05:21,299
TALIESIN: Well, Stunning First, is it fist or
first?

2684
03:05:21,299 --> 03:05:26,439
MATT: Stunning Fist is as an attack; you can have
it be a Stunning Fist attack.

2685
03:05:26,439 --> 03:05:31,078
TALIESIN: So I'm going to (punching sounds). I'm
going to use the quarterstaff.

2686
03:05:31,078 --> 03:05:33,136
MATT: So roll for that, see if it hits.

2687
03:05:33,136 --> 03:05:39,255
TALIESIN: For the Stunning Fist first; that's 20.

2688
03:05:39,255 --> 03:05:46,177
MATT: 20, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage on
that. Rolls a seven.

2689
03:05:46,177 --> 03:05:48,083
TALIESIN: That's six points of damage.

2690
03:05:48,083 --> 03:05:51,794
MATT: Six points of damage and she is stunned
again. Quarterstaff clocks her upside the head,

2691
03:05:51,794 --> 03:05:55,547
now causing the armor to bend in on her temple and
one eye has gone a little

2692
03:05:55,547 --> 03:05:57,456
cross-eyed from the impact.

2693
03:05:57,456 --> 03:05:58,848
TALIESIN: So I'm going to hit her again.

2694
03:05:58,848 --> 03:06:00,031
PHIL: Who'd you hit?

2695
03:06:00,031 --> 03:06:03,581
TALIESIN: The cleric. The cleric is unconscious.
They can't do another round of anything.

2696
03:06:03,581 --> 03:06:04,770
ASHLY: That's true.

2697
03:06:04,770 --> 03:06:05,895
TALIESIN: Hitting her again.

2698
03:06:05,895 --> 03:06:07,171
MATT: Go for it.

2699
03:06:07,171 --> 03:06:09,105
TALIESIN: That's 12.

2700
03:06:09,105 --> 03:06:11,765
MATT: 12 total bonus?

2701
03:06:11,765 --> 03:06:13,039
TALIESIN: To hit.

2702
03:06:13,039 --> 03:06:18,192
MATT: She is currently flat-footed with the armor
that's still 14, so yeah.

2703
03:06:18,192 --> 03:06:20,432
ASHLY: Is it time?

2704
03:06:20,432 --> 03:06:21,574
TALIESIN: It's time.

2705
03:06:21,574 --> 03:06:27,470
Reroll that. (singing) Mezek, Mezek the
songs he is keen, so pour a pint of beer for me or

2706
03:06:27,470 --> 03:06:29,205
I'll punch you in the spleen ugh!

2707
03:06:29,205 --> 03:06:31,680
ASHLY: Come on, this is our only chance!

2708
03:06:31,680 --> 03:06:35,085
TALIESIN: Yay! 19!

2709
03:06:35,085 --> 03:06:37,059
MATT: 19 hits, roll damage.

2710
03:06:37,059 --> 03:06:43,937
TALIESIN: I'll use the flashy pink one. Oh, that's
better! Eight points of damage, boom!

2711
03:06:43,937 --> 03:06:46,008
MATT: Eight points of damage, how do you want to
finish off the cleric?

2712
03:06:46,008 --> 03:06:47,463
ASHLY: You did it!

2713
03:06:47,463 --> 03:06:52,839
TALIESIN: Quarterstaff one to the front and then I
just want the quarterstaff to find a chink in the

2714
03:06:52,839 --> 03:06:59,064
armor and just watch the head cleave with just
stick. A big melty, awful cleave. Like, wood

2715
03:06:59,064 --> 03:07:00,376
should not cleave.

2716
03:07:00,376 --> 03:07:01,933
ASHLY: You should aim it at someone.

2717
03:07:01,933 --> 03:07:06,204
MATT: So, after you slam her in the side of the
head, stunning her, she leans forward from the

2718
03:07:06,204 --> 03:07:15,292
impact. You spin the staff in one hand and then do
a golf swing up the side of the head. You hit at

2719
03:07:15,292 --> 03:07:22,220
such a way that you cause the bent metal of the
helmet to act like a guillotine-like blade. With a

2720
03:07:22,220 --> 03:07:26,486
(boomp) her head, up in the air, rolls on the
ground, the bard who came up to ask for healing,

2721
03:07:26,486 --> 03:07:30,080
"Heal me, Heal me!" and the body slumps down on
the ground in front of him, and the head lands a

2722
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:31,319
second later.

2723
03:07:31,319 --> 03:07:33,210
IVAN: That's two heads for you!

2724
03:07:33,210 --> 03:07:37,352
MATT: And he rolls a one on his will save, he is
currently horribly shaken by this experience and

2725
03:07:37,352 --> 03:07:40,478
is having penalties from watching his two friends
lose their head in the same battle.

2726
03:07:40,478 --> 03:07:44,870
TALIESIN: Am I within quarterstaff contact of anyone
else?

2727
03:07:44,870 --> 03:07:47,505
MATT: Currently the bard, yeah.

2728
03:07:47,505 --> 03:07:50,098
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit the bard. I'm going to
spend my ki attack and hit the bard.

2729
03:07:50,098 --> 03:07:51,620
MATT: Okay.

2730
03:07:51,620 --> 03:07:56,324
MARISHA: About the time the adventuring party
starts rethinking their career choices.

2731
03:07:56,324 --> 03:07:58,910
PHIL: Ooh, it's flashing baby!!

2732
03:07:58,910 --> 03:08:00,257
MARISHA: Natural 20!

2733
03:08:00,257 --> 03:08:01,706
MATT: Roll to confirm crit.

2734
03:08:01,706 --> 03:08:03,966
MARISHA: Come on, come on! Big money, no
whammies!

2735
03:08:03,966 --> 03:08:06,733
TALIESIN: 11.

2736
03:08:06,733 --> 03:08:11,093
MATT: 11. I'll say with the penalties he has
suffered from watching his friends die, I'll say

2737
03:08:11,093 --> 03:08:12,537
it just barely hits.

2738
03:08:12,537 --> 03:08:19,611
IVAN: Taliesin is MVPing this so hard.

2739
03:08:19,611 --> 03:08:24,991
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage. Straight stab.

2740
03:08:24,991 --> 03:08:27,786
MATT: How do you want to do this to the bard?

2741
03:08:27,786 --> 03:08:32,572
TALIESIN: I want to go straight through the mouth
all the way through the skull and I want to hold

2742
03:08:32,572 --> 03:08:33,792
it there.

2743
03:08:33,792 --> 03:08:39,372
MATT: As he is screaming, the staff goes through,
bursts out the back of the base of the spine where

2744
03:08:39,372 --> 03:08:43,787
the brain connects and goes (gurgling). Blood
dribbling down the side of his mouth,

2745
03:08:43,787 --> 03:08:45,162
you hold him aloft.

2746
03:08:45,162 --> 03:08:47,091
TALIESIN: Music to my ears! (laughs)

2747
03:08:47,091 --> 03:08:50,015
MATT: What do you do with the corpse at the end of
the staff?

2748
03:08:50,015 --> 03:08:51,922
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold it for my next attack
on the next round.

2749
03:08:51,922 --> 03:08:57,428
MATT: Okay, he is currently now held limp against
your staff just being held aloft by your weapon.

2750
03:08:57,428 --> 03:08:59,043
ASHLY: Oh my god.

2751
03:08:59,043 --> 03:09:00,395
MATT: Absurd.

2752
03:09:00,395 --> 03:09:01,512
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah!

2753
03:09:01,512 --> 03:09:07,831
PHIL: How many are left? Paladin and wizard?

2754
03:09:07,831 --> 03:09:13,681
MATT: There is the wizard and the paladin and they
are both looking around themselves and wondering

2755
03:09:13,681 --> 03:09:17,250
how these goblins steamrolled their adventuring
party.

2756
03:09:17,250 --> 03:09:20,126
PHIL: And I'm still stealthed right? So this
would be sneak attack?

2757
03:09:20,126 --> 03:09:22,124
MATT: As far as you know, yes.

2758
03:09:22,124 --> 03:09:24,706
PHIL: Crossbow at the paladin.

2759
03:09:24,706 --> 03:09:26,607
MATT: Crossbow to the paladin. Go for it.

2760
03:09:26,607 --> 03:09:29,237
PHIL: 19.

2761
03:09:29,237 --> 03:09:34,357
MATT: 19 hits. What is the critical range on the
crossbow? Does it just say times something?

2762
03:09:34,357 --> 03:09:35,475
PHIL: 19 to 20.

2763
03:09:35,475 --> 03:09:37,346
MATT: So roll again to see if it crits.

2764
03:09:37,346 --> 03:09:40,992
PHIL: 18!

2765
03:09:40,992 --> 03:09:47,517
MATT: Go ahead and roll double damage on that.
Roll 2d6 plus sneak attack,

2766
03:09:47,517 --> 03:09:49,104
so 4d6 damage total on this.

2767
03:09:49,104 --> 03:09:51,027
ALL: Oh my god.

2768
03:09:51,027 --> 03:09:56,672
MARISHA: Yeah, Browntooth!

2769
03:09:56,672 --> 03:10:06,088
IVAN: Grizznak was the goblin sacrifice to
Zarongel to make all of you succeed.

2770
03:10:06,088 --> 03:10:07,572
TALIESIN: Holy shit!

2771
03:10:07,572 --> 03:10:10,920
PHIL: 16.

2772
03:10:10,920 --> 03:10:17,953
MATT: How do you want to finish the paladin? How
do you want to do this, Phil? The paladin's back

2773
03:10:17,953 --> 03:10:24,389
is to you, bearing down on Piglet now. Both
bloodied and engaged in gladiatorial combat, this

2774
03:10:24,389 --> 03:10:28,921
tiny goblin meat shield and this shielded piece of
human meat.

2775
03:10:28,921 --> 03:10:31,158
PHIL: Does the paladin have a helmet?

2776
03:10:31,158 --> 03:10:33,310
MATT: She does, yes.

2777
03:10:33,483 --> 03:10:36,059
ASHLY: You could go for the hat trick of
decapitation, if you wanted.

2778
03:10:36,059 --> 03:10:39,340
It's really up to you.

2779
03:10:39,340 --> 03:10:43,299
IVAN: Bard's dead, though, now. It wouldn't be
funny unless you landed in the--

2780
03:10:43,299 --> 03:10:44,587
TALIESIN: Still funny.

2781
03:10:44,587 --> 03:10:46,165
PHIL: Can I get to her ear?

2782
03:10:46,165 --> 03:10:47,435
MATT: Yeah!

2783
03:10:47,435 --> 03:10:49,923
PHIL: In one ear, out the other.

2784
03:10:49,923 --> 03:10:54,722
MATT: As you aim carefully, you wait for her as
the blows trade back and forth between her and

2785
03:10:54,722 --> 03:10:59,336
Piglet. After the hit, she pulls back and spits
off to the side and you can see the front of her

2786
03:10:59,336 --> 03:11:04,115
face. As her head turns back, you use that moment
to release and catch it right in the side of the

2787
03:11:04,115 --> 03:11:09,665
helmet where the ear would be. The bolt out one
side and gets partially out the other. She stands

2788
03:11:09,665 --> 03:11:16,343
there for a second before (thud) to the knees,
face first on the ground in the mud.

2789
03:11:16,343 --> 03:11:24,418
MARISHA: Man, left side of the table today. Table
Right is just sucking it up. We don't need to be

2790
03:11:24,418 --> 03:11:25,679
here, really.

2791
03:11:25,679 --> 03:11:29,392
MATT: Snizzler, make a will saving throw.

2792
03:11:29,392 --> 03:11:32,436
MARISHA: Even though she's dead, it doesn't just
break?

2793
03:11:32,436 --> 03:11:37,718
MATT: You know what? The spell does break because
the cleric's dead. You regain control of yourself.

2794
03:11:37,718 --> 03:11:39,167
Thank you for the reminder.

2795
03:11:39,167 --> 03:11:46,109
MARISHA: Good work, Team Left! Yeah! Good work,
Grizz, even though you're still unconscious.

2796
03:11:46,109 --> 03:11:49,489
MATT: There's one wizard that rushed out of the
alleyway like, okay, I can do this! Runs out and

2797
03:11:49,489 --> 03:11:55,531
all of his friends are dead and his chin's
quivering under his short, gray beard.

2798
03:11:55,531 --> 03:11:56,739
It is your turn.

2799
03:11:56,739 --> 03:11:57,748
MARISHA: Where is he at?

2800
03:11:57,748 --> 03:11:58,924
MATT: Right there.

2801
03:11:58,924 --> 03:12:10,818
MARISHA: I see the wizard and I take a step back
onto the platform right behind me. I take out my

2802
03:12:10,818 --> 03:12:12,788
goblin bomb launcher.

2803
03:12:12,788 --> 03:12:16,788
PHIL: Is that a thing?!

2804
03:12:16,788 --> 03:12:17,924
MARISHA: Yeah!

2805
03:12:17,924 --> 03:12:19,242
TALIESIN: It is now!

2806
03:12:19,242 --> 03:12:28,274
MARISHA: I go, all right! I arc it upwards and I
go boof and aim for the wizard.

2807
03:12:28,274 --> 03:12:31,770
PHIL: Thankfully, he's far enough away that none of the
rest of us will catch fire.

2808
03:12:31,770 --> 03:12:37,087
MATT: A cross between a bazooka and a large egg
shell. She jams the bomb into it. As it detonates,

2809
03:12:37,087 --> 03:12:44,032
it sends out a wave of smoke and ash. It blows
apart and sets you on your feet from the impact of

2810
03:12:44,032 --> 03:12:50,146
the launcher. Roll the attack, it doubles the
range. That's just enough.

2811
03:12:50,146 --> 03:12:54,063
MARISHA: 18!

2812
03:12:54,063 --> 03:13:01,389
MATT: 18 does hit. His armor, with mage armor, of
16. Go ahead and roll damage on that. That's 2d6

2813
03:13:01,389 --> 03:13:05,036
plus three plus 1d4 because of your explosive
feat.

2814
03:13:05,036 --> 03:13:13,296
MARISHA: Six plus three plus two, so 11 damage.

2815
03:13:13,296 --> 03:13:19,831
MATT: 11 points of damage and he is on fire. As he
looks over and is like, "My friends. What?!"

2816
03:13:19,831 --> 03:13:26,296
(explosion) He's screaming on fire.

2817
03:13:26,296 --> 03:13:28,299
PHIL: Water balloon from hell.

2818
03:13:28,299 --> 03:13:29,898
IVAN: Whee!

2819
03:13:29,898 --> 03:13:34,158
MATT: That's Snizzler's turn. Piglet, you're up.

2820
03:13:34,158 --> 03:13:37,056
ASHLY: Wizard! I run.

2821
03:13:37,056 --> 03:13:39,996
IVAN: Wizard!

2822
03:13:39,996 --> 03:13:43,683
MATT: Leaping on top of the cart that is there
before him.

2823
03:13:43,683 --> 03:13:50,426
ASHLY: As expected, I rage. I'm going to do the
Skullbreaker on him.

2824
03:13:50,426 --> 03:13:52,523
MATT: Go for it. Leaping in the air.

2825
03:13:52,523 --> 03:13:54,279
ASHLY: Oh no! That was terrible! 11.

2826
03:13:54,279 --> 03:13:59,836
MATT: You go and swing with the hammer, and
because the flames are hot in your face, you swing

2827
03:13:59,836 --> 03:14:08,342
wide and end up smashing part of the cart instead.
He looks at you through the fire going, "No!"

2828
03:14:08,342 --> 03:14:10,586
TALIESIN: Can you take a bite?

2829
03:14:10,586 --> 03:14:11,646
ASHLY: No.

2830
03:14:11,646 --> 03:14:15,996
MATT: You have to be right up close to do that.
That finishes your turn, Piglet. Everyone else is

2831
03:14:15,996 --> 03:14:24,033
dead. The wizard is in the flames going, "No!" and
put out his hands like this and a gout of fire

2832
03:14:24,033 --> 03:14:28,070
like a flamethrower bursts from the arcane
energies. Go ahead and roll d6 fire damage,

2833
03:14:28,070 --> 03:14:29,473
by the way.

2834
03:14:29,473 --> 03:14:35,080
MARISHA: Burn, wizard, burn! Another point of
damage.

2835
03:14:35,080 --> 03:14:40,180
ASHLY: Man, that's going to be a bummer way to go
out after I missed a hammer attack.

2836
03:14:40,180 --> 03:14:44,111
MATT: Go ahead and make a reflex save, if you
could.

2837
03:14:44,111 --> 03:14:45,331
ASHLY: Nine.

2838
03:14:45,331 --> 03:14:46,610
TALIESIN: Plus your reflex save?

2839
03:14:46,610 --> 03:14:47,885
ASHLY: Yeah.

2840
03:14:47,885 --> 03:14:50,074
MATT: You take six points of fire damage.

2841
03:14:50,074 --> 03:14:51,618
ASHLY: I'm still alive!

2842
03:14:51,618 --> 03:14:58,797
MATT: Through the flames, more flames come. You
burn, the cinders. What little bit of hair may have existed

2843
03:14:58,797 --> 03:15:05,903
on you is gone. You are a charred, black mass of
cracked goblin flesh and anger. You're enjoying

2844
03:15:05,903 --> 03:15:11,161
being on the edge of death. That ends his turn. No
one else is alive. You.

2845
03:15:11,161 --> 03:15:16,019
IVAN: Hi. I found the bird's nest!

2846
03:15:16,019 --> 03:15:18,157
MATT: Mezek, you're up.

2847
03:15:18,157 --> 03:15:25,207
TALIESIN: I want to see if I can get enough of a
pull to remove the head of the bard from the body

2848
03:15:25,207 --> 03:15:29,931
and fling it as a projectile attack at the
wizard.

2849
03:15:29,931 --> 03:15:31,245
MATT: You're horrible!

2850
03:15:31,245 --> 03:15:33,058
TALIESIN: I'm the worst person you know!

2851
03:15:33,058 --> 03:15:38,794
MATT: You can use that. We're going to consider
this an improvised ranged weapon. Go ahead and

2852
03:15:38,794 --> 03:15:44,566
roll an attack with your dexterity bonus as opposed
to your strength bonus. With a minus four, because

2853
03:15:44,566 --> 03:15:47,211
you're not proficient in ranged improvised
weapons. Just melee ones.

2854
03:15:47,211 --> 03:15:48,274
TALIESIN: That'll work.

2855
03:15:48,274 --> 03:15:50,423
MATT: What's your dex modifier?

2856
03:15:50,423 --> 03:15:51,383
TALIESIN: Four.

2857
03:15:51,383 --> 03:15:55,278
MATT: Roll a d20 and add three to it.

2858
03:15:55,278 --> 03:15:56,290
TALIESIN: Add three?

2859
03:15:56,290 --> 03:15:57,509
MATT: Just your attack bonus.

2860
03:15:57,509 --> 03:15:58,734
PHIL: He's just making shit up!

2861
03:15:58,734 --> 03:16:02,338
TALIESIN: 14.

2862
03:16:02,338 --> 03:16:06,894
MATT: 14 unfortunately misses. You look through
the flames, he goes (heavy panting) and looks over

2863
03:16:06,894 --> 03:16:12,009
as the bard head careens towards him and ricochets
off his arcane armor. He goes (screaming).

2864
03:16:12,009 --> 03:16:13,882
TALIESIN: I'm running straight towards him.

2865
03:16:13,882 --> 03:16:23,133
MATT: Your monk speed, you get right next to him.
He's being surrounded now. Browntooth.

2866
03:16:23,133 --> 03:16:29,644
PHIL: I can't reach him, can I? Can I shoot him?

2867
03:16:29,644 --> 03:16:31,770
ASHLY: Everyone else is dead, so you can get
closer.

2868
03:16:31,770 --> 03:16:32,920
PHIL: Oh, that's true.

2869
03:16:32,920 --> 03:16:34,371
MATT: You can move this way.

2870
03:16:34,371 --> 03:16:36,511
PHIL: I'll move up to the wizard.

2871
03:16:36,511 --> 03:16:38,613
MATT: You can get there and see him off to the
side.

2872
03:16:38,613 --> 03:16:41,262
TALIESIN: He's flanked, also.

2873
03:16:41,262 --> 03:16:45,202
IVAN: Why didn't you run, wizard?

2874
03:16:45,202 --> 03:16:47,654
PHIL: Am I flanking him?

2875
03:16:47,654 --> 03:16:53,538
MATT: Roll a stealth to see if he sees you. He
does not. He is so distracted with all his dead

2876
03:16:53,538 --> 03:16:57,460
friends and being on fire, there's no way he can
beat your stealth score with a six he rolled.

2877
03:16:57,460 --> 03:16:58,448
PHIL: 28.

2878
03:16:58,448 --> 03:17:00,246
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Go ahead and roll an
attack.

2879
03:17:00,246 --> 03:17:06,660
IVAN: Watch as Phil finishes off the final
character for the night.

2880
03:17:06,660 --> 03:17:08,848
PHIL: 16.

2881
03:17:08,848 --> 03:17:16,504
MATT: 16 just hits! Go ahead and roll. That is his
AC with mage armor. Go ahead and roll 3d6.

2882
03:17:16,504 --> 03:17:22,683
PHIL: 13.

2883
03:17:22,683 --> 03:17:25,461
MATT: 13. How do you want to do this?

2884
03:17:25,461 --> 03:17:26,674
ASHLY: Wow!

2885
03:17:26,674 --> 03:17:28,380
MARISHA: Yeah!

2886
03:17:28,380 --> 03:17:35,293
MATT: On fire, looking aghast at the heroes slain
around him.

2887
03:17:35,293 --> 03:17:38,462
PHIL: Nose?

2888
03:17:38,462 --> 03:17:41,410
IVAN: Nose.

2889
03:17:41,410 --> 03:17:44,512
TALIESIN: Nose is good, we haven't done that.

2890
03:17:44,512 --> 03:17:49,480
PHIL: Right through his nose. Up the nose, into
the brain.

2891
03:17:49,480 --> 03:17:55,011
MATT: He's over there and he's like (heavy
breathing). As he looks over, up to the sky, for

2892
03:17:55,011 --> 03:18:03,442
the first time in his entire existence becoming a
religious man. At the cathedral. The flames behind

2893
03:18:03,442 --> 03:18:13,253
the cathedral from the mounting goblin hordes that
are descending upon this square. He goes, "Why?"

2894
03:18:13,253 --> 03:18:19,690
as the bolt strikes him right in the center. His
eyes go wide and, slo-mo, (thud). The flames

2895
03:18:19,690 --> 03:18:24,204
(sizzling) consuming the rest of his body on the
ground.

2896
03:18:24,204 --> 03:18:29,835
MARISHA: Whoa! That was rad! Rad!

2897
03:18:29,835 --> 03:18:35,080
MATT: You guys can now hear the screams in the
distance still growing louder. You can barely see

2898
03:18:35,080 --> 03:18:39,889
the shadows of the Seven-Tooth goblin horde coming
down the mountain,

2899
03:18:39,889 --> 03:18:41,319
coming through the alleyway here.

2900
03:18:41,319 --> 03:18:42,485
TALIESIN: Back to the sewers!

2901
03:18:42,485 --> 03:18:43,433
PHIL: Now can we go?!

2902
03:18:43,433 --> 03:18:49,109
MARISHA: Hang on. Snizzler walks over and pours a
Cure Light Wounds down.

2903
03:18:49,109 --> 03:18:51,267
IVAN: You had one this entire time?

2904
03:18:51,267 --> 03:18:52,437
MARISHA: Just one.

2905
03:18:52,437 --> 03:18:54,295
TALIESIN: Power was with her all along.

2906
03:18:54,295 --> 03:18:55,874
MATT: You gain five hit points.

2907
03:18:55,874 --> 03:18:59,780
IVAN: Hey, guys. Did we win? Oh!

2908
03:18:59,780 --> 03:19:03,913
PHIL: Thanks for your help!

2909
03:19:03,913 --> 03:19:06,538
MARISHA: Dude, you were unconscious. It was so
cool.

2910
03:19:06,538 --> 03:19:11,693
IVAN: Did anyone die in a really cool and very
glorifying way?

2911
03:19:11,693 --> 03:19:15,075
MARISHA: Yeah, you did, man! It was awesome.

2912
03:19:15,075 --> 03:19:17,403
IVAN: Well, shit!

2913
03:19:17,403 --> 03:19:19,730
MARISHA: Yeah! All right, let's go.

2914
03:19:19,730 --> 03:19:21,008
ASHLY: We run.

2915
03:19:21,008 --> 03:19:29,582
IVAN: Also, before I leave, goblin dickbutt,
goblin dickbutt.

2916
03:19:29,582 --> 03:19:40,222
MATT: Every corpse is marked appropriately
with your victory token of the goblin dickbutt.

2917
03:19:40,222 --> 03:19:44,741
MARISHA: As they go down into the sewer, I'm going
to be the last one and I'm going to take my last

2918
03:19:44,741 --> 03:19:50,055
bomb launcher. I'm going to aim for the church.

2919
03:19:50,055 --> 03:19:53,267
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

2920
03:19:53,267 --> 03:19:55,117
IVAN: That's the best!

2921
03:19:55,117 --> 03:19:58,125
MATT: (laughing) Roll an attack!

2922
03:19:58,125 --> 03:20:06,270
MARISHA: In the sushi again! Ooh! 21.

2923
03:20:06,270 --> 03:20:14,400
MATT: (explosion) You see an explosion as flames
begin to burn up on the long tapestries that hang in

2924
03:20:14,400 --> 03:20:20,289
the front of the temple. Inside, you see two
people that were hiding in the temple from the

2925
03:20:20,289 --> 03:20:25,538
goblin hordes come running out on fire just as the
goblin hordes round the corner and go (screaming)

2926
03:20:25,538 --> 03:20:32,427
and rush and start striking them down, stabbing
them repeatedly with their blades. The rest of the

2927
03:20:32,427 --> 03:20:37,515
temple begins to catch flames as it licks out the
sides of the now-shattering stained glass. You nod

2928
03:20:37,515 --> 03:20:40,247
your head proudly before you dart back into the sewer
after your friends.

2929
03:20:40,247 --> 03:20:41,431
MARISHA: Grizz.

2930
03:20:41,431 --> 03:20:43,032
IVAN: What's this?

2931
03:20:43,032 --> 03:20:46,076
MARISHA: This is my art.

2932
03:20:46,076 --> 03:20:48,291
PHIL: (singing) Amazing Grace.

2933
03:20:48,291 --> 03:20:51,315
TALIESIN: (singing) How sweet the sound!

2934
03:20:51,315 --> 03:20:54,114
IVAN: I'm so proud of you.

2935
03:20:54,114 --> 03:20:56,860
MARISHA: Thank you, man. It's beautiful.

2936
03:20:56,860 --> 03:21:04,060
MATT: You guys your way out of what remains of the
town of Sandpoint. Heroes left scattered across

2937
03:21:04,060 --> 03:21:10,085
the center of the festival grounds. Make your way
all the way back to your home.

2938
03:21:10,085 --> 03:21:14,255
PHIL: All right, now I'm glad I didn't run away.

2939
03:21:14,255 --> 03:21:16,669
ASHLY: Aren't you? That was pretty sick.

2940
03:21:16,669 --> 03:21:20,608
MATT: You head past to the west side of the
Devil's Platter Mountains to the home

2941
03:21:20,608 --> 03:21:22,438
of where your--

2942
03:21:22,438 --> 03:21:23,963
PHIL: Old Guffeye.

2943
03:21:23,963 --> 03:21:31,622
MATT: Yep. Where Old Guffeye is. You head back
into her cavernous abode. She sits there waiting.

2944
03:21:31,622 --> 03:21:41,708
There's a smell of extremely nasty boiling liquid.
She spins around. "You! You've returned! And do you

2945
03:21:41,708 --> 03:21:45,651
"bring me the promised stone?"

2946
03:21:45,651 --> 03:21:49,452
ASHLY: Well, I helped a lot! But--

2947
03:21:49,452 --> 03:21:52,217
PHIL: I brought the stone!

2948
03:21:52,217 --> 03:21:54,911
MATT: "Give me it. Give it to me."

2949
03:21:54,911 --> 03:21:56,274
PHIL: I hand to her.

2950
03:21:56,274 --> 03:22:03,538
MATT: She takes the stone. "Yes!" The Lady's
blessing upon you all. She spins around, drops the

2951
03:22:03,538 --> 03:22:12,796
stone in the pot and begins stirring it. "Stone
soup for meal tonight! Flavored well with victory.

2952
03:22:12,796 --> 03:22:17,430
"You've earned a fine meal, my goblins!"

2953
03:22:17,430 --> 03:22:22,751
(cheering)

2954
03:22:22,751 --> 03:22:29,311
MATT: As she pours you all your evening's meal of
boom-boom stone soup, you recount the tales of the

2955
03:22:29,311 --> 03:22:35,209
horrible slaughter that befell those who walked in
your path. You realize you managed to bring back a

2956
03:22:35,209 --> 03:22:37,960
trench coat as part of your victory prize.

2957
03:22:37,960 --> 03:22:40,647
PHIL: Stir in a little bit of dried meat with it.

2958
03:22:40,647 --> 03:22:44,941
IVAN: We throw it on top of our trophy pile.

2959
03:22:44,941 --> 03:22:46,950
TALIESIN: And an empty snuff box tin.

2960
03:22:46,950 --> 03:22:51,288
MARISHA: And some poo and some bottles for molotov
cocktails.

2961
03:22:51,288 --> 03:22:53,535
MATT: A masterful bounty you've collected this
evening.

2962
03:22:53,535 --> 03:22:55,820
IVAN: I cast Grease on all of us.

2963
03:22:55,820 --> 03:23:00,330
MARISHA: Slip'n'Slide!

2964
03:23:00,330 --> 03:23:08,160
MATT: Freeze frame credit roll. (singing) Anyway
you want, that's the way you need it. And that is

2965
03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:15,215
your game tonight, your one-shot Pathfinder game.
Big thank you, once again, to Paizo and to

2966
03:23:15,215 --> 03:23:20,557
Syrinscape for helping us put this together, for
bringing the prizes for our fantastic audience.

2967
03:23:20,557 --> 03:23:27,408
Thank you all for watching this wondrously chaotic
goblin spree that transpired. Big round of

2968
03:23:27,408 --> 03:23:30,290
applause for our players this evening. You did
amazing.

2969
03:23:30,290 --> 03:23:33,997
PHIL: Pure, unadulterated Id.

2970
03:23:33,997 --> 03:23:42,627
IVAN: Seriously, #TeamLeftSide. For all of the
deaths you dished out.

2971
03:23:42,627 --> 03:23:46,999
MATT: We're rolling for the grand prize winner
right now. While they're doing that, I don't know

2972
03:23:46,999 --> 03:23:55,481
if you're aware, but you systematically slaughtered
the Iconic Heroes of the Pathfinder universe.

2973
03:23:55,481 --> 03:23:57,635
ASHLY: That's their actual stats and everything?

2974
03:23:57,635 --> 03:23:58,669
MATT: Yeah.

2975
03:23:58,669 --> 03:23:59,781
ASHLY: Oh my god.

2976
03:23:59,781 --> 03:24:01,937
MARISHA: The ones that are always in the books?

2977
03:24:01,937 --> 03:24:03,242
MATT: In the books, yeah!

2978
03:24:03,242 --> 03:24:04,706
ASHLY: That's amazing!

2979
03:24:04,706 --> 03:24:08,123
MATT: The actual Pathfinder Iconic characters!

2980
03:24:08,123 --> 03:24:09,442
MARISHA: We killed Pathfinder!

2981
03:24:09,442 --> 03:24:11,193
ASHLY: Yay! We murdered it!

2982
03:24:11,193 --> 03:24:13,519
MARISHA: These people, yeah!

2983
03:24:13,519 --> 03:24:15,857
TALIESIN: I was prepared to go down in a blaze of
glory.

2984
03:24:15,857 --> 03:24:17,464
ASHLY: Yeah, me too! I thought we were all
going to die.

2985
03:24:17,464 --> 03:24:23,108
MATT: For those who weren't aware, the Attack on
Sandpoint is actually the very first encounter adventure

2986
03:24:23,108 --> 03:24:30,516
in The Rise of the Runelords campaign setting and
adventure guide for Pathfinder. You guys played

2987
03:24:30,516 --> 03:24:35,908
the other half of that battle. What's normally the
first fight for the heroes, they got slaughtered

2988
03:24:35,908 --> 03:24:37,317
by five goblins.

2989
03:24:37,317 --> 03:24:40,539
ASHLY: So this merry band of people came together,
are like, "We're going adventuring!" Their first

2990
03:24:40,539 --> 03:24:44,425
day out, they fight a group of goblins that
beheaded all of them.

2991
03:24:44,425 --> 03:24:48,316
IVAN: In an alternate dimension, we TPKed another
Pathfinder game.

2992
03:24:48,316 --> 03:24:52,327
TALIESIN: Congratulations, we are the darkest
timeline.

2993
03:24:52,327 --> 03:25:02,569
MARISHA: Somewhere, there's a whole new set of
gamers being like, "This RPG shit's bullshit. I

2994
03:25:02,569 --> 03:25:06,739
"died at level two. It was stupid. I'm over it."

2995
03:25:06,739 --> 03:25:08,877
MATT: Well done, guys.

2996
03:25:08,877 --> 03:25:10,600
IVAN: Thank you, Matt!

2997
03:25:10,600 --> 03:25:12,180
ASHLY: Thank you, Matt! Amazing!

2998
03:25:12,180 --> 03:25:14,803
PHIL: I felt like I was in another world!

2999
03:25:14,803 --> 03:25:22,284
MARISHA: So they get these cool little goblin
things, and this cool stuffies?

3000
03:25:22,284 --> 03:25:27,311
IVAN: There's a lot that's in the big package.
It's all books, and all stuff.

3001
03:25:27,311 --> 03:25:32,670
MATT: All these little goblin things are available
on the Paizo store, guys. The banks look awesome.

3002
03:25:32,670 --> 03:25:33,821
IVAN: The banks are cool.

3003
03:25:33,821 --> 03:25:37,173
MATT: It's good desk accessories.

3004
03:25:37,173 --> 03:25:44,827
IVAN: As a sidebar statement, I would like to say
that even though 17k and Ivan breathes fire, I

3005
03:25:44,827 --> 03:25:54,404
don't know if we hit 17k or not. Oh, we did? This
is not fortuitous. I will not actually light

3006
03:25:54,404 --> 03:25:55,708
myself on fire.

3007
03:25:55,708 --> 03:25:57,555
TALIESIN: Have you actually ever breathed fire
before?

3008
03:25:57,555 --> 03:26:03,473
IVAN: Yeah! I do it a lot, but I'm not going to
sneeze fire and then light myself on fire.

3009
03:26:03,473 --> 03:26:06,272
PHIL: Sneezing fire is different than breathing
fire.

3010
03:26:06,272 --> 03:26:08,541
TALIESIN: Sneezing fire would blow my mind. I've
never seen that before.

3011
03:26:08,541 --> 03:26:09,815
IVAN: Different orifices.

3012
03:26:09,815 --> 03:26:12,364
MATT: This is Ivan breathing it, not Grizznak.

3013
03:26:12,364 --> 03:26:18,847
PHIL: Grizznak really is lucky to be alive. He
literally died three times.

3014
03:26:18,847 --> 03:26:21,368
IVAN: I actually was hoping that you guys would
leave me there.

3015
03:26:21,368 --> 03:26:27,489
MARISHA: I debated. I was like, I'm chaotic evil.
Technically, I wouldn't. Well, you're my homie,

3016
03:26:27,489 --> 03:26:29,047
it's fine.

3017
03:26:29,047 --> 03:26:31,225
PHIL: If we had to carry you? No.

3018
03:26:31,225 --> 03:26:36,495
IVAN: If you carried me, I would have expected you
to throw me in the stew to have for the rest of

3019
03:26:36,495 --> 03:26:38,857
the evening with the boom-boom stone.

3020
03:26:38,857 --> 03:26:45,059
MATT: Oh my god, that was delightfully ridiculous.
Well done, guys.

3021
03:26:45,059 --> 03:26:47,634
PHIL: Whose dice are these?

3022
03:26:47,634 --> 03:26:49,088
MARISHA: We got a winner?

3023
03:26:49,088 --> 03:26:58,411
MATT: PacManWakkaWakka. Grand prize winner. You're
going to get a fantastic care package courtesy of

3024
03:26:58,411 --> 03:27:04,321
Paizo that involves Pathfinder Core Rulebook,
Monster Codex, Inner Sea Races Book, Burnt

3025
03:27:04,321 --> 03:27:08,392
Offerings Book, We Be Goblins, the goblin promo
figure, the challenge square flip mat, which you

3026
03:27:08,392 --> 03:27:14,470
got to see right here, goblin bank, plush, and a
one-year subscription to Syrinscape. That is

3027
03:27:14,470 --> 03:27:16,075
fantastic, congratulations!

3028
03:27:16,075 --> 03:27:18,017
MARISHA: And a one-year subscription to
Syrinscape?

3029
03:27:18,017 --> 03:27:18,978
MATT: Yeah!

3030
03:27:18,978 --> 03:27:25,067
MARISHA: That was some good music. I really liked
the drum one. The tribal one.

3031
03:27:25,067 --> 03:27:27,236
MATT: Great music tracks. You can customize your
own tracks.

3032
03:27:27,236 --> 03:27:28,619
IVAN: The sewers were great.

3033
03:27:28,619 --> 03:27:31,429
MARISHA: The screaming people were great.

3034
03:27:31,429 --> 03:27:40,239
MATT: There was a bar brawl in case you guys used
a bar brawl as a way to get through. Here's the

3035
03:27:40,239 --> 03:27:43,044
tavern brawl. Go ahead and hit that there.

3036
03:27:43,044 --> 03:27:45,315
IVAN: Awesome.

3037
03:27:45,315 --> 03:27:54,813
MATT: Dudes beating the crap out of each other.
You can put in glass shattering punches.

3038
03:27:54,813 --> 03:27:59,532
IVAN: Syrinscape also has not just a fantasy
division, but they also have an entire sci-fi

3039
03:27:59,532 --> 03:28:05,652
catalogue, too. I know we used it a bunch on the
TMNT.

3040
03:28:05,652 --> 03:28:07,211
MATT: For the record.

3041
03:28:07,211 --> 03:28:08,614
(Wilhelm scream)

3042
03:28:08,614 --> 03:28:10,558
TALIESIN: Oh my god, they have a Wilhelm!

3043
03:28:10,558 --> 03:28:19,512
MATT: Wilhelm is on the sound list there. You have
a dragon if you want to use it. It's the best bar

3044
03:28:19,512 --> 03:28:24,225
brawl ever. Sad trombone, which we got to use
earlier.

3045
03:28:24,225 --> 03:28:28,323
IVAN: All things you want while your players are
doing stupid things.

3046
03:28:28,323 --> 03:28:33,603
MATT: It's really cool stuff. If you have spells,
like a fire spell, which you didn't get to hear

3047
03:28:33,603 --> 03:28:36,230
over the music when you burst into flame last
time.

3048
03:28:36,230 --> 03:28:37,883
MARISHA: Did you do it, though?

3049
03:28:37,883 --> 03:28:39,249
MATT: Yeah.

3050
03:28:39,249 --> 03:28:42,541
TALIESIN: This, by the way, is what an evening at
Matt Mercer's house is like. He's sitting going,

3051
03:28:42,541 --> 03:28:44,900
"Look at this!" (trombone)

3052
03:28:44,900 --> 03:28:46,465
MATT: I make the sounds happen!

3053
03:28:46,465 --> 03:28:52,905
TALIESIN: This was Sunday evening, pretty much.
Add YouTube and that's pretty much it.

3054
03:28:52,905 --> 03:28:57,974
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't do a lot when we have the
opportunity.

3055
03:28:57,974 --> 03:29:05,447
IVAN: It was a pleasure being unconscious for most
of the battle. Thank you.

3056
03:29:05,447 --> 03:29:07,361
MARISHA: You did so much early on.

3057
03:29:07,361 --> 03:29:10,054
PHIL: You tried to talk us out of our mission.

3058
03:29:10,054 --> 03:29:13,449
IVAN: I did so enjoy all of the wayward things.

3059
03:29:13,449 --> 03:29:15,653
PHIL: That's not it!

3060
03:29:15,653 --> 03:29:19,486
TALIESIN: Just think, you might have lived if you
hadn't taken that bramble damage. I just want you to

3061
03:29:19,548 --> 03:29:26,161
live with that. Sleep like a baby tonight. I want
you to sleep like a baby.

3062
03:29:26,161 --> 03:29:28,925
IVAN: That's going to keep me awake, you asshole.

3063
03:29:28,925 --> 03:29:30,377
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

3064
03:29:30,377 --> 03:29:32,243
IVAN: You know what? Suck it.

3065
03:29:32,243 --> 03:29:33,432
TALIESIN: Live with it.

3066
03:29:33,432 --> 03:29:37,046
PHIL: How much ass would we have kicked if <i>any</i>
of the songs had worked?

3067
03:29:37,046 --> 03:29:39,607
TALIESIN: I got the one.

3068
03:29:39,607 --> 03:29:41,557
MATT: You got one.

3069
03:29:41,557 --> 03:29:44,935
ASHLY: Thank god. That would have been really
depressing if none of the songs worked.

3070
03:29:44,935 --> 03:29:46,550
TALIESIN: I roll really well.

3071
03:29:46,550 --> 03:29:48,440
MARISHA: We all sang our song once.

3072
03:29:48,440 --> 03:29:50,269
MATT: Everyone got to sing their song once, which
is cool.

3073
03:29:50,269 --> 03:29:52,258
TALIESIN: I wrote mine on my lunch break today.

3074
03:29:52,258 --> 03:29:58,608
MATT: You guys were awesome. Thank you guys so
much for watching. Thank you guys for playing. You

3075
03:29:58,608 --> 03:30:03,029
guys should come Thursday at 7:00pm to see the
50th episode of Critical Role.

3076
03:30:03,029 --> 03:30:05,824
TALIESIN: It's going to be crazy.

3077
03:30:05,824 --> 03:30:10,205
IVAN: Feel free to stick around next Monday.

3078
03:30:10,205 --> 03:30:11,270
MATT: Every Monday!

3079
03:30:11,270 --> 03:30:13,921
PHIL: Every Monday in the week?

3080
03:30:13,921 --> 03:30:21,198
IVAN: Every Monday, and it sucks because I won't
be there next week because of Tabletop and for the

3081
03:30:21,198 --> 03:30:28,107
next three weeks, but you'll see we'll be playing
Kick Ass and Chew Bubblegum next week. It's a fun

3082
03:30:28,107 --> 03:30:35,060
little one-off. You have two actions. You can
either chew bubblegum or you can kick ass.

3083
03:30:35,060 --> 03:30:36,871
MARISHA: That's fantastic.

3084
03:30:36,871 --> 03:30:40,108
IVAN: If you ever run out of bubblegum, you can
only kick ass.

3085
03:30:40,108 --> 03:30:44,573
MARISHA: What happens if you run out of kicking
ass?

3086
03:30:44,573 --> 03:30:46,692
IVAN: You can't ever run out of kicking ass.

3087
03:30:46,692 --> 03:30:50,926
PHIL: There's always ass to kick. But bubblegum
is finite.

3088
03:30:50,926 --> 03:30:59,089
IVAN: If you ever want to explore the weird and
wacky RPGs and explore small campaigns, not unlike

3089
03:30:59,089 --> 03:31:02,415
this scenario in little chunks, tune in Monday.

3090
03:31:02,415 --> 03:31:03,945
MATT: You should run a Hole game sometimes.

3091
03:31:03,945 --> 03:31:06,451
IVAN: What's that? Hole's on my list.

3092
03:31:06,451 --> 03:31:07,755
TALIESIN: I love Hole.

3093
03:31:07,755 --> 03:31:13,354
MATT: He got me the Hole books for my birthday a
couple years ago. And all the expansions.

3094
03:31:13,354 --> 03:31:15,120
IVAN: We also want to play Tune. Do you know
Tune?

3095
03:31:15,120 --> 03:31:16,191
TALIESIN: I don't know Tune.

3096
03:31:16,191 --> 03:31:17,222
MATT: You don't know Tune?

3097
03:31:17,222 --> 03:31:18,462
TALIESIN: Oh, Tune! Yes.

3098
03:31:18,462 --> 03:31:22,719
IVAN: Tune's basically Saturday morning cartoon
show, the role-playing game.

3099
03:31:22,719 --> 03:31:25,271
TALIESIN: I've been trying to dig up Tofos for
you, too.

3100
03:31:25,271 --> 03:31:27,494
MARISHA: Like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the RPG?

3101
03:31:27,494 --> 03:31:28,525
IVAN: Basically.

3102
03:31:28,525 --> 03:31:29,799
ASHLY: That sounds really cool.

3103
03:31:29,799 --> 03:31:32,660
IVAN: There's a lot of really fun systems out
there. A lot of them don't get a lot of attention

3104
03:31:32,660 --> 03:31:37,820
because they're either independently published or
whatever, but we find them and have a good time

3105
03:31:37,820 --> 03:31:38,886
with them.

3106
03:31:38,886 --> 03:31:40,219
MATT: That's what No Survivors is about.

3107
03:31:40,219 --> 03:31:51,195
IVAN: It's called No Survivors because characters
can die and it's okay. Anyway. Thank you, Matt.

3108
03:31:51,195 --> 03:31:54,895
MATT: Thank you, guys. No Survivors, every Monday
here, 7:00pm, Critical Role every Thursday at

3109
03:31:54,895 --> 03:32:01,285
7:00pm. Thank you guys so much for coming. Have a
wonderful night, and we'll see you Thursday. Bye!
