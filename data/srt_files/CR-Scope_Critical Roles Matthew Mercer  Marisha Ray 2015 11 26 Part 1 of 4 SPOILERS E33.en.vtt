00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:03.881
[drumbeat]

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:08.910
MARISHA: Let's see here. Eyy! There's people!

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.919
MATT: It's working now?

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:12.281
MARISHA: It is working!

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:13.712
MATT: All right!

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:18.520
MATT and MARISHA: Tweeted it out.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520
MARISHA: Hi guys!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.591
MATT: Hello everyone!

00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:21.361
MARISHA: Hello!

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:24.420
MATT: Random impromptu road trip chaos!

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.251
MARISHA: Yes, sort of random impromptu road trip
chaos. I apologize if we lose you at any point

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:42.612
because we don't have a lot of service sometimes
driving through the hills of California.

00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:46.881
MATT: The California hills that hate driving and
phone, apparently. I don't know.

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:57.829
MARISHA: Yes. All of those things. Yeah. We were
kind of bored. I guess not that bored.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.301
MATT: I wasn't bored. She was bored.

00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:08.512
MARISHA: No! That's not true at all! I'm not
bored. We have done this drive a few times,

00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:08.949
though.

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:13.692
MATT: Yeah. It's a really pretty drive when it's
during the day. All the pretty stuff we'd get--

00:01:13.692 --> 00:01:22.461
MARISHA: Well, let me see-- there we go. It's
pretty. It's a nice pretty sunset right now, look

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.600
at that! West coast, best coast.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.731
MATT: At times and places. East coast, best coast:
other times and places.

00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:38.930
MARISHA: Yeah. You've got the mountains. So yeah.
There's Matt. Yeah.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.590
MATT: (silly groaning)

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.980
MARISHA: Making faces while driving as always.
Yeah.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.740
MATT: (singing) Sweet charity!

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:09.480
(music)

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:22.936
MARISHA: These clouds-- look at that! Look at
those clouds in the distance. May-- get some rain.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:29.718
MATT: (singing) Poison from a cup of gold, your
gift keeps on giving

00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:31.386
MARISHA: We don't really have anything to talk
about right now.

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:37.406
MATT: (singing) And giving!

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:38.438
MARISHA: Is this Mister Bungle?

00:02:38.438 --> 00:02:51.377
MATT: Yeah, it is Mister Bungle. (singing) Perfect
photographs on Everest days and postcard nights.

00:02:51.377 --> 00:02:52.989
WAZE: Police reported ahead.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.234
MATT: Police reported ahead.

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:55.218
MARISHA: Traffic!

00:02:55.218 --> 00:03:02.126
MATT: Traffic's not too bad so far. That's not
true. It's been expected for the day before

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:05.746
Thanksgiving. There's been that.

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:08.977
MARISHA: There's traffic now, which you can see.
You got to wait for it.

00:03:08.977 --> 00:03:13.177
MATT: You're just going to-- actual drive is.

00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:23.622
MARISHA: There we go. This is when it gets fun
because we get to-- two lanes, three lanes, and

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.820
then any time there's a wreck, it completely stops
all traffic.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.352
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:35.041
MARISHA: And there's nothing you can do, and
there's no roads around it. But it does look

00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:45.423
really ominous. I'm just going to keep showing
people the clouds because-- funny. Oh no! It was

00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:46.050
an accident.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.311
MATT: (Strongbad voice) Driving on the wrong way.

00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:51.509
MARISHA: I'm like those people!

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:53.279
MATT: You are!

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.351
MARISHA: I know! Filming an accident.

00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:57.460
MATT: You're terrible.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.470
MARISHA: I'm one of them!

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.251
MATT: Everyone else doing good? Everyone else
enjoying their pre-Thanksgiving chaos, hopefully

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:04.319
out of work early?

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:13.981
MARISHA: There's a camper. Look at that! Look at
that camper! The Bounder. Uh-huh. There's some

00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:19.298
mountains. That house. Someone lives out there.

00:04:19.298 --> 00:04:20.140
MATT: Heck yeah.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:28.710
MARISHA: That's what always, like, look at this.
There's nothing around, we've been-- like an hour

00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:36.611
outside of the city. There's been outside of town.
That person is an hour outside of civilization.

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:37.362
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:38.580
MARISHA: No matter--

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.290
MATT: For some people, that's the perfect escape.
I couldn't function like that for a long time, but

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.930
heck man, some people are just done with inner
city life. You're like waking up and this is

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.389
outside your window. That makes sense to me.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.741
MARISHA: Yeah. I like to do that for a few days
out of the year.

00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:03.029
MATT: It depends on where you are in your life,
too. In the later years, you might enjoy it more,

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.541
I don't know. Anyway.

00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:08.190
MARISHA: That makes sense.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.211
MATT: I have not seen the Civil War trailer yet. I
have not had time. I want to. I probably will

00:05:14.211 --> 00:05:15.710
tonight, I guess, when we get there.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.742
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess.

00:05:17.742 --> 00:05:24.509
MATT: For those who haven't seen the awesome gif
that went up today of Marisha dropping her pencil

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.541
during last game. It was one of my favorite gifs
of the internet. Well done, Critical Role--

00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:36.511
MARISHA: Sometimes you forget that you're
on-camera. Is this Pogo?

00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:37.616
MATT: That was Pogo, yeah.

00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:47.068
MARISHA: Wait, turn it up. Okay, so there's this
DJ. DJ, I guess? Music artist guy. Who makes--

00:05:47.068 --> 00:05:52.901
MATT: Think he's Australian, he's a very young
guy. He made a whole album of songs mixed from

00:05:52.901 --> 00:06:03.654
audio clips and beats and stuff mixed together
from the original Disney Alice in Wonderland. It's awesome.

00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:06.864
MARISHA: Yeah, the Disney mixes. He does Disney
mixes, and he also does Skyrim mixes.

00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:08.523
MATT: His Skyrim mix is awesome.

00:06:08.523 --> 00:06:14.633
MARISHA: Yeah, love his Skyrim mix! So great. This
is one of the Alice in Wonderland mixes, which is amazing.

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:19.075
[music with heavy drum beat]

00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:20.636
MATT: I'm seeing a bunch of questions.

00:06:20.636 --> 00:06:26.663
[music with heavy drum beat]

00:06:26.663 --> 00:06:32.485
MARISHA: I'm just going to mix the music instead.
I'm sure people have questions, but music.

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:36.922
MATT: Marisha learns eventually to Periscope
properly.

00:06:36.922 --> 00:06:43.845
MARISHA: Hey, Periscope isn't necessarily about
answering questions, though, right?

00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:44.435
MATT: No.

00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:47.755
MARISHA: Right now, I am making this Periscope
about Pogo.

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:49.063
MATT: I know.

00:06:49.063 --> 00:06:54.594
MARISHA: Because I want to because it's my
Periscope and I'm <i>allowed.</i> These people tuned

00:06:54.594 --> 00:07:00.284
in, so they're going to have to listen to us talk
about Pogo for a second.

00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:01.494
MATT: I should go to the Skyrim one.

00:07:01.494 --> 00:07:10.944
MARISHA: Yeah, go to the Skyrim one. Oh hello from
San Diego, hello from everyone on the west coast.

00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:14.143
Yes, Pogo. Here's--

00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:28.852
MATT: All different sound effects and character
sounds.

00:07:28.852 --> 00:07:37.433
MARISHA: All from Skyrim. It's amazing. And it's
awesome and-- around here?

Skyrim. No, you haven't done--

MATT: No, unfortunately, no, not yet. Technically,
you can't say anything. No, I was not in Skyrim,

00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:13.605
made me sad. I want to get in a big Elder Scrolls
franchise at some point. My friend, Michael Gough,

who you guys would know him as the voice of

yours for a day," that sort of hint of a Norwegian
he keeps around for all his characters for this

00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:53.773
franchise. He's all over Skyrim. I based a lot of
my "Norwegian dialect" off of him.

00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:55.074
MARISHA: Nords!

00:09:55.074 --> 00:09:59.231

too many variations."

MARISHA: Nords.

00:10:02.012 --> 00:10:06.171
MATT: He's all over this song, so I got to send
him the MP3 of this song and he was like, "Wait,

00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:11.041
"what?! There's a song with my voice from Skyrim?!"
He was really excited about that.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:25.091
MARISHA: (laughs) Someone asked if we keep
soundproofing foam in our car. So not normally. We

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:34.170
just bought a new sound booth, like a portable
sound booth, and we transported the booth and just

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:40.061
shoved the booth in the corner in the garage for
right now because we haven't had time to actually

00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:46.482
set it up. We put up a bunch of extra foam that
goes inside the booth in the backseat and haven't

00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:51.171
had time to get it out. So now it's coming to San
Francisco with us!

MATT: Travels light.

00:11:03.878 --> 00:11:05.318

MATT: It's absorbent.

now under the cloud that we were driving into.

00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:27.251
Hang on. There it goes. Yeah, look at that! Looks
like we're driving into Mordor!

00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:38.721
MATT: One does not simply drive into Mordor. Not
with 10,000 men could you do this. It is sheer folly.

MARISHA: All we have are some fucking eels.

movie.

00:11:46.378 --> 00:11:54.688
MARISHA: Yeah. For those asking, I have family in
San Francisco and Oakland area.

00:11:54.688 --> 00:11:56.827
MATT: That I've never met.

00:11:56.827 --> 00:12:03.537
MARISHA: That Matt's never met. He's going to get
to see some of my crazy cousins and my crazy

California aunt and uncle. Yeah.

haven't been to.

time to necessarily respond to everyone, but we do
try and read everyone's messages. So thank you so

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:59.391
much! Yes, I'm pretty sure Liam did break Twitch
on Thursday. It got dark! It got dark so fast! We

00:12:59.391 --> 00:13:03.008
drove under a raincloud and it got visibly darker
in here!

MARISHA: It's so crazy!

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:15.994
MATT: Pitch black. We drove into some Stephen King
novel. That'd be bad. (evil laugh)

00:13:16.402 --> 00:13:21.662
MARISHA: It's great because the brake lights lit
up right as that happened, so you had a nice red glow.

00:13:21.662 --> 00:13:24.715
MATT: Yes, it did! (evil laugh)

00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:25.902
MARISHA: So good!

MARISHA: (laughs)

00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.993
MATT: Bakersfield and Fresno: both as ominous as
this looks right now, by the way, for those who

00:13:33.993 --> 00:13:35.093
haven't been there.

00:13:35.093 --> 00:13:38.483
MARISHA: Yeah. Bakersfield!

00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:39.413
MATT: No!
