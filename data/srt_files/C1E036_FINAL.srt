00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,043
MATT: Hello, everyone and good evening. Welcome to
Critical Role, a show where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:08,936
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. This will be our final

3
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:13,660
episode for the year before we take our holiday
break, and for those of you who aren't currently

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,272
in the theater to see Star Wars or are not
planning to leave in the next five minutes to go

5
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:22,061
see Star Wars, which we do not begrudge you that
whatsoever; many of us will be rushing off after

6
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:27,117
this to do the same. For those of you staying with
us, thank you for kicking it and may the Force be

7
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,146
with you when this is over.

8
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:35,789
So before we get started, let's go ahead and get a
few announcements out of the way. One, for those

9
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,687
of you who have been waiting extensively, because
I know you have been. Tomorrow, on the website you

10
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:43,754
will have the Snugglelord playlist will be
premiering on GeekandSundry.com.

11
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:48,151
ZAC: It's completely serious!

12
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:49,639
MATT: It's totally serious.

13
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:50,757
MARISHA: So serial.

14
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:53,002
MATT: Super serial, guys. Like, so serial.

15
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:54,576
TALIESIN: For real-real, not for play-play.

16
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:59,511
MATT: (laughs) The next announcement, we had our
Critmas article go up earlier this week, our

17
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:04,187
Critter's Guide to Critmas, where we each talk
about the different charities that we represent

18
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:10,667
and if you want to try and give something to the
show and the goodwill we put out for that, it's a

19
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:16,794
really great way to see what each of us would like
to see presented or supported by the community. So

20
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:21,447
if you haven't had a chance, go check it out and
feel some holiday spirit to give, go ahead and

21
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:24,475
pick any that are there or any of your own
charities and do what you can to help. So,

22
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:31,770
appreciate that guys. Also, the most recent comic
went live for our Winter's Crest festival.

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,976
LIAM: It's a good one.

24
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:34,310
LAURA: It is a good one.

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,837
TALIESIN: Grog pranking.

26
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:36,823
MARISHA: Grog pranking.

27
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:38,913
TALIESIN: Everybody loves Grog pranking.

28
00:01:38,913 --> 00:01:42,571
LIAM: It's a flight of fancy. It did not happen in
our game. It should have, but it didn't.

29
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:47,020
MARISHA: Yeah. It's art imitating life.

30
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,066
TALIESIN: We had to fluff it up a bit.

31
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:52,622
MARISHA: There was fluffing. Just a little
massaging.

32
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:55,595
TALIESIN: Especially for you, we had to, we had to
fluff.

33
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:57,013
MATT: The two fluffers.

34
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,664
MARISHA: Three.

35
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:05,840
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, so go check it out, it's a
lot of fun and plays into our Winter's Crest

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,263
festival this evening, though that one took place
a year ago in game technically. Two years, I

37
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:16,677
guess, in game-- no, it was a year because the
original-- and all the events that transpired

38
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:20,705
after that, there was the make-up Winter's Crest
festival. You don't know what we're talking about,

39
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,158
but you may soon.

40
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,419
TALIESIN: Just act like you know.

41
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,108
MATT: Which, speaking of which, we have a little
gift for you guys at the break today. We're going

42
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:31,928
to have an extended mid-way break because we have
a gift that we've all put together for you that I

43
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:33,115
think you'll enjoy.

44
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,147
TALIESIN: It's cool.

45
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:35,331
LAURA: It's so exciting.

46
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,182
MATT: So, look forward to that.

47
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:40,822
MARISHA: So no peeing today. No pee breaks.

48
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:43,427
TALIESIN: Like Star Wars, just hold it until it's
over.

49
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:47,613
MATT: Or be like me, just put in a catheter
beforehand, works out really well. Don't do that,

50
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:56,625
don't do that. Please don't do that. (laughs)
Thanks for the support, guys. And Wyrmwood Gaming.

51
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,328
Liam, if you want to go grab that real fast?

52
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:02,671
LIAM: Wyrmwood Gaming, they make gorgeous,
beautiful gaming boxes. They make lovely Christmas

53
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:09,414
presents and if you use the code CritRole, you
will not have to pay for shipping on your Wyrmwood

54
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:11,275
Gaming order. They're gorgeous.

55
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:18,559
TRAVIS: Smells like twenties. Natural twenties.
I'm working on it. I'm polishing.

56
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:21,769
TALIESIN: Keep workshopping that.

57
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,221
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm working on it.

58
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:24,652
MATT: We'll have a Sam here with us shortly.

59
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:25,734
LAURA: Oh, Sam is here.

60
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:26,761
TRAVIS: I'll go get him!

61
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:27,912
MATT: Very shortly.

62
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:31,135
LAURA: Go, Travis, run like the wind!

63
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:35,850
LIAM: Clarence! Bring the gnome in, Clarence!

64
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:42,369
MATT: I guess while we're waiting for him--
(laughs) Travis is going to be really

65
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:44,051
disappointed.

66
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,330
(laughter)

67
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,879
LIAM: Ah, Grog pranked again!

68
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,985
SAM: It's okay, I'll go get Travis.

69
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:58,273
TALIESIN: (sings Benny Hill theme)

70
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:06,095
MATT: This is the rest of our show tonight. Just
three hours of this. It's going to be great. So,

71
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:08,214
if you want to show the cookies that--

72
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:16,732
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. My girlfriend made cookies
for-- I'll put this one on the--

73
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:17,869
MATT: On the mat, here?

74
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:19,075
LAURA: I took a picture.

75
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,936
MARISHA: Hold them closer to the camera. Hold them
to the sky.

76
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:26,713
LIAM: Wow, that was what that camera was purchased
for.

77
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:28,381
MATT: This is now officially the cookie cam.

78
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:32,508
LAURA: Raise them up, Taliesin. Raise them to the
air. Closer to the camera.

79
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:35,954
MATT: How do--

80
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:39,934
LAURA: You want oh wah ta goo.

81
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,591
MATT: How do Pike do this?

82
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,594
MARISHA: (laughs) How do Pike do this?

83
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:46,946
MATT: How do Grog do this?

84
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:53,622
LAURA: They're so cute. There's little baby
Trinkets.

85
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:57,746
TRAVIS: It's really pretty. And it makes it hard
to eat.

86
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:03,138
MARISHA: I like the little gingerbread, with
little lederhosen and they got little goats and

87
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:04,540
reindeer in lederhosen.

88
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,085
LAURA: This is exciting, you guys.

89
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:07,938
MATT: Travis. Can you let Sam in for me?

90
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:09,591
TRAVIS: He's already here.

91
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:10,762
LIAM: Christmas TPK.

92
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:12,401
MARISHA: Oh, look at that Keyleth one!

93
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,943
LAURA: But they're so cute, I don't want to eat
it.

94
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,459
MATT: All righty.

95
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,617
LAURA: I'll have a snowflake, please.

96
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:24,515
MATT: Any other announcements you wish to make, or
shall we go onward?

97
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:32,982
TRAVIS: Any other announcements we should make,

98
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,108

LAURA: Oh! You know what, I do have something.

100
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:37,878
LIAM: What's that?

101
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:42,485
LAURA: Glitter Force. It's a new show.
It's going to be on Netflix tomorrow. So I play

102
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:44,301
the main girl, so that's exciting.

103
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,492
MARISHA: Oh, that's awesome.

104
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:46,679
LAURA: It's great for little girls.

105
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,920
TRAVIS: (muffled) Super cute and funny.

106
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,126
LAURA: Yeah it is, it's adorable and it's funny.

107
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:50,597
LIAM: And 25-year-old guys.

108
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,362
LAURA: And 25-- whoever wants to watch it.

109
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:54,341
MARISHA: Are they going to make the next Bronies?

110
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:59,787
LAURA: I don't know, but there are like a lot of--
I mean, it's called the Glitter Force. There are a

111
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:01,593
lot of cute little make-up accessories.

112
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,015
LIAM: I already have all the merchandise.

113
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,754
LAURA: Yeah. I'm touching every cookie in this
box.

114
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:09,293
MATT: How very Vex of you (laughs).

115
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:12,061
TALIESIN: There's also some whipped cream if you
want to dip.

116
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:13,024
LAURA: Yes.

117
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,940
MARISHA: Touch all the whipped cream, too.

118
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,280
MATT: And on that note.

119
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,436
(laughter)

120
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:27,378
MATT: Let us go ahead and bring our way into this
evening's game. So, to-- hey!

121
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:28,522
TALIESIN: Sorry.

122
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:33,812
MATT: It's all good. Sam will show up; it's fine.

123
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:37,770
TRAVIS: It's like the devil. Say his name and he
will appear.

124
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,726
SAM: I couldn't find Travis anywhere.

125
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:42,818
LIAM: Cookie icing on your lips.

126
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:47,679
TRAVIS: You look like you literally came from the
set of Mad Max. Did you just witness?

127
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,227
LIAM: Glam rock.

128
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:53,463
TRAVIS: Did he tell you he loved you, or what?

129
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:54,930
SAM: They had me eat--

130
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,938
LAURA: Oh, I know what it is. Okay.

131
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,283
SAM: Some stuff.

132
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:04,027
TALIESIN: Scanlan stocking cookie there.

133
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:05,100
SAM: Oh, that's so nice.

134
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,887
MATT: That's adorable. All right.

135
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,278
TRAVIS: We're locked in!

136
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:16,253
MATT: Let's do this. Bring it in. So, to get you guys
up to speed quickly, for those of you who are

137
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:23,194
coming in fresh. Oh, what an episode to jump into.
So, the intrepid group of adventurers known as Vox

138
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:29,447
Machina had made their way to the city of
Whitestone, a town that Percival here grew up in

139
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:34,370
and had taken from him and his family five years
ago, most of his family, the de Rolos, being murdered

140
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:41,012
in the process. The Briarwoods, who had taken the
town rather quickly and covertly held it for five

141
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:47,562
years had now been building toward some sort of a
ritual, some sort of event that the party was

142
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:52,031
investigating. They incited a rebellion within the
city of Whitestone, gathering the remaining

143
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:55,818
members to take up arms and fight against this
undead scourge that had kept them locked down for

144
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,519
so long, oppressed for so long.

145
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:04,467
After managing to take out some of the various
operatives under the Briarwoods' regime, they made

146
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:09,414
their way into Castle Whitestone itself, saved
Percy's sister, Cassandra, thought dead for a long

147
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:16,329
time, got vengeance upon a number of individuals
that were on his List, except for Ripley, who got

148
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:23,116
away. Fought their way down underneath the city of
Whitestone, fell into an acid-based trap, made

149
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:27,321
their way to the ziggurat, this construct beneath
the city of Whitestone, where some ritual was

150
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:34,367
attempting to be completed by Lady Delilah
Briarwood. It was discovered that the patron they

151
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:41,906
spoke of, the Whispered One, had been in previous
bits of history spoken as Vecna, a powerful lich

152
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:46,564
of ancient history that had attempted to ascend to
godhood at some point in the past.

153
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:59,558
They managed to tackle the Briarwoods, destroy
Sylas, defeat Delilah, and dragging them back,

154
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:07,100
decided to interrogate. In the process of trying
to extract information, Percy's dark harbinger,

155
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,662
his dark passenger, if you will... who was a
tongue-waggling dog for a moment.

156
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:15,186
TALIESIN: I was making an evil shadow.

157
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,710
MATT: I see.

158
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,175
TALIESIN: Evil shadow.

159
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:22,907
LIAM: "Kill them all, Percy. Kill them all."

160
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:26,350
MATT: Pressured to incite the
vengeance that apparently the pact he made with this

161
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:33,601
entity required. Upon fighting its will, it was
jettisoned from his form and the party battled

162
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,792
this deranged greater smoke demon-like entity in
the center of this cavern. During this fight, Lady

163
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:42,911
Briarwood tried to escape, however, found a dagger
in the middle of her back,

164
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,367
thanks to Vax over there.

165
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,413
LAURA: Good job.

166
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:50,805
MATT: Stripped of her possessions, and then
Cassandra dragging her into the nearby acid baths,

167
00:09:50,805 --> 00:10:00,357
tossing her body within to leave her story to a
definite conclusion. Scanlan, being very astute,

168
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:03,788
apparently, in some observations, and as
convincing as he can be, managed to wrestle

169
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:09,331
Percy's weapon, his List, his Pepperbox, from his
grip, and tossed it into the very acid pits,

170
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:17,024
destroying his greatest creation and in doing so,
seemingly breaking whatever hold this shadow demon

171
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,606
had on Percy's soul.

172
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:21,308
SAM: The Way of the Gun.

173
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:25,111
TRAVIS: The Quick and the Dead.

174
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:28,615
LIAM: A couple weeks in detox and you'll be fine.

175
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:30,181
MARISHA: It's true.

176
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,368
LAURA: It was an intervention, Percy.

177
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,144
SAM: Had to be done.

178
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:37,916
MATT: Upon returning to the city of Whitestone,
they found the rebellion was successful. The

179
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:46,416
undead hordes had fallen to the blades of the
surviving rallying warriors of Whitestone. Keeper

180
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:51,869
Yennen, who currently was the, essentially, leader
of the rebellion while you guys were going into

181
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:55,990
the castle, met with you. You guys were brought to
the center of town, where you began to see the

182
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,549
rest of Whitestone emerge: the families, the
children, the people that had been too scared to

183
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:05,916
go outside finally came out to celebrate victory,
the first real breath of free air they've had in

184
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,742
five years since the Briarwoods took the city.

185
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:16,337
Some justice was doled to a few survivors of the
Briarwoods' regime. And you were asked to stay

186
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:22,105
behind to help rebuild and prepare for the coming
Winter's Crest festival, of which you agreed. A

187
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:30,506
few awkward moments and a few delightful bits of
interpersonal comedy brought you guys to this

188
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:38,295
point and now we begin tonight's session of
Critical Role. So, to start off, leading up to

189
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:45,658
this Winter's Crest festival, about a two-week
period, what would you guys like to individually

190
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:47,513
do in this time to prepare for the festival?

191
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:48,631
TRAVIS: We have two weeks?

192
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,511
MATT: Yeah, essentially. The two-week period, we're doing
a bit of a time jump here, so if there's anything

193
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:54,949
in particular you want to do or attempt in this
time period, now's the time to do so before we get

194
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:56,311
to the actual event.

195
00:11:56,311 --> 00:12:03,248
TRAVIS: I had a question. Could I go around
lifting up various wagons and maybe ponies,

196
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:07,465
working out to try to increase my strength?

197
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:10,108
(laughter)

198
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:13,611
TRAVIS: Or just randomly picking shit up and not
have an excuse for it. That was good, too.

199
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:18,184
MARISHA: I mean, the town's in tatters. You could
be productive and pick things up.

200
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:21,480
TRAVIS: Yeah! Or you know, I pick up a
hammer in the morning.

201
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,074
LAURA: And you're helping to rebuild.

202
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:25,241
TRAVIS: Yeah!

203
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,218
SAM: Like Rocky IV.

204
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:27,049
TRAVIS: Yeah!

205
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:33,551
MATT: Yeah, in a brilliant holiday montage, as the
cold weather finds its way into the valley of

206
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:42,241
Whitestone, Grog goes around aiding many of the
groups repairing and reassembling the glory of

207
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:45,636
Whitestone, finding the structures that are broken
or destroyed and trying to clean them, prepare for

208
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:52,172
new building properties. You come by, eagerly
lifting, carrying, dropping, slamming, and holding

209
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:58,543
in place extremely heavy pieces of stone and
masonry. In some cases, putting a few of the local

210
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:06,089
strong men to shame and some of the local ladies,
very blush-worthy in your presence. You are very

211
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,102
happy. Go ahead and make three strength checks for
me.

212
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:16,802
TRAVIS: Oh shit, three of them. That's a 24.

213
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:18,923
MATT: Okay, second one?

214
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,218
TRAVIS: That's a 22.

215
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,685
MATT: All right.

216
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:27,028
TRAVIS: 22. 24, 22, 22.

217
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:31,698
MATT: Through the process of these two weeks, not
only have you managed to surprise the local

218
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:37,687
denizens of the city with your feats of strength
and masculine physique-- as when Grog is building,

219
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,297
Grog does so shirtless.

220
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:46,080
TRAVIS: (laughs) As anything. Might as well get a
show out of it.

221
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,577
MATT: In doing so, some of the local denizens pull
some cash to the side to thank you for your

222
00:13:53,577 --> 00:14:00,460
efforts. You find at the end of the week you are
granted a small pouch which contains 315 gold

223
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,617
pieces as a thanks from the locals for all the
help both in the rebellion, the freeing of

224
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:09,254
Whitestone, and for your feats of magnificent
musculature.

225
00:14:09,254 --> 00:14:12,768
TRAVIS: I don't feel like I should take this.

226
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:15,019
LAURA: You should take it.

227
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,729
TRAVIS: It's a lot of money.

228
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:17,938
LAURA: You should take it.

229
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:22,479
TRAVIS: How about you refill my cask of ale
instead?

230
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,008
SAM: Ooh.

231
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,840
LIAM: Happy Festivus.

232
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,964
TRAVIS: And you give me one gold piece so Vex
doesn't kill me.

233
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:36,632
MATT: The crowd look among themselves and one of
the lead architects for this whole endeavor nods

234
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:41,747
to you. "Sounds like a fair trade. If you're
certain, sir."

235
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:46,887
TRAVIS: I'm a very stringent businessman. Do
hurry before I change my mind.

236
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,531
MATT: Gold piece is in your hand faster than you
have a chance to-- you chip a tooth.

237
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:55,527
TRAVIS: I don't understand this practice. It
tastes like shit. Tastes fucking horrible.

238
00:14:55,527 --> 00:15:00,513
MATT: Two casks of their precious ale roll up to
the base of your foot.

239
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:01,769
TRAVIS: (gasps) Two?!

240
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,963
MATT: Two.

241
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:09,148
TRAVIS: One for each arm, eh? All right, the one
that I have, I'm not stopping, until it's

242
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:13,563
completely empty. Bring your goblets and cups.
It's time to get fucked up.

243
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:17,506
MATT: (laughs) Fantastic. All right, Vex.

244
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:23,361
LAURA: Well, I got the ring and the bracers that I
need to get checked out, see what they are.

245
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:25,337
MATT: And the robe?

246
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:29,004
LIAM: Oh, the robe. No, I threw it down, though.

247
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:30,474
TALIESIN: You picked it up.

248
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:31,658
LIAM: You picked it up.

249
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:32,810
LAURA: I have the robe, too.

250
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,717
MATT: Okay.

251
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:35,980
LAURA: We left her naked. Yes, we did.

252
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,538
MATT: You kind of did, actually.

253
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,059
TALIESIN: Like properly.

254
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:46,070
MATT: A few things here, actually.

255
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,912
TRAVIS: Oh Vex, I made gold.

256
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:54,627
LAURA: Oh wow, thank you, that's amazing, Grog.
Where did you find this piece of gold?

257
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:57,801
TRAVIS: Oh, I got it for fixing a bunch of shit
around town. Are you going to taste it?

258
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:02,626
LAURA: No, I'm not. It's already got a lot of
drool on it, actually.

259
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,288
TRAVIS: But how do you know if it's gold if you
don't taste it?

260
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:08,370
LAURA: I'm just going to put it in with the rest
of the gold, Grog.

261
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:16,401
TRAVIS: Shit. I'm going to pull one over on her
one of these days. Can you make things look like

262
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,772
they're gold?

263
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:18,768
SAM: I can, actually.

264
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:19,692
TRAVIS: You can?

265
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:20,918
SAM: Yes.

266
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:22,214
MATT: All right.

267
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,933
TRAVIS: I've had my thought for the day, there's
nothing else.

268
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,492
SAM: When you have the punchline, let me know.

269
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:32,099
TRAVIS: It's a standby TV symbol right now. That's
all I got.

270
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:36,710
MATT: So, as you take some time, first off, I want
you to go ahead and roll an investigation check.

271
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,896
LAURA: Aw man, I've got to roll for this? I'm
going to roll one of my new dice.

272
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:45,069
Well, it's for--

273
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:47,716
MATT: What was that sound?

274
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,806
LAURA: It was exciting! 24.

275
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:55,347
MATT: 24, okay. So as you begin pulling out the
items and begin separating, before you can even

276
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,932
begin the initial inspection, as you are pulling
the robe out, you find there is a slight poke.

277
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:02,386
There's something thin--

278
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:04,505
LAURA: (singing) Feel a little poke coming
through.

279
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:10,640
MATT: Not that kind of poke. You unravel that part
of the robe and find there's a long deep pocket on

280
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,197
the inside of the robe. And inside, there's a long
gnarled piece of deep maroon wood that is carved

281
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:18,619
into a wand shape.

282
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,448
SAM: What kind of a wand?

283
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:27,957
MATT: I'm trying to find the actual item card
here. Found it! There we go.

284
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:35,078
SAM: I want it.

285
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:38,052
LAURA: Oh my god.

286
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:39,269
SAM: I want it.

287
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:43,778
LAURA: Oh, did you find it? Did you find it in the
group? Are you even standing near me right now, as

288
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:44,946
I'm seeing this wand?

289
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,983
SAM: Of course I am. I'm always with you.

290
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,238
LAURA: How do you know I'm not doing it in my
room?

291
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:51,069
SAM: Are you?

292
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:51,812
LAURA: Yes.

293
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,125
TALIESIN: What's she wearing right now?

294
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,073
SAM: Why I am in your room?!

295
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:58,249
LAURA: Scanlan, get out of here, I'm naked.

296
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:03,727
SAM: Oh I know, I came in here to tell you, to ask
you something: where's my wand?

297
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:07,677
(laughter)

298
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,840
LAURA: Ugh, I've got to look at this a bit more
before I give this to you because it is very, very

299
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:20,734
good. It is a Wand of Fireballs, by the way,
people. It has seven charges; while holding it,

300
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:26,423
you can use an action to expend one or more of its
charges to cast the Fireball spell, DC of 15, one

301
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:30,181
charge you cast at third level-- so many words. I
don't even understand.

302
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:35,438
LIAM: A fan art of this moment, please?

303
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:37,635
LAURA: But also--

304
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:42,306
MATT: You recall, actually, as you went over the
top at the initial battle with Lady Briarwood,

305
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,542
that was what she pulled out and managed to blast
all of you with at once when you all were on the

306
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,628
top of the temple.

307
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:48,701
LAURA: Nice. I'm just going to put this in my
pocket.

308
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:50,780
LIAM: I thought you were naked.

309
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,894
LAURA: I'll put it in the pocket of the outfit I'm
about to put on. And then the ring and the

310
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:57,855
bracers?

311
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:00,290
MATT: I'll get those right now. There you go.

312
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,259
LAURA: Wait, Grog, don't sit down.

313
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:03,655
TALIESIN: This is why it's Christmas.

314
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:04,799
SAM: Where's my ring?

315
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,442
MARISHA: What's the ring do?

316
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:08,732
LAURA: Oh my god. I found so many amazing things,
you guys.

317
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:12,287
TRAVIS: Those are bracers--

318
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,288
LAURA: No!

319
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,642
SAM: Those are mine. I found them.

320
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:17,212
TRAVIS: Grog will believe whatever you say.

321
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:25,608
LAURA: No! I'm reading them all; they're mine!
Ring of Lightning Resistance. Who wants a Ring of

322
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:28,173
Lightning Resistance?

323
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:32,340
SAM: Sure.

324
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,933
LAURA: Bracers of Defense. Who needs extra
defense? You're really weak. Your AC's super low,

325
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:38,824
isn't it?

326
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:39,666
LIAM: It is.

327
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,439
MATT: Bracers of Defense will technically only
really benefit anybody who's not wearing armor.

328
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,564
LIAM: Not wearing armor?

329
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:44,411
MATT: Correct.

330
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:45,225
MARISHA: Like Grog?

331
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,207
MATT: Like monks.

332
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:47,896
LAURA: There you go.

333
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,411
LIAM: Thank goodness, because he is a blushing
flower in the wind.

334
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:57,092
MATT: If you currently have-- is it an amulet that
helps your armor? We'll go through your AC and

335
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:59,330
find out if it overlaps with any other benefits.

336
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,731
TRAVIS: I do have the Amulet of Armor.

337
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:04,060
MATT: Right, so basically that would replace that
and you would now have an amulet slot open for any

338
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,523
sort of future enchantment stuff.

339
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:07,886
LIAM: I'll take the amulet.

340
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:10,078
MATT: You could give the amulet to somebody else if
you want to.

341
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,017
LIAM: He'll never give it to me.

342
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:17,031
MARISHA: He was willing to do it until you gave
him the idea to not do it.

343
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:18,170
LIAM: That's fine.

344
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,722
TRAVIS: Can't remind me of these things.

345
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:23,214
LAURA: Okay, a Robe of Shielding Shadows. Can it
be worn with armor?

346
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:24,642
MATT: No.

347
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:31,211
LAURA: Oh man. It's just a robe. It's her dress,
basically, and it gives you resistance to piercing

348
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:32,540
damage.

349
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,019
LIAM: You know what we can do with that? Sell it.

350
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,574
SAM: Or give it to me.

351
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:38,318
LAURA: You have armor, dude.

352
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:39,772
SAM: Oh, okay.

353
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,040
MARISHA: It takes an armor slot.

354
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,431
LAURA: And it's a woman's robe.

355
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:44,592
SAM: I can make that work.

356
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:45,941
LAURA: Yeah, you totally could.

357
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:53,018
MARISHA: Can we take the fabric and sew it into a
nice afghan or something?

358
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:57,972
MATT: You can certainly try. It would probably
ruin the enchantment.

359
00:20:57,972 --> 00:21:01,857
LAURA: Oh, it would ruin the enchantment? If you
sew it differently?

360
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:06,011
MARISHA: What if you don't cut into it?

361
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:08,565
LAURA: What if we fold it?

362
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,508
TALIESIN: What if we just tie the dress around our
neck?

363
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:14,700
LAURA: Maybe just put your arms through it and
then let it ride behind you like a cape?

364
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,115
MARISHA: Right, it's like one of those "wear nine
different ways" dresses?

365
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:23,569
MATT: You can wear it however you want and you
will discover one way or another if it actually

366
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:24,944
gives an effect.

367
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:30,101
LAURA: Well, I'm just going to pocket this because
we may sell it, how about that. And then, a Ring

368
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:34,634
of Lightning Resistance, anybody want it? How many
rings can we wear at one time?

369
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:35,967
MATT: Two. One on each hand.

370
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:38,050
TALIESIN: I would not say no to a Ring of
Lightning Resistance.

371
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,353
LAURA: Pass that over to Percy.

372
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:42,348
TALIESIN: I've got plans. At the moment, it's the
only way to charge my glove.

373
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:49,607
LAURA: All right, and this Wand of Fireballs? I
feel like Scanlan needs it more than anyone else.

374
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,393
SAM: I already have a wand that shoots things.

375
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,256
LIAM: You're the only one who can use it.

376
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:56,137
SAM: Oh, I'm the only one who can use it? I'll
take it, then.

377
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:59,625
LAURA: I might just sell this robe, though.

378
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:05,314
TRAVIS: I know how you work it, it's swish and
flick. Fireball.

379
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:08,012
LAURA: Swish and flick.

380
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:09,842
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

381
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:14,887
TRAVIS: What if a non-spellcaster uses a wand?
Nothing, right?

382
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:17,634
LAURA: No. Anyone can use it.

383
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:18,849
TRAVIS: Should we try it?

384
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:20,195
LIAM: Yes, you should try it.

385
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:26,356
TRAVIS: I am a walking crash test dummy. I mean,
we can try it. It'll be fine.

386
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:29,774
MATT: That's my favorite mindset.

387
00:22:29,774 --> 00:22:33,111
LAURA: And then I'm going to mostly for the rest
of the time, keep to myself and Trinket and I'm

388
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:35,381
going to help the townspeople rebuild a bit.

389
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:38,879
MATT: All right. Wondrous. Vax?

390
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:47,590
LIAM: I am also going to keep to myself and I'm
going to talk to the people in town, see what

391
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:54,197
businesses are open or trying to open, see what
they need. And I would like to talk to Percy,

392
00:22:54,197 --> 00:23:02,165
since I don't know anyone here, about who I could
talk to about getting messages to Emon, and I

393
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:09,927
would like to get a message to Gilmore, to see if
he can fill any need here. If trade is so ruined

394
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:16,998
here, that Gilmore could be a help. And Gilmore
gets another front, a place to do business and

395
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:19,443
actually do good in a place that needs it.

396
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:20,984
MARISHA: Gilmore's Glorious Books.

397
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:21,922
SAM: That's right.

398
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,428
LAURA: I like it.

399
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:30,365
MATT: Over bits of a period of discussion, for the
most part, any sort of non-official courier

400
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:36,026
service has been negated in the town. However,
there is now a glut of people that are, after the

401
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:42,724
devastation, especially the ensuing rebellion,
folks that need work and need coin and there are

402
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:46,976
many individuals that would be more than willing
to, for a handful of gold coins, make the journey

403
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:49,469
to Emon delivering any messages you like.

404
00:23:49,469 --> 00:24:03,788
LIAM: Well, I will write a message to Gilly and
say that they're hurting here. They need trade, all the

405
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:09,876
supplies that he's able to supply and tell him
that this town is about to explode and is

406
00:24:09,924 --> 00:24:11,945
definitely a good place for his wares.

407
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:16,765
LAURA: Are you going to break up with him in the
letter too? Are you going to tell him that you're

408
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:21,202
going to break his heart as soon as he writes you
back? Is that what's going to happen? I'm sorry,

409
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:23,303
I'm just looking at your letter as you're writing
it.

410
00:24:23,303 --> 00:24:27,777
LIAM: No, because I've been avoiding her as well.
I'm avoiding everybody except for Percival, who

411
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:29,308
I've been asking advice from.

412
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:33,742
MATT: Okay. Do you also have the cloak? Did you
take the cloak?

413
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:36,928
LIAM: I have the cloak, yeah. Yeah, dibs on that.

414
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:44,208
MATT: Fine pickings off the corpses of the two
major villains of the previous arc.

415
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,345
LIAM: Yes.

416
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:48,402
TALIESIN: More corpse picking to do.

417
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:50,090
MATT: Exactly.

418
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:56,716
LAURA: What?! You have so many cloaks, though. Why
do you need another one?

419
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:58,700
SAM: He's opening a cloak factory.

420
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,466
TALIESIN: Gilmore's Glorious Cloaks.

421
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,670
MATT: Cloak hoarding over here. All right,
Scanlan.

422
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,725
SAM: I wanted to do four things.

423
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:09,164
TRAVIS: Yeah!

424
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:19,764
SAM: One, compose an epic poem to commemorate the
rebels rising up against the empire that had kept

425
00:25:19,764 --> 00:25:29,554
them down for so long. Sort of a force that had
awakened. I call it...

426
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:31,372
Resident Evil. 
I don't know why.

427
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:36,365
Because they're residents and there was evil.
I couldn't come up with another name for it.

428
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:44,041
They're residents of the town and there was an
evil. That's all. So, I'm looking for a

429
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:45,105
publisher.

430
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:48,810
MATT: Okay, good. There may be a grand opportunity
at the Winter's Crest festival to perform this.

431
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,941
SAM: Oh-- gulp.

432
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:53,895
LIAM: Disney and Capcom will be calling.

433
00:25:53,895 --> 00:26:03,069
SAM: I also wanted to make sure that we were using
the treasury, coordinating with Percy to open a

434
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:08,669
library for the people to help them rebuild their
place, which sounds like Vax is already on. I also

435
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:18,204
commissioned a portrait of myself. I don't know if
you-- I found a young artisan in town that I paid

436
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:24,311
him some coin to paint me something that could
possibly hang in the keep, at Greyskull, in the

437
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:25,692
dining room.

438
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:32,876
MATT: Okay. After asking around for a few days,
you manage to discover there is a budding local

439
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:35,732
artist who doesn't really believe in his artwork.
He currently works in the stables on the far

440
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:41,740
southwest side of town. But people have seen some
of his work and tried to bolster him, so you're

441
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,082
sent in his direction and as you get there, you
can see him. He's currently in the process of

442
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:49,383
actually cutting through one of his recent works
he wasn't happy with and he's violently tearing

443
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:53,763
through it. As you step into the stable, he stops
and puts it off to the side.

444
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:56,834
"Sorry, sir, can I help you?"

445
00:26:56,834 --> 00:27:06,249
SAM: Ah, hello. My name is Scanlan Shorthalt. I
was the leader of the rebellion that just defeated

446
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,089
Lord and Lady Briarwood.

447
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:13,348
MATT: "Oh! The pleasure is mine." He is now
averting his gaze and almost bowing his head like

448
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:17,907
you're royalty. He's very flustered and flushed by
the sudden appearance.

449
00:27:17,907 --> 00:27:25,014
SAM: I hear you are a budding artist and I am, if
nothing else, a supporter of the arts.

450
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:33,117
MATT: "My talents are far unrefined and nowhere
near powerful or

451
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:35,416
"decent enough for your attentions."

452
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:45,515
SAM: Well, I believe in you. And I need you for a
very important commission. A great good has been

453
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:52,589
done here by the rebels, by the townspeople, with
the help of Vox Machina and of course, with the

454
00:27:52,589 --> 00:28:01,401
help of Vox Machina's leader, myself. Therefore,
I'm here to commission a humble portrait of

455
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:10,311
myself. You may not know him, but there was a folk
hero in my town growing up. His name was Fabio. He

456
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:18,548
would frequently pose with windblown hair and an
open shirt on a horse. I was thinking something

457
00:28:18,548 --> 00:28:24,391
like that, and also I have this figure of Pike.
She's a friend of mine. I'd like her on the back

458
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:30,816
of the horse, arms around my waist, looking super
hot. If that's possible.

459
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:39,442
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Only because he's
so down on his own skills.

460
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:40,549
SAM: 33.

461
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:42,227
(laughter)

462
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:49,133
MATT: As you're telling this tale, he goes from
bashful and meek to staring off in the distance,

463
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,665
the artistic inspiration rolling through his
head.

464
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:56,342
SAM: Oh. Sorry, 31. I was wrong.

465
00:28:56,342 --> 00:29:02,179
MATT: Unchanged. He begins finishing your
sentences as you're describing scenery and

466
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,903
extrapolating on it. You can see the artistic mind
is definitely spinning. He looks to you and goes,

467
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:11,709
"It would be my honor. Please." He reaches forward
and takes your gnomish hand and you know, you're

468
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:16,428
about two and a half feet shorter than him, but
he's still very humble, kneels down and says,

469
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:20,723
"I would be honored to do this portrait. 
No charge."

470
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:24,658
SAM: Please, I insist. I must give you something
for your troubles.

471
00:29:24,658 --> 00:29:28,568
MATT: "Whatever you deem fit, Sir Gnome, but I--"

472
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:31,338
SAM: What's your name, young sir?

473
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:32,433
MATT: "Jameson."

474
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:33,441
SAM: Jameson?

475
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:36,051
LIAM: I like him.

476
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:37,154
SAM: I like this guy.

477
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:40,390
TRAVIS: I think everybody does-- until they
don't.

478
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:51,907
SAM: How about in return, I will sing your praises
far and wide as the greatest artist in-- where are

479
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:56,670
we? Whitestone. Whiteheart. Briarstone.
Heartwood.

480
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:06,339
MATT: In making that mention, his openness
suddenly closes off and he withdraws. You see this

481
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:15,171
fear in his eyes and he shakes his head. "That
would be untrue and I am but a simple stablehand.

482
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:18,523
"I can do this for you, but please, if you could
keep this between us."

483
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:23,963
SAM: All right. I'm aware that some people like to
be discreet about things and that's all right with

484
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:29,160
me, too. Then I'll pay you the going rate for
portraits of me.

485
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,313
MATT: "Certainly. How large would you like it?"

486
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:35,844
SAM: How big is the wall at Greystone Keep?

487
00:30:35,844 --> 00:30:37,193
MATT: Depends on which area.

488
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:39,753
SAM: The dining room wall.

489
00:30:39,753 --> 00:30:43,718
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's like Sistine Chapel!

490
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:47,950
MATT: Your dining area's probably about 12 to 15
feet high.

491
00:30:48,143 --> 00:30:50,591
SAM: High? Okay, and wide?

492
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:56,147
MATT: Wide? I'd say, off the top of my head,
somewhere between 40 and 50 feet.

493
00:30:56,147 --> 00:31:05,822
SAM: Well, I'd like to leave room for other
artwork, as well. We'll say 20 by six.

494
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,452
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laughing) 20 by six?

495
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:14,349
SAM: Well, it's half and half. 20 wide, six high.

496
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:21,592
MATT: His eyes go wide and he nods and says, "This
is a challenge. But I believe I do know someone

497
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:28,508
"whom I can order such a grand canvas from. This
can be done. This can be done." And you see he

498
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:31,533
smiles and takes your hand once again. "This can
be done."

499
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,448
SAM: Thank you, sir. Jameson, was it?

500
00:31:33,448 --> 00:31:34,482
MATT: "Jameson, yes."

501
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:40,429
SAM: You have done a noble deed for your people
and for the rebel forces.

502
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,780
MATT: "Eclipsed by the deeds you have done, Sir
Gnome."

503
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,406
SAM: Oh, that is true.

504
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:46,889
(laughter)

505
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,583
MATT: He rushes off to prepare himself.

506
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:55,507
SAM: And then, one last thing. On a serious note,
I do some research to see if me, or any one of my

507
00:31:55,507 --> 00:32:04,326
party could, over time and with great effort,
learn the skills required to utilize a

508
00:32:04,326 --> 00:32:06,356
teleportation circle.

509
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:08,598
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an arcana check.

510
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:15,584
SAM: Not great. Arcana? 11.

511
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:20,130
MATT: Yeah. What little you know of
teleportation-based magics, which is not your

512
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,591
forte in your bardic experiences, but what you've
heard and what you've seen, while you've traveled

513
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:27,679
with Tiberius, and you've come across other
individuals that used the arcane spells that

514
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:35,547
caused transport, teleportation circles themselves
are a very specific ritual. It's a spell that

515
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:41,198
comes from within the arcane caster's capabilities.
If you yourself do not have that, you're not going

516
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:43,489
to be able to utilize it at a drop of a hat.

517
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:49,559
After asking around, you find there once was a
teleportation destination circle in Castle

518
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:54,343
Whitestone that was part of the network of
Tal'Dorei, in Emon, but has since been destroyed

519
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:58,051
and sundered and has been for quite some time. You
imagine probably when the Briarwoods came, it was

520
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:06,590
deemed a dangerous little loose thread. So, over
the period of the next week or so, best you can

521
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,549
ascertain is that type of transportation here is
going to be probably not likely, at least not with

522
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:13,845
the resources you have at your disposal. You may
have to travel elsewhere.

523
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:15,433
SAM: It's not a skill I can learn?

524
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:19,181
MATT: It's a spell you could learn, but that would
be something you would have to swap out as you

525
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:21,802
level up or choose as your spell progression down
the road.

526
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:22,684
SAM: All right.

527
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:26,281
LIAM: I find it's better to travel the world
rather than use fast travel.

528
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,544
LAURA: I agree. You see so much more of it.

529
00:33:28,544 --> 00:33:29,855
LIAM: You miss everything.

530
00:33:29,855 --> 00:33:30,798
LAURA: Yeah.

531
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:32,004
MARISHA: All the artistic--

532
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:34,245
LIAM: Every nook and cranny, yeah.

533
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:37,342
MATT: But you do, as part of your group's
discussions throughout the week, discover that

534
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:41,664
Keyleth does have long-transport capabilities.

535
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:45,017
SAM: Ooh, hello Keyleth. Fly the friendly skies.

536
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:48,178
MATT: You want to explain what you can do?

537
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:54,721
MARISHA: I have Teleport via Plants. So I can bamf
through the Sun Tree. We can all--

538
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:56,531
SAM: We can all?

539
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:57,699
MARISHA: We can all.

540
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,445
LIAM: You mean like a big plant?

541
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:00,858
MATT: It opens for six seconds, a portal--

542
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:06,788
MARISHA: For one round, I can be like, this tree
is a portal and we walk through the tree and it

543
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:10,230
goes to another tree as long as I know of
that tree's existence.

544
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,025
LAURA: And it's the same size, right? It has to be
something of the same size?

545
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:14,076
Or it can be any tree?

546
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:16,560
MARISHA: It has to be walkable body-size.

547
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,351
MATT: A large or larger tree as far as this size.

548
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,428
LAURA: Trinket and Grog-sized trees.

549
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:26,117
SAM: That sounds like it would be the quickest
"root" to go.

550
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:27,762
TALIESIN: (groans)

551
00:34:27,762 --> 00:34:33,248
LIAM: Is there a tree in your garden back at
Greyskull?

552
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:36,089
MARISHA: There is. I made sure there was a nice--

553
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:37,980
LAURA: Big old fatty tree.

554
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,466
MARISHA: Big old fatty oak tree.

555
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:47,865
MATT: There's actually two large trees, I
believe, in the Sarenrae temple.

556
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:52,716
LAURA: I forgot to say what else I wanted to do.

557
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,246
MATT: What else do you want to do?

558
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:58,561
LAURA: Well, because of that flying potion, I
wanted to try to do some research and see how much

559
00:34:58,561 --> 00:35:02,735
flying potions are, if there's any kind of items
that can make you fly whenever you want?

560
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:05,364
TRAVIS: She liked it.

561
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:06,957
LAURA: I really liked it.

562
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:10,399
MATT: (laughs) The first taste is free.

563
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:16,051
LAURA: I know. I mean, I know the carpet's gone,
but maybe there's like an individual sort of item

564
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:20,860
that's less expensive than a flying carpet, I
don't know. Just wondering.

565
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,256
MATT: You still have the flying potion--

566
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,034
LAURA: I downed it!

567
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:30,916
MATT: Right, the card I gave you for it. Because
that would contain

568
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,658
the cost of that particular one.

569
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:33,765
LAURA: Oh.

570
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:34,979
TRAVIS: 5,250.

571
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:36,303
LIAM: You have a robe.

572
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,202
LAURA: Well, but I want a bunch of them, though.

573
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:42,867
MATT: Which you can have made or possibly look
about to have purchased. This town is pretty thin

574
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:43,882
as far as--

575
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:44,768
LAURA: Magic stuff?

576
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,296
MATT: Yeah. Most of anything of worth, of an
arcane nature was confiscated and utilized or

577
00:35:50,296 --> 00:35:54,892
essentially melted down for its residuum
components as part of the creation of the

578
00:35:54,892 --> 00:35:59,049
ziggurat, in preparation for their ritual. So,
other than the items you were given when you first

579
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:04,100
arrived here, you're hard-pressed to find anything
in this town of that type. But asking around,

580
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:09,870
there are enchantments that can gift flight, but
they're pretty rare.

581
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,023
LAURA: Okay.

582
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:13,095
LIAM: Talk to Gilmore.

583
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:17,701
MATT: Gilmore would be the person to talk to about
that. You good, Scanlan?

584
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:18,984
SAM: Oh, I'm good.

585
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:20,283
MATT: All right. Keyleth?

586
00:36:20,283 --> 00:36:26,222
MARISHA: Well, Keyleth is very confused as to why
everyone seems to be avoiding each other. It's

587
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:35,587
odd. Everyone's so standoffish. Anyway, Keyleth is
going to go help the farmers and try and maybe

588
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:45,593
help revitalize some of the land and help with
planting crops, and helping out there. She also

589
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:54,177
wants to make sure all the local kids are taken
care of. Any kids that lost their parents in the

590
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:58,715
rebellion. Lead the charge of making sure the kids
are taken care of.

591
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:05,918
MATT: Okay. Going around, there were a number of
casualties in the town as part of the rebellion.

592
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:12,493
It unfortunately happens in warfare, regardless of
how noble a cause it may be. There are a few

593
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:18,829
families that were left fatherless or motherless,
as there was quite a share of the sexes raising up

594
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:25,618
for this battle. So the children that-- no one
that you know of lost both parents, for the most

595
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:30,376
part. There was the intent that if there were a
parental unit, that at least one had to stay in

596
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:35,680
case of such an occurrence to raise the children.
But you go out and meet with some of the families

597
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,508
and make sure they're taken care of.

598
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:41,300
Some of the homes that were destroyed as part of
the rebellion, you and Grog both worked together

599
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:50,164
to help make sure the process of rebuilding goes
well. You do also help the farmers begin to right

600
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:55,422
their crops and revitalize the land, which had
been drained by the necromantic essence of the

601
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:59,241
Briarwoods' presence, and whatever the ziggurat
was pulling from the land itself beneath seems to

602
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:08,296
have released its hold on the immediate vicinity.
So, through your aid specifically, being a druid

603
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:13,910
of your nature, you prepare this for probably one
of the finest harvests that Whitestone has had in

604
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:19,184
quite a long time. Even though it is deep winter,
they're already seeing early spring growth through

605
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:20,835
your aid.

606
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:24,219
MARISHA: Dope. Climate change.

607
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:30,517
MATT: I know, it's crazy. Vegetation and
vegetables that are withstanding and still able to

608
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:34,867
grow through the frost in the mornings, as the
cold weather is coming from the winter, so you're

609
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:39,266
raising quite a strong crop. Well done.

610
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:42,120
MARISHA: We'll have Thanksgiving in about nine
months.

611
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,986
MATT: (laughs) There you go.

612
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:46,447
TALIESIN: For the orphans, man.

613
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:47,551
MARISHA: For the orphans.

614
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:48,809
MATT: Percival?

615
00:38:48,809 --> 00:39:00,313
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to spend most of my time
organizing the affairs of the castle and the local

616
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:06,913
government and making sure that there's
institutions in place, getting rid of anybody who

617
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:11,771
might still have sympathies towards the
Briarwoods. Helping re-establish the

618
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:16,576
Zenith and the Ladies' Chamber. Spending some time
with my sister.

619
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:26,823
MATT: On that note, before you continue, there is
no current institution in place. Anyone of any

620
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:35,777
political power outside of Archibald, you, and
Cassandra, has been slaughtered long past. So in

621
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:40,412
these discussions, you talk with Keeper Yennen,
you talk to Cassandra, and there is an air of

622
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:44,847
understanding that right now, there is this period
of peace, this period of calm, but there has to

623
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:49,904
eventually be an establishment put into place:
some sort of political head to oversee the

624
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:54,455
rebuilding of the city and the continued growth
and survival of this town proper.

625
00:39:54,455 --> 00:40:04,311
Cassandra confides in you multiple times that she
is nervous, that she, especially given recent

626
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:11,736
circumstances, her recovery of her Stockholm
syndrome with the Briarwoods, is not confident

627
00:40:11,736 --> 00:40:20,039
that she would be able to lead on her own. There
is a moment where she apologizes extensively to

628
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:26,280
Archibald. Archibald, who did survive, and was her
direct contact in the castle, takes a few days

629
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,762
before he will even face Cassandra when he is told
that she essentially had been leading him astray

630
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:36,553
and spearheading the death of the previous
rebellion. You also discover the reason the

631
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:42,845
various new nobles that were prepared for your
ambushes were because Cassandra had gotten

632
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:47,845
information about that from Archibald and then fed
it to the Briarwoods. But you do sense a very,

633
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:55,169
very deep-seated regret and an urge to make amends
for that from her. And because of that

634
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:59,918
circumstance, she doesn't feel like the people of
Whitestone, who would have this information, which

635
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:03,777
you haven't told anyone. There is no large-scale
announcement. The only people that know about

636
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:11,211
Cassandra's current situation with the Briarwoods
are you guys, Keeper Yennen, and Archibald.

637
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:13,202
SAM: Archibald's still around?

638
00:41:13,202 --> 00:41:14,428
MATT: He is.

639
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:15,777
SAM: And he betrayed us?

640
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:17,168
LAURA and MARISHA: No.

641
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:18,858
LAURA: Cassandra betrayed him.

642
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:20,305
LIAM: Cassandra played everybody.

643
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:23,480
SAM: Oh. All right, I'll let him live.

644
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,015
LAURA: Thank you, glorious leader. Thank you.

645
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:30,418
SAM: Just part of the team, guys.

646
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:36,607
MATT: So that is an ongoing discussion. As far as
establishing the structure, there's been many

647
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:40,465
talks, but nothing has been fine-tuned, and that
may play itself out as part of the festival.

648
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:47,021
TALIESIN: I have two items that I would like to
look at. Well, I have three items that I would

649
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:51,672
like to look at. Sylas's sword and his amulet.

650
00:41:51,672 --> 00:41:55,616
MATT: Okay. The brooch that he left behind.

651
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:56,874
TALIESIN: Brooch!

652
00:41:56,874 --> 00:41:58,607
MATT: Travis has got you.

653
00:41:58,607 --> 00:41:59,781
TALIESIN: Really, Travis?

654
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:01,199
LAURA: He's our runner.

655
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,881
LIAM: Oh, ho ho ho, and all of that!

656
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:06,791
LAURA: What is it?

657
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,151
MARISHA: What is it, what is it?

658
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,151
TALIESIN: Damn.

659
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,670
LAURA: Is it amazing?

660
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,932
LIAM: He's standing there like Guile before a
Street Fighter match.

661
00:42:12,932 --> 00:42:15,762
MATT: He hasn't heard of that character.

662
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:21,073
LAURA: (laughs) What is it? What do you have?

663
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:30,210
TALIESIN: I don't know, it's a piece of paper.
It's pretty cool. It's called a Brooch of Living

664
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:37,632
Essence and it basically masks the wearer's
alignment, essence, whether they're good or evil,

665
00:42:37,674 --> 00:42:40,381
they can't be seen by Detect Magic spells.

666
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:42,288
LIAM: That is the worst thing for you.

667
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:44,614
LAURA: Not anymore!

668
00:42:44,614 --> 00:42:45,879
TALIESIN: Is it?

669
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:49,091
LIAM: I'm unsure. It's hard to tell.

670
00:42:49,091 --> 00:42:54,561
MATT: You gather that this item in particular was
used by Sylas to travel through magically

671
00:42:54,561 --> 00:43:00,896
protected areas without giving up his undead
essence or being read for his true intentions.

672
00:43:00,896 --> 00:43:07,054
MARISHA: It's for a shifty bastard. It's
definitely a shifty bastard thing.

673
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:08,726
LAURA: It's for Scanlan.

674
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:10,543
SAM: Oh, me? My alignment's good.

675
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:14,284
MARISHA: Yeah, but it could be good if you want to
pretend to be evil.

676
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:19,565
TALIESIN: Either this or Vax. This would be an
interesting thing for either--

677
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:26,178
MARISHA: It doesn't protect you against Detect
Magic spells. It protects you against Detect Good

678
00:43:26,178 --> 00:43:29,863
or Evil spells and magic spells that reveal your
true nature.

679
00:43:29,863 --> 00:43:32,266
SAM: True nature.

680
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:34,518
LIAM: It would be a good thing.

681
00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:36,231
LAURA: So you could pretend to be bad.

682
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:41,915
TALIESIN: What do you have in your-- brooch?

683
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:43,591
LIAM: My brooch?

684
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:44,701
MATT: It's in the neck slot.

685
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:46,805
LIAM: Nothing.

686
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:48,257
TALIESIN: Nothing in your neck slot?

687
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:50,100
LAURA: That sounds so disgusting.

688
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,946
LIAM: My neck slot (laughs). I don't know, Percy.
What have I got in my neck slot?

689
00:43:54,946 --> 00:44:04,585
MATT: You see the brooch slowly press deep in his
neck slot (laughs). God. Ugh. Don't turn that into

690
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:06,645
any fan fiction, please.

691
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:08,072
TALIESIN: Don't say that!

692
00:44:08,072 --> 00:44:09,758
MATT: I know. Percy, what else?

693
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:10,748
TALIESIN: The sword.

694
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:11,856
MATT: The sword.

695
00:44:11,856 --> 00:44:15,282
SAM: That is a big piece of paper.

696
00:44:15,282 --> 00:44:18,547
LIAM: That's a rather big piece of paper for a
sword.

697
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:21,796
TALIESIN: And Ripley's gun.

698
00:44:21,796 --> 00:44:30,210
MATT: Well, first, as you take the sword in your
hands, the large, thick obsidian, onyx black blade.

699
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:37,722
You take a while to, not necessarily attune to it,
but put enough of your attention towards it where

700
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:49,093
you sense its magical capabilities. As it begins to
clarify, where one voice before was not there, a

701
00:44:49,135 --> 00:44:51,198
new voice speaks and says--

702
00:44:51,198 --> 00:44:52,355
MARISHA: Wait!

703
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:55,411
LIAM: (shushing noises) This is important.

704
00:44:55,411 --> 00:44:57,267
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

705
00:44:57,267 --> 00:45:00,427
MATT: "You, are you my new wielder?"

706
00:45:00,427 --> 00:45:01,657
LAURA: What?

707
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,186
SAM: He's got a talking sword!

708
00:45:03,186 --> 00:45:05,323
MARISHA: What's with you and fucking weapons,
man?

709
00:45:05,323 --> 00:45:11,543
TALIESIN: (whimpers)

710
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,886
LAURA: Be strong, Percy!

711
00:45:13,886 --> 00:45:18,185
LIAM: You're not here.

712
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:19,416
TALIESIN: No.

713
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,160
(laughter)

714
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,357
MATT: "Then leave me until one worthy lifts this
blade."

715
00:45:25,357 --> 00:45:27,128
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently put it down.

716
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:29,143
MATT: Okay.

717
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,559
MARISHA: This is a sword that has a name!

718
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:37,795
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do about this
(laughs). This is really disturbing.

719
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:43,052
MATT: As you step away from the blade, you can
feel the air nearby is generally colder in its

720
00:45:43,052 --> 00:45:49,631
presence, and where previously it was just a
weapon, you can almost feel like there's something

721
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:54,737
looking at you. There's a presence just bent
towards you, expectantly.

722
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:56,240
LAURA: That's creepy!

723
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,206
TALIESIN: (whimpers)

724
00:45:58,206 --> 00:46:00,663
SAM: Just try it out! What could go wrong?

725
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:03,308
LIAM: Do you want to become evil, Grog?

726
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:05,241
TRAVIS: I can tame it.

727
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:09,284
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow--

728
00:46:09,284 --> 00:46:10,971
LIAM: Don't do it, Percy.

729
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:15,193
TRAVIS: What does it say?

730
00:46:15,193 --> 00:46:17,384
LAURA and SAM: What does it say?

731
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:19,621
TALIESIN: I don't think I should tell any of you.

732
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:26,854
MATT: The blade sits there on the ground where you leave
it, whatever you wish to do with it.

733
00:46:26,886 --> 00:46:31,709
TRAVIS: Do you want to put it in the Bag?

734
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:36,674
TALIESIN: God, you've given me so much to think
about. It's really unfortunate. I'm definitely

735
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:39,281
going to take at least a week of our two weeks to
think about the sword.

736
00:46:39,281 --> 00:46:41,917
MATT: Okay. What are you going to do with it in
the meantime?

737
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:43,283
LIAM: Sleep on top of it.

738
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:45,819
TALIESIN: Sleep on top of it. It's in my room.

739
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:47,346
TRAVIS: You don't want it in the Bag?

740
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,069
TALIESIN: No.

741
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:54,471
MATT: So, for each evening as you lay down to
sleep, you can feel a voice creep back in to say--

742
00:46:54,471 --> 00:47:10,552
The voice is inquisitive. "I'm useless left here.
I seek the thrill of battle. I'm hungry." Other

743
00:47:10,552 --> 00:47:19,491
evenings, it comes to you, almost pleading. "Why
have you forsaken me? You took me as a trophy.

744
00:47:19,491 --> 00:47:26,658
"What purpose has a blade that goes unused? I will
remember this."

745
00:47:26,658 --> 00:47:30,777
Then it falls silent after a few days.

746
00:47:30,777 --> 00:47:33,221
TRAVIS: The silent treatment.

747
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:35,489
LAURA: It's sulking.

748
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:40,328
TALIESIN: Is it a two-handed sword or a
one-handed sword?

749
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:46,331
MATT: It's a greatsword. It's two-handed, big old
Final Fantasy 7 sword.

750
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:49,007
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

751
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:52,720
SAM: Evil Grog is not a good idea.

752
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,393
MARISHA: This is the thing that's fucked up.

753
00:47:55,393 --> 00:48:03,768
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, which is why I shouldn't
have given him that brooch. Goddamn it. I may ask

754
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:05,985
for that brooch back.

755
00:48:05,985 --> 00:48:07,209
LIAM: You can certainly try.

756
00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:08,275
TALIESIN: God damn it.

757
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:10,155
TRAVIS: (laughs) Whoa.

758
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:15,582
MATT: So, as you think on it, the weeks pass--

759
00:48:15,582 --> 00:48:17,918
TALIESIN: No, I had a--

760
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:19,386
MATT: Oh, what did you guys want to do?

761
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:22,981
TALIESIN: I also wanted to work on Ripley's gun.

762
00:48:22,981 --> 00:48:29,697
MATT: Right. The gun itself is essentially a
baseline pistol. If you look in your archetype for

763
00:48:29,697 --> 00:48:34,976
your fighter class of gunslinger, the pistol
mechanics all apply to that weapon. Beyond that,

764
00:48:34,976 --> 00:48:38,762
nothing in particular. It's just her first
successful attempt in recreating a firearm.

765
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:46,027
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to start making some
ammo for it. And I'm going to work on it.

766
00:48:46,027 --> 00:48:47,152
MATT: Okay.

767
00:48:47,152 --> 00:48:51,886
LAURA: Percy, whenever you get a chance, could you,
maybe-- how hard are those exploding arrows to

768
00:48:51,934 --> 00:48:55,111
make? Super-duper hard?

769
00:48:55,111 --> 00:49:00,763
TALIESIN: Not terribly difficult. I don't think
it's in two weeks, but when we go home, I'll work

770
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:18,527
on it. I know, I like them too... I hate you.
You're a terrible person.

771
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:20,986
MATT: You picked up the sword, man.

772
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:22,768
TRAVIS: Percy, how's that sword working out?

773
00:49:22,768 --> 00:49:23,997
TALIESIN: It's a little big, actually.

774
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:28,203
TRAVIS: Is it? Look, I have this one-handed
Dragonslayer Longsword if you want to get used to

775
00:49:28,203 --> 00:49:33,499
a bit of badassery before you move up to the big
leagues. I know you've got that dinky piece of

776
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,004
shit you've been using this whole time.

777
00:49:35,004 --> 00:49:40,027
MATT: Just as a note, too, a greatsword is a
strength-based melee weapon. Dex does not play

778
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:40,869
into it.

779
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:42,476
TALIESIN: Oh, which is-- well, yeah.

780
00:49:42,476 --> 00:49:47,413
MATT: Based on whatever your strength is. What's
your strength, Percy?

781
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:49,250
TALIESIN: Strength is 12.

782
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,100
MATT: You would probably not do very well with
that.

783
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,655
TALIESIN: Which is why I was thinking about having it
cut down and melted down into something more

784
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:58,841
useful.

785
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:00,502
MATT: This is also viable, if you wanted to try.

786
00:50:00,502 --> 00:50:07,284
TRAVIS: (whispering) Dragon-slayer Longsword.

787
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:15,665
TALIESIN: You know, this is actually pretty badass
if I did give it to Grog. Yeah.

788
00:50:15,665 --> 00:50:17,084
TRAVIS: Trade!

789
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:21,809
MARISHA: Jesus Christ! And he's not even going to
say anything about it. You're a terrible person,

790
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:28,527
not Matt, you are. He gave you the device and you
used it!

791
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:32,358
LIAM: You've been playing D&amp;D for years. You know
what this means!

792
00:50:32,411 --> 00:50:35,741
TALIESIN: I'm going to let you know we should keep
an eye on him, just in case.

793
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:43,997
MATT: So, Grog. As you take up the blade in your
hands, you hear coming out of the ether, a gentle,

794
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:51,738
low velvet voice caresses the inside of your head
saying, "You, are you to be my wielder?"

795
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:53,744
TRAVIS: What the shit?

796
00:50:53,744 --> 00:50:58,115
MATT: "Speak your name, warrior."

797
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:01,740
TRAVIS: Grog.

798
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:07,839
MATT: "Warrior Grog, have you taken up the blade
of Craven Edge?"

799
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:14,214
TRAVIS: Is that what this is? Do you have a female
setting?

800
00:51:14,214 --> 00:51:17,801
(laughter)

801
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:31,488
MATT: You hear a long, drawn-out sigh. "Do you
accept my power?"

802
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:38,276
TRAVIS: There's a power that comes with you? What
kind of power?

803
00:51:38,317 --> 00:51:44,731
MATT: "Do you enjoy drinking the strength of your
foes, watching them beaten before you, and have

804
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:48,901
"that very power become your own?"

805
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:50,470
TRAVIS: Sounds pretty good.

806
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:56,340
MATT: "Do you wish the shadows to encase your form
and grant you resilience and anger, forcing those

807
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,013
"to kneel before you in fear."

808
00:51:59,013 --> 00:52:01,392
TRAVIS: The shadows?

809
00:52:01,392 --> 00:52:08,751
MATT: "Do you accept, Grog?"

810
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:10,024
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

811
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:15,331
(laughter)

812
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:19,767
MATT: "Then it is done. Together, we will
accomplish great things."

813
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:27,174
TRAVIS: Do you have a name? Do I call upon you?
Can I call you Bacon?

814
00:52:27,174 --> 00:52:33,796
MATT: "You call me Bacon and this blade will cut
the very hand you hold. My name is Craven Edge. It

815
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,820
"will do you well to remember that."

816
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:42,401
TRAVIS: Right. Yep. Was totally kidding about the
bacon, Craven Edge. Well, I'm excited about this

817
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:49,508
partnership. Clearly we will be a force to be
reckoned with. By the way,

818
00:52:49,508 --> 00:52:53,458
can other people hear you?

819
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,694
MATT: Silence.

820
00:52:54,694 --> 00:53:00,435
TRAVIS: Shit.

821
00:53:00,435 --> 00:53:02,879
LIAM: He will kill me first.

822
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,775
TALIESIN: It is an amazing sword.

823
00:53:04,775 --> 00:53:06,185
TRAVIS: I haven't even read it yet.

824
00:53:06,185 --> 00:53:07,301
TALIESIN: You haven't read it yet?

825
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:08,890
TRAVIS: No. I can't read!

826
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:12,158
(laughter)

827
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:14,511
LAURA: I want to read it so bad!

828
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:15,945
LIAM: Don't let anybody read it.

829
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:17,599
TALIESIN: It's so magical.

830
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,745
TRAVIS: Give me a bear cookie.

831
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:26,055
MATT: You have a clue as to what it can do based
on when it was used against you by Sylas.

832
00:53:26,055 --> 00:53:28,357
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was badass. Thank you.

833
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:34,392
MATT: So, anything else you want to accomplish
before we close out on the rest of the week?

834
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:35,577
SAM: I had a question.

835
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:36,410
MATT: Yes.

836
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,012
SAM: Did we assemble a team of magic--

837
00:53:39,012 --> 00:53:40,550
LAURA: To take care of the thingy?

838
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,751
MARISHA: Yeah, that we needed to-- we all need to
take care of that.

839
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:45,285
LAURA: The marble of death?

840
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:52,011
MATT: So, throughout the week, Keeper Yennen, a
few of the low-level arcanists that exist here--

841
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:54,114
LAURA: Didn't we send for Eskil Ryndarien?

842
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:58,323
MATT: You sent for him, but you know information
right now travels at the speed

843
00:53:58,323 --> 00:53:59,826
of whatever it is you--

844
00:53:59,826 --> 00:54:00,999
MARISHA: By mule?

845
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:01,755
MATT: Yeah.

846
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:03,067
TALIESIN: At speed of mule.

847
00:54:03,067 --> 00:54:14,179
MATT: The speed of that as it continues forward.
You get word back. Nothing from Allura Vysoren

848
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:19,517
yet. Eskil does respond, saying he is currently
finishing up some personal business, but will make

849
00:54:19,517 --> 00:54:24,448
his way towards Whitestone within a couple
weeks, with some of his compatriots who may also

850
00:54:24,488 --> 00:54:30,598
be of aid. Information has been gotten across, but
it won't be until probably after this festival for

851
00:54:30,598 --> 00:54:32,252
them to begin their investigation.

852
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:37,473
However, in the meantime, Keeper Yennen and a few
of the smaller local arcanists do make a couple

853
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:43,668
trips down to inspect the ziggurat themselves.
When they return, Yennen is at a loss. Most of

854
00:54:43,668 --> 00:54:49,519
them don't quite understand the nature of the
magic there. It seems to be immobile. It seems to

855
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:59,389
be completely either negating, consuming, or
preventing any sort of magical force within a

856
00:54:59,389 --> 00:55:06,861
specific radius of it. A lot of their normal
arcane methods of inspecting or divine methods of

857
00:55:06,861 --> 00:55:14,833
inspecting this site are not functional. This is
more like bring old tomes and research historical

858
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:18,926
records of things that may be similar to this. So
when you bring up that you had reached out to

859
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:22,509
Eskil Ryndarien with the information you had, you
gather that will probably be a much more fruitful

860
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:26,726
endeavor. As of right now, no one has any clue
what this is.

861
00:55:26,726 --> 00:55:32,520
LAURA: And we searched the Briarwoods' library
that they had gathered together that say anything

862
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,589
about--

863
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:34,489
MATT: Yeah.

864
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:35,574
LAURA: Okay.

865
00:55:35,574 --> 00:55:41,413
MATT: Some of the information you acquired from
Scanlan's memory and a little bit of research into

866
00:55:41,413 --> 00:55:49,586
Vecna. Very little information really exists, but
as the keeper of secrets, you get the sense that

867
00:55:49,586 --> 00:55:54,970
most anything of importance in dealing with this
ritual has been destroyed as part of its

868
00:55:54,970 --> 00:56:02,009
preparation because secrets are meant to be kept
and hoarded. So not much luck in that regard,

869
00:56:02,009 --> 00:56:10,326
unfortunately. However, as the second week draws
to a close, the Winter's Crest day comes forward.

870
00:56:10,364 --> 00:56:17,432
As the morning crests into the proper Winter's
Crest festival, you all awaken in Castle

871
00:56:17,432 --> 00:56:23,092
Whitestone to an unusually cold morning. As you
look out, there is a fresh dusting of white snow

872
00:56:23,092 --> 00:56:31,508
that has gently caressed the entirety of this
valley and the entire city itself. You all get

873
00:56:31,508 --> 00:56:36,545
yourselves ready, gather your belongings and
preparing for the festival you've been helping get

874
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:39,925
ready this entire week, you walk down towards
Whitestone itself.

875
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:46,514
As you get to the outskirts of the city, you can
already hear in the distance music beginning to

876
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:51,187
play. Blue and white ribbons are hung up all
throughout the town, on the outside of buildings,

877
00:56:51,187 --> 00:56:57,023
outside of taverns, outside of even the remaining
wreckage that is only partially built. It seems

878
00:56:57,023 --> 00:57:03,460
that overnight, people just went through the town and
decorated whatever needed to be decorated to wipe

879
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:09,791
clean the memory of the recent trials and
difficulty that everyone's undergone.

880
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:14,552
You begin to make your way towards the center of
the town, to the town square where the Sun Tree

881
00:57:14,552 --> 00:57:19,081
is, and as you approach, you now see the source of
the music, as a number of individuals in the town

882
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:22,745
have brought out their instruments. They're
playing, some more discordant than others, but

883
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:27,330
overall, a sense of joy as people for the first
time in a long time are truly embracing this

884
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:33,221
positive atmosphere. You see children laughing and
running through the streets. You can smell

885
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:39,502
fresh-cooked pies and various bakery items just
filling the air around you. Looking over, as you

886
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:45,112
approach the Sun Tree, you can see where once
bodies hung from its boughs, there now are strings

887
00:57:45,112 --> 00:57:49,442
of blue and white ribbons that are intertwined
with each other, braided and set across from

888
00:57:49,442 --> 00:57:54,322
branch to branch. You can see fine little glass
structures that have been hand blown and left to

889
00:57:54,322 --> 00:57:56,680
drape from them to be part of the festivities.

890
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:01,963
As you begin to make your way up there,
immediately people begin to notice your presence,

891
00:58:01,963 --> 00:58:06,558
and you can see people in the streets begin to
gather up and begin cheering. You hear voices

892
00:58:06,558 --> 00:58:11,035
mutter out, "Vox Machina!" People start reaching
out and shaking your hands. "Thank you so much,

893
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:15,434
"thank you." You're taken aback by the attention.
It's reminding you a little bit of the awkwardness

894
00:58:15,434 --> 00:58:17,620
you had with the last Winter's Crest in Emon.

895
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:23,198
LAURA: Be on the lookout for eggs, giant
frosty-looking eggs.

896
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:32,150
MATT: You make your way towards the Sun Tree and
there you see Keeper Yennen is in the process of

897
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:36,130
speaking with a few of the people that helped him
with this entire rebellion, in setting up this

898
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:41,996
event, and he greets you all as you approach. "Oh,
my friends! How wondrous. Glad to see you are all

899
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:44,325
"wakened and ready and well rested, I assume."

900
00:58:44,325 --> 00:58:45,547
TRAVIS: Yes.

901
00:58:45,547 --> 00:58:51,257
MATT: "Glorious. Well, this is a day of
celebration. We've taken the time and mourning

902
00:58:51,257 --> 00:58:59,781
"shall continue as needed, but today, today is to
embrace what it means to be alive, to thwart the

903
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:05,077
"darkness and the evils that press upon the free
folk of these lands. And of course, to eat and

904
00:59:05,077 --> 00:59:07,245
"drink until you are full and drunk."

905
00:59:07,245 --> 00:59:08,776
(laughter)

906
00:59:08,776 --> 00:59:10,531
MARISHA: Cheers to that.

907
00:59:10,531 --> 00:59:17,252
MATT: "It will be a little bit before we get to the
actual celebration speech, but in the meantime, go

908
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:22,441
"free yourselves, drink, be merry. There are a few
events going on around you." And he points in a

909
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:25,975
few directions, and you can see around you there
are tables set up, there are individuals playing

910
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:32,551
games. Immediately to the left, you can see there
are two long tables set up and a stack of pies off

911
00:59:32,551 --> 00:59:34,472
to one side, looks like an eating contest.

912
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:36,884
TRAVIS: I haven't eaten for a full day.

913
00:59:36,884 --> 00:59:39,687
MARISHA: In preparation?

914
00:59:39,687 --> 00:59:40,711
TRAVIS: Yep.

915
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:45,641
MATT: You do see what looks to be a gentleman with
a high box, with a very, very fine waxed mustache

916
00:59:45,641 --> 00:59:50,763
that is currently doing parlor tricks and magical
presentations for people who are trading coin to

917
00:59:50,763 --> 00:59:57,532
be astounded with his illusions. You can see what
looks to be a series of tables behind the Sun Tree

918
00:59:57,532 --> 01:00:04,077
heading towards the southeast side of it. You
recognize better than anyone: these are central

919
01:00:04,077 --> 01:00:07,328
tables, relatively small, with a chair on each
side.

920
01:00:07,328 --> 01:00:08,666
TRAVIS: Arm wrestling!

921
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:12,433
(laughter)

922
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:15,186
TRAVIS: Craven, I think-- oh wait, that's arm
wrestling. Go to sleep.

923
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:20,600
MATT: The sigh is getting more and more
impatient.

924
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,864
TRAVIS: He'll get used to that.

925
01:00:22,864 --> 01:00:29,041
MATT: So these are the three first events you come
across in your immediate vicinity. What would any

926
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:31,188
of you guys like to partake in?

927
01:00:31,188 --> 01:00:35,923
MARISHA: I see the magic tricks and go (loud gasp)
and run over, without saying anything.

928
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:36,821
SAM: I tag along.

929
01:00:36,821 --> 01:00:39,819
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll go in for this one as
well.

930
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:40,712
MARISHA: Okay.

931
01:00:40,712 --> 01:00:43,519
MATT: As you guys rush forward, you come to the
box. It's a relatively high box. It looks like it

932
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:48,071
hasn't seen some use in a while. The gentleman
sitting there, with longish hair, parted in the

933
01:00:48,071 --> 01:00:53,209
center, and combs outward. He's got a waxed
mustache. He's wearing dusty presentational

934
01:00:53,209 --> 01:00:59,571
robes and he has on the top of it a series of
small boxes and what looks like various tricks he

935
01:00:59,571 --> 01:01:05,171
has at the ready. There are three children off to
the side with either their keeper or parents

936
01:01:05,171 --> 01:01:14,575
behind. "Now watch, if you will, as this simple
ball transports itself between the cups and yet

937
01:01:14,575 --> 01:01:19,403
"find your eyes unable to follow." And he switches
the cups around for a moment. (whoosh)

938
01:01:19,403 --> 01:01:23,385
(laughter)

939
01:01:23,385 --> 01:01:27,300
MATT: "Where is the ball, little one?" The kids
deliberate and one goes, "That one!"

940
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,982
"Are you sure?" They all shake their head.

941
01:01:31,982 --> 01:01:38,051
"Oh! I'm sorry,
the ball has escaped your vision once again."

942
01:01:38,051 --> 01:01:40,759
And they all they cheer. He lifts the other one.

943
01:01:40,759 --> 01:01:49,541
MARISHA: (gasps), are you a wizard? We've met a
few wizards. No, are you a sorcerer? Because you

944
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:53,175
don't look like a druid. This doesn't look like
natural magic. What?

945
01:01:53,175 --> 01:02:00,906
MATT: "I am what you refer to as an illusionist.
And I can play tricks on your mind, your mind,

946
01:02:00,906 --> 01:02:01,685
"your mind..."

947
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:05,387
MARISHA: (shouting) No! God, we've been through
way too much of that here lately.

948
01:02:05,387 --> 01:02:06,921
SAM: It's entertainment.

949
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:09,625
MATT: "Playful! Playful illusions, not
against..."

950
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,057
SAM: It's just a game.

951
01:02:11,057 --> 01:02:12,986
TALIESIN: Carry on. It's good. She's good.

952
01:02:12,986 --> 01:02:15,818
MATT: "Keep her in check, please. You're scaring
the children."

953
01:02:15,818 --> 01:02:20,076
SAM: It's not real. It's a game. It's going to be
fine.

954
01:02:20,076 --> 01:02:22,303
MARISHA: (whispers) Okay. I don't trust this guy.

955
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:25,078
SAM: Don't worry. Why don't you have Percival take
the first turn?

956
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:29,989
MATT: "I'm also a diviner. I can look into your
eyes and see your very future."

957
01:02:29,989 --> 01:02:31,571
TALIESIN: Not really. It's okay.

958
01:02:31,571 --> 01:02:38,078
MATT: "For a simple gold piece, you can test your
skills against the transference of this ethereal

959
01:02:38,078 --> 01:02:42,318
"ball. Or for five, I can look into your fate."

960
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:45,483
MARISHA: (starts hyperventilating)

961
01:02:45,483 --> 01:02:47,236
TALIESIN: I'll do both, actually.

962
01:02:47,236 --> 01:02:51,105
MATT: "Ha ha. All right." Takes the gold piece.

963
01:02:51,105 --> 01:03:01,316
MARISHA: I grab him by the scruff and I say, if
you hurt him... You don't know what he's been

964
01:03:01,316 --> 01:03:02,732
through, okay?

965
01:03:02,732 --> 01:03:04,719
MATT: "It's fine. It's all right."

966
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:09,174
MARISHA: Are you working with the Briarwoods? Did
the Briarwoods send you?!

967
01:03:09,174 --> 01:03:10,940
MATT: "Can you please get her off of me?"

968
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:18,146
SAM: Hey, kids, this is why you shouldn't drink
during the daytime.

969
01:03:18,146 --> 01:03:21,504
MATT: "Anyway."

970
01:03:21,618 --> 01:03:23,690
MARISHA: Do your magic.

971
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:31,280
MATT: "So, sir." Takes one gold piece off,
sets it aside. "Now, the ethereal ball. This was

972
01:03:31,425 --> 01:03:39,440
"taken from the Far Realms themselves, crafted in
the ivy-covered hills in the far North End, the

973
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:45,739
"Feywild itself. How could you follow this, with
but your simple vision?" He places one cup over

974
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:49,572
it, two cups to the side and begins shifting and
shifting. Go ahead and make a perception check.

975
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:52,025
MARISHA: Oh, him? Okay.

976
01:03:52,025 --> 01:03:57,696
TALIESIN: 20.

977
01:03:57,696 --> 01:04:06,945
MATT: You see now, there's a couple moments where
the ball shifts between cups and you get a really

978
01:04:06,945 --> 01:04:11,421
close idea of exactly how this works. And when he
finishes, he looks to you.

979
01:04:11,421 --> 01:04:14,792
"Now, where is the fey ball?"

980
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:20,522
TALIESIN: I would say it's to your right, right
there.

981
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:21,754
MATT: "That one?"

982
01:04:21,754 --> 01:04:23,155
(laughter)

983
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:25,896
MATT: "Are you sure? It could be anywhere on this
table."

984
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:32,675
TALIESIN: It could, but it's there. Because it's
not anywhere else other than there.

985
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:34,571
SAM: I'm not so sure about that, Percy.

986
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:36,325
TALIESIN: Well, you're welcome to go in, if you
like.

987
01:04:36,325 --> 01:04:38,189
SAM: I choose the one on the left.

988
01:04:38,189 --> 01:04:39,741
TALIESIN: You'll have to give him a gold coin,
though.

989
01:04:39,741 --> 01:04:41,367
SAM: Sure. (ding)

990
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:42,842
MATT: He takes the gold coin.

991
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:45,429
"Do you wish to choose for this one instead,
then?"

992
01:04:45,463 --> 01:04:48,236
TALIESIN: No, I'm choosing on the right.

993
01:04:48,236 --> 01:04:55,237
MATT: Takes the gold piece. "And with that--

994
01:04:55,285 --> 01:04:56,679
"You found it, yay."

995
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:58,964
(laughter)

996
01:04:58,964 --> 01:05:00,611
MATT: He gives you five gold.

997
01:05:00,611 --> 01:05:05,802
MARISHA: I lean into Percy and I say: this guy's
not a threat. He's okay.

998
01:05:05,844 --> 01:05:08,698
TALIESIN: Well, I am a dark evil demonic
creature.

999
01:05:08,698 --> 01:05:18,043
MATT: As he gives you the five gold, he
immediately takes it back.

1000
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:21,587
"But you wanted to know your fate."

1001
01:05:21,633 --> 01:05:22,936
TALIESIN: Yes.

1002
01:05:22,936 --> 01:05:25,150
MATT: "Step forward, young-- what's your name?"

1003
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:27,801
TALIESIN: Just Percy.

1004
01:05:27,801 --> 01:05:36,320
MATT: "Percy. Please, present your face." As he
reaches out, he begins to feel the bumps on your

1005
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:43,781
head. He begins to touch the outside of your face.
He closes his eyes. "Yes, yes, I can see into the

1006
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:47,664
"very nature of your existence. You, young--
Percy?"

1007
01:05:47,664 --> 01:05:48,674
TALIESIN: Yes.

1008
01:05:48,674 --> 01:05:57,978
MATT: "Percy, Percy. Young Percy. You, you have
hardworking hands, you've seen a lifetime of hard,

1009
01:05:57,978 --> 01:06:06,067
"hard work in the fields. But you wish to make
your father proud, as does every son and you

1010
01:06:06,114 --> 01:06:13,570
"will-- as one day you will become... a well
celebrated smith of horseshoes!

1011
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,364
"Yes! Glory to Percy!"

1012
01:06:15,364 --> 01:06:18,068
SAM: Amazing! So accurate.

1013
01:06:18,068 --> 01:06:19,566
TALIESIN: So accurate.

1014
01:06:19,566 --> 01:06:25,164
MATT: He leans in and says, "I could tell from the
black powder on your hands that you've worked with

1015
01:06:25,164 --> 01:06:27,201
"a few pieces of iron in your time."

1016
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:29,249
TALIESIN: Very astute.

1017
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:36,265
MATT: (chuckles) "Thank you so much. So, who's
next?" The children start rushing up and-- you

1018
01:06:36,265 --> 01:06:37,731
guys wish to continue with this guy?

1019
01:06:37,731 --> 01:06:38,709
MARISHA: No.

1020
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:40,486
(laughter)

1021
01:06:40,486 --> 01:06:42,419
SAM: All right, we'll leave.

1022
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:44,923
MARISHA: I've seen enough.

1023
01:06:44,923 --> 01:06:46,865
MATT: Okay, who's doing what now?

1024
01:06:46,865 --> 01:06:51,851
TRAVIS: Does anyone want to get down to the pie
contest? I thought I might arm wrestle first.

1025
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:53,544
LIAM: I think you should arm wrestle.

1026
01:06:53,544 --> 01:06:55,124
SAM: Oh yeah, I want to see this.

1027
01:06:55,124 --> 01:07:00,279
TRAVIS: I'd like to arm wrestle, in case I need to
eat my way out of sadness with pies.

1028
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:02,180
MATT: (laughs)

1029
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,810
TALIESIN: Turn your sadness into victory.

1030
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:04,646
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1031
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,336
SAM: I will also enter the arm wrestling
competition.

1032
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:07,261
MATT: All right.

1033
01:07:07,261 --> 01:07:08,250
TRAVIS: Yes!

1034
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:16,246
MATT: Okay, okay. So, as you guys step up, you can
see there's a woman dressed in a rather simple

1035
01:07:16,246 --> 01:07:22,630
barmaid outfit, leather apron on her side and
she's pretty thick and rough-and-tumble with her

1036
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:26,882
timbre. She has her hair pulled up in a very tight
bun in the back. She has a bit of a smudge on her

1037
01:07:26,882 --> 01:07:33,142
chin. She says, "All who wish to enter the contest
please step right here, pay your entry fee!

1038
01:07:33,142 --> 01:07:39,227
"Graciously prove your might and your strength.
Show that you yourself are responsible for the

1039
01:07:39,227 --> 01:07:46,350
"rebellion succeeding." Sees you. "You! You wish to
be part of this, yes!"

1040
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,484
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do!

1041
01:07:48,484 --> 01:07:54,975
MATT: "Very well, very well. Ah, entry fee--" She
leans in and gets real for a second. "Entry fee is

1042
01:07:55,023 --> 01:07:59,843
"25 gold pieces each. Winner gets free drinks and
the pot."

1043
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:02,369
LIAM: I slap down 25 gold on behalf of Grog.

1044
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,182
TRAVIS: (excited gasp)

1045
01:08:04,182 --> 01:08:05,154
SAM: You're paying for his entry?

1046
01:08:05,154 --> 01:08:06,531
LIAM: I'm paying for his entry, sure.

1047
01:08:06,531 --> 01:08:07,487
SAM: And mine, as well?

1048
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:08,504
LIAM: No.

1049
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:10,134
TRAVIS: Good man.

1050
01:08:10,134 --> 01:08:15,952
SAM: I would like to-- I would also like to
compete.

1051
01:08:15,952 --> 01:08:24,795
MATT: (prolonged high-pitched giggle) "Sorry. 25
gold then."

1052
01:08:24,795 --> 01:08:26,251
SAM: Here you go.

1053
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:31,357
MATT: "I mean no offense, I just-- it's a cute
beret."

1054
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:35,240
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow.

1055
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:41,582
MATT: Other individuals come and enter and you can
see as you guys are preparing for this event, you

1056
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:47,711
hear the rattling of chains nearby and you can see
two guards stepping up with--

1057
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:49,505
LAURA: The other goliath!

1058
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:54,962
MATT: Goran Vedmeyer, who you've seen--

1059
01:08:54,962 --> 01:08:55,939
LAURA: The Duke!

1060
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:58,029
MATT: Yeah, no longer Duke. Un-Duked.

1061
01:08:58,029 --> 01:09:02,580
LAURA: Once you Duke something, you can't un-Duke
it, Matt.

1062
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:05,817
MATT: No, he's been thoroughly un-Duked, trust
me.

1063
01:09:05,817 --> 01:09:07,987
MARISHA: The Duke that was formerly known as--

1064
01:09:07,987 --> 01:09:09,382
TRAVIS: Duke Gonad.

1065
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:14,775
MATT: Yeah. He's brought by two of the guards and
the guards whisper to each other. They bring out

1066
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:21,484
their own 25 gold pieces and they plop it into the
pot. "He's entering as our proxy." He looks

1067
01:09:21,484 --> 01:09:32,882
around. "Yes, what they said." She gives a nod.
"Well, I don't see why not, I suppose. All right!"

1068
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:37,121
Other people end up gathering up their change and
she goes over the sheet with one of her

1069
01:09:37,121 --> 01:09:42,265
compatriots and they end up breaking off into
teams. There are four tables set up and for this

1070
01:09:42,314 --> 01:09:45,532
round, at least, this part of the festival, they
break up in different parts. She calls out to one

1071
01:09:45,532 --> 01:09:51,858
table. "All right, we have a Jasper Leer to go
against a Scanlan Shorthalt at this table."

1072
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:53,492
SAM: That's me!

1073
01:09:53,547 --> 01:09:54,737
TRAVIS: Yay, Scanlan!

1074
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:56,452
MARISHA: Yes, Scanlan!

1075
01:09:56,452 --> 01:10:06,717
MATT: As you're getting ready, you see a
farmer-type individual. Clean, as dressed as he

1076
01:10:06,717 --> 01:10:10,000
could be in relatively ragged clothes, but he
looks like he's trying to be presentory for the

1077
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:17,723
festival. Grey beard, longish shoulder-length
tousled hair. He walks up, pulling his wrist back,

1078
01:10:17,723 --> 01:10:23,870
and he's got some good muscles. Looks like he's
definitely been working a lot of heavy farmwork

1079
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:29,315
for most of his life. He sits down at the table
across from you, gives you a look over.

1080
01:10:29,315 --> 01:10:31,618
"Well, shall we begin?"

1081
01:10:31,618 --> 01:10:42,772
SAM: Sure. Can I ever-so-covertly say to him, you
don't want to beat a gnome. You <i>don't</i> want to

1082
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:46,981
beat a gnome. I'm casting Suggestion on him.

1083
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:55,874
MATT: I will say, go ahead and make a
sleight-of-hand check.

1084
01:10:55,874 --> 01:11:01,931
SAM: Oh, the worst. Shit. 13.

1085
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:10,398
LAURA: What does it mean? The eyebrows!

1086
01:11:10,398 --> 01:11:12,445
TRAVIS: And the phone came out.

1087
01:11:12,445 --> 01:11:16,782
SAM: Who knows? We'll find out when my arm gets
wrenched off.

1088
01:11:16,782 --> 01:11:18,691
LAURA: Looking at Jasper's stats, I can tell.

1089
01:11:18,753 --> 01:11:21,216
MATT: No, what are you talking about?

1090
01:11:21,216 --> 01:11:23,493
SAM: He's checking Twitter.

1091
01:11:23,493 --> 01:11:34,382
MATT: Yeah, got to respond to a couple-- guys,
give me a second. All right. So, he has his hand

1092
01:11:34,382 --> 01:11:40,756
up, he looks you over with a look of intensity for
a second. "Put your hand up."

1093
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:42,222
SAM: Yes, sir.

1094
01:11:42,222 --> 01:11:53,295
MATT: He clasps his fingers entirely around your
hand at this point. As the intensity mounts, the

1095
01:11:53,295 --> 01:11:58,657
crowd gathers around, everyone begins cheering,
the barmaid steps up again. "All right, two of

1096
01:11:58,657 --> 01:12:11,477
"you, hands together. And prove your strength...
now!" Go ahead and make a strength check.

1097
01:12:11,477 --> 01:12:12,719
SAM: 19.

1098
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,464
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh shit.

1099
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:20,816
MATT: You guys stand there for a second (groans)
his arm begins to push on yours, begins to bend

1100
01:12:20,816 --> 01:12:26,663
back a little bit, you reflex with might and
begin to set him back up to the center. You've

1101
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:31,533
reached a standstill, once again, back at the
center. His expression on his face looks

1102
01:12:31,533 --> 01:12:33,819
frustrated and surprised.

1103
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:36,646
SAM: You weren't expecting this, were you? (pants)
Neither was I!

1104
01:12:36,646 --> 01:12:39,794
MATT: Make another strength check.

1105
01:12:39,794 --> 01:12:45,376
SAM: Not as good. 11.

1106
01:12:45,376 --> 01:12:52,433
MATT: 11. At this point, as you say that, he
tenses and forces down your hand now, right at

1107
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:55,737
three-quarters to the table. Make another strength
check.

1108
01:12:55,737 --> 01:12:57,749
MARISHA: Come on, Scanlan!

1109
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:58,756
SAM: 16!

1110
01:12:58,756 --> 01:13:02,289
MATT: 16. (groans) About to touch the knuckles--

1111
01:13:02,289 --> 01:13:08,726
SAM: What is going on? I had-- This has
never happened before.

1112
01:13:08,854 --> 01:13:13,038
MATT: He's keeping his hand to his side, trying
not to grasp the edge of the table, which is

1113
01:13:13,038 --> 01:13:17,148
technically against the rules. He's looking around
at everyone watching and realizes the sheer amount

1114
01:13:17,148 --> 01:13:20,808
of attention that's put on the fact that this tiny
little gnome is now keeping him at a standstill.

1115
01:13:20,808 --> 01:13:28,792
LIAM: I shout out from the crowd, Scanlan! Pike is
here! She's astral-projected in!

1116
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:30,391
SAM: Natural one.

1117
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:35,505
(laughter)

1118
01:13:35,505 --> 01:13:45,806
MATT: With that moment of distraction, you look
around and (wham) your arm hits the table. Cheers

1119
01:13:45,806 --> 01:13:48,744
go on, everyone shouts happily.

1120
01:13:48,744 --> 01:13:51,037
SAM: You idiot!

1121
01:13:51,037 --> 01:13:53,552
LIAM: All the blood rushed somewhere else, that's
not my fault.

1122
01:13:53,552 --> 01:13:57,027
SAM: I had him! (groans)

1123
01:13:57,027 --> 01:14:03,208
MATT: He lifts up his tankard to the side, someone
begins pouring ale into it. He shouts his victory

1124
01:14:03,247 --> 01:14:07,566
out, everyone cheers. The barmaid pats you on your
back. "You did good, you did good."

1125
01:14:07,566 --> 01:14:13,041
SAM: I don't need your pity! Grog, kick this
motherfucker's ass!

1126
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:24,532
MATT: Two more events go by, two more gentlemen
have a showdown-- actually no, it's a woman and a

1127
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:28,471
man. The woman is a pretty tough-looking warrior,
probably one of the guards of Castle Whitestone.

1128
01:14:28,471 --> 01:14:34,001
She's still in partial armor, has been guarding
the event, has taken her helmet off to be part of

1129
01:14:34,001 --> 01:14:41,272
this event, taking a moment to relax. She goes up
against another merchant of the town and just

1130
01:14:41,272 --> 01:14:49,397
destroys him. The next bout is a man who, the way
he's dressed, appears to be a blacksmith. He still

1131
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:53,382
has his leather gauntlets on, he takes them off at
the table, takes off his leather apron and sets it

1132
01:14:53,382 --> 01:14:58,245
to the side. Gets down and ready and looks around
for his opponent and the two guards bring up the

1133
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:04,853
chained Vedmeyer, who then sits down at the table,
the chains hitting against the sides of the wooden

1134
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:09,963
table top and coasting to the ground as they
adjust. He puts his arm on the table with a thud,

1135
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:14,272
and has to bend over to even reach the other guy's
grasp. You can see the look on his face

1136
01:15:14,272 --> 01:15:24,551
immediately pale as he realizes who he's up
against. It's two rounds and maybe 20 seconds tops

1137
01:15:24,551 --> 01:15:30,629
before Vedmeyer slams him so hard you can part of
the tabletop splinters inward and the guy brings

1138
01:15:30,629 --> 01:15:38,567
his hand back with bleeding knuckles. He reaches
over, puts his hand out expectantly. The barmaid

1139
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:43,917
hands him a tankard full of ale. He downs it in
one gulp, slams it on on the table and stands back

1140
01:15:43,917 --> 01:15:53,837
up again. He glances over at you and steps back
into the crowd. The second round of the events go

1141
01:15:53,837 --> 01:15:58,190
in. You are paired up with the gentleman who
defeated Scanlan.

1142
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,809
MARISHA: Kick his ass, Grog!

1143
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:00,670
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1144
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,131
SAM: Put him in a body bag!

1145
01:16:02,131 --> 01:16:08,764
TRAVIS: I sit down and I say, I feel really bad
for you mate. You know, my friend? He's got hand

1146
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:15,406
herpes... So do I.

1147
01:16:15,406 --> 01:16:17,000
SAM: It's true.

1148
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:25,980
MATT: Make a deception roll.

1149
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,532
TRAVIS: 20! 19 plus one!

1150
01:16:28,532 --> 01:16:33,776
MATT: Natural one on his part. He looks genuinely
frightened and is about to back up and get the

1151
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:37,629
attention of the barmaid who's running this event
and he sees the crowd around.

1152
01:16:37,629 --> 01:16:40,034
TRAVIS: I mean, you're a farmer, right? You handle
food.

1153
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:49,878
MATT: He spits in his hand, puts it out and grabs
your hand. The barmaid once again. "And-- prove

1154
01:16:49,878 --> 01:16:53,533
"your strength!" Roll a strength check. He has
disadvantage.

1155
01:16:53,533 --> 01:16:56,970
TRAVIS: 21.

1156
01:16:56,970 --> 01:17:03,997
MATT: Natural one. He's already straining and the
back of his knuckles are immediately up against

1157
01:17:03,997 --> 01:17:08,073
the wood. You can see fear in his eyes and he's
gripping, but he's also trying to move his fingers

1158
01:17:08,073 --> 01:17:10,081
to make sure he doesn't make too much contact with
your hand.

1159
01:17:10,081 --> 01:17:12,077
Go ahead and roll another strength check.

1160
01:17:12,077 --> 01:17:16,513
TRAVIS: 11.

1161
01:17:16,513 --> 01:17:21,754
MATT: At which point, he sees the grin on your
face and gets his will back behind him and

1162
01:17:21,754 --> 01:17:25,655
(grunts) forces you back to the center. Make
another strength check.

1163
01:17:25,706 --> 01:17:27,810
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Seven.

1164
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,056
MATT: Natural 20.

1165
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:30,343
LAURA: Oh no!

1166
01:17:30,343 --> 01:17:34,087
MATT: He (groans) slams you right over on the edge
of the table. Make another check.

1167
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:35,916
MARISHA: Come on, Grog!

1168
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:40,575
TRAVIS: 23.

1169
01:17:40,575 --> 01:17:45,851
MATT: 19. Back up to the center, at a standstill.
You see now the veins bulging at his neck, you can

1170
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:51,150
see now, his face is turning red from the strain.
He's breathing heavily (pants) as he pushes again.

1171
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:52,312
Make another strength check.

1172
01:17:52,312 --> 01:17:53,704
LAURA: Come on, Grog!

1173
01:17:53,704 --> 01:17:55,365
TRAVIS: Eight.

1174
01:17:55,365 --> 01:18:01,647
MATT: (chuckles) Eight. (groans) Keeping you right
in the middle. Make another check.

1175
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:06,932
SAM: I hold up my hand and I use Minor Illusion to
make it all dotted with herpes.

1176
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:13,624
MATT: He glances sidelong at your hand and
(whimpers). I'm going to give him disadvantage on

1177
01:18:13,624 --> 01:18:16,156
this one. All right, what did you get?

1178
01:18:16,156 --> 01:18:17,544
TRAVIS: 17.

1179
01:18:17,544 --> 01:18:22,984
MATT: 17. (laughs) With a disadvantage, he got a
six. (groans) The hand goes at three-quarters.

1180
01:18:22,984 --> 01:18:26,275
He's now looking at you, looking at Scanlan's
hand, looking at you, looking at his own hand,

1181
01:18:26,275 --> 01:18:28,387
he's really worried. Make another strength check.

1182
01:18:28,387 --> 01:18:32,544
TRAVIS: It's slippery when the pores start to
seep. That's a one.

1183
01:18:32,544 --> 01:18:33,448
SAM: No!

1184
01:18:33,448 --> 01:18:34,567
TALIESIN: No!

1185
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:41,802
MATT: With a disadvantage, he gets a two. You guys
are at the middle again.

1186
01:18:41,802 --> 01:18:43,604
LAURA: Oh my god.

1187
01:18:43,604 --> 01:18:44,804
MATT: Big struggle.

1188
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:45,889
TRAVIS: 22.

1189
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:51,544
MATT: With disadvantage again, because of that--
though disadvantage is fading at this point. He

1190
01:18:51,544 --> 01:18:54,494
got a 12. So yeah (groans), now he's back down.

1191
01:18:54,494 --> 01:18:56,450
LAURA: Come on Grog, finish it!

1192
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:58,200
TRAVIS: 22.

1193
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:04,055
MATT: He got a seven. He looks at you, looks at
the hand, looks at you again and you can see in

1194
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:13,716
his face, the sudden look of acceptance as you
stop playing with him and (whack) slam it really

1195
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:18,160
hard on the wood. You can see, he pulls away...
(gasps) "Wash it! Wash it, please! Wash it,

1196
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,270
"somebody wash it!"

1197
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:24,033
TRAVIS: You know, the cure for that is actually on
my man Vax's groin. It's very magical.

1198
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:29,183
MATT: He slowly backs into the crowd, looking very
disturbed and disgusted as everyone else is

1199
01:19:29,183 --> 01:19:33,364
cheering for you. A tankard is slammed before you,
filled with ale.

1200
01:19:33,364 --> 01:19:36,013
"Drink up, you've earned it, champion."

1201
01:19:36,013 --> 01:19:42,221
TRAVIS: I look at Gonad over at the side. I drink
it, chug it down, and hold up the finger at the

1202
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:43,389
same time.

1203
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:50,618
MATT: (laughs) He sits there and tenses for a second with a
grin, as he growls, his cold breath in the cold

1204
01:19:50,662 --> 01:19:57,156
Winter's Crest air dissipates up above him and he
gives you a nod, the slow look of warrior

1205
01:19:57,156 --> 01:20:02,006
intensity, but respect. You can see he's looking
forward to hopefully this as much as you are, but

1206
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,102
he still has a battle to do himself.

1207
01:20:04,102 --> 01:20:08,745
LIAM: I've spent the last ten minutes while he's
kicking that guy's ass to find a soldier or

1208
01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:10,542
somebody in the crowd to bet.

1209
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:11,728
SAM: A young boy?

1210
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:13,840
LIAM: I'm not you.

1211
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,921
(laughter)

1212
01:20:15,921 --> 01:20:19,631
LIAM: 200 gold on Grog. Somebody in the crowd.

1213
01:20:19,631 --> 01:20:21,324
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1214
01:20:21,324 --> 01:20:22,899
TALIESIN: All right.

1215
01:20:22,899 --> 01:20:27,017
LIAM: 14.

1216
01:20:27,017 --> 01:20:33,417
MATT: Going around, you're hard-pressed to find
somebody who at this moment in time is interested

1217
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:38,768
in betting any money against the goliath that
helped save the city. You find one gentleman who

1218
01:20:38,768 --> 01:20:45,928
seems a little interested and he gives you this
sidelong, sleazy grin. "Tell you what, not 200

1219
01:20:45,928 --> 01:20:47,855
"gold, but I'll put 50 down."

1220
01:20:47,855 --> 01:20:50,968
LIAM: That's not worth it. 75 gold?

1221
01:20:50,968 --> 01:20:53,853
MATT: "Step away, halfie."

1222
01:20:53,895 --> 01:20:58,561
LAURA: Oh! I heard it. I give him the evil eye.

1223
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:07,622
MATT: He's too focused on the current bout at
hand. At this table, you can now see Vedmeyer and

1224
01:21:07,622 --> 01:21:14,228
the woman guard sits down. Someone's like, "Oh,
Trisha's wrestling."

1225
01:21:14,228 --> 01:21:19,669
TRAVIS: Her name's Trisha? Trish the Dish.

1226
01:21:19,669 --> 01:21:27,130
MATT: Vedmeyer, again with his chains against the
wood as he sits down with a smile. He gives her a

1227
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:31,521
grin and nod. She's just-- intensity towards him
the whole time. You can see there's a little bit

1228
01:21:31,521 --> 01:21:36,586
of intensity to win, but you also see spite in
that look. You see that she knows what he's done

1229
01:21:36,586 --> 01:21:44,914
and this victory means more to her than otherwise.
The two of them-- first match, she pushes and gets

1230
01:21:44,914 --> 01:21:50,656
the upper hand. A three-quarter view perspective,
she's tensing herself, you hear the muscle tensing

1231
01:21:50,707 --> 01:21:57,810
beneath the armor itself, the metal creaking as
her whole upper torso begins to push into it. She

1232
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:59,104
begins to push it back--

1233
01:21:59,104 --> 01:22:00,521
LAURA: Yeah! Trish the Dish!

1234
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:03,532
ALL: Trish the Dish! Trish the Dish!

1235
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:08,739
MATT: As you guys are shouting this and keeping it
going, she gets pushed back again into a defensive

1236
01:22:08,739 --> 01:22:13,312
position. You see the blood rushing to her face,
but he himself is starting to look really intense.

1237
01:22:13,312 --> 01:22:20,434
You can see there's surprise in his face from the
battle she's giving. She (groans) pushes him back

1238
01:22:20,434 --> 01:22:23,192
to the center, this back and forth, the crowd is
starting to get really intense. You can see the

1239
01:22:23,192 --> 01:22:27,097
shouting, the cheering, gets really quiet as
everyone is now breathlessly watching this bout.

1240
01:22:27,097 --> 01:22:40,930
She pushes to three-quarters-- He rallies his own
strength, but it's not enough, as she (impact

1241
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:53,733
sound) onto the table. As she releases, she goes,
"You deserve that, and much more." She gets up and

1242
01:22:53,733 --> 01:22:58,871
walks away. The tankard is held out for her. She
pushes it aside and cracks her knuckles as she

1243
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:07,356
steps away. Vedmeyer is there staring at his hand.
"Hmm. Fitting. It's a real pity, I was looking

1244
01:23:07,356 --> 01:23:08,910
"forward to fighting you."

1245
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:11,292
TRAVIS: Well, get used to disappointment,
shithead.

1246
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:15,826
MATT: At which point, his chains are tightened and
the guards lift him up again off of his seat and

1247
01:23:15,826 --> 01:23:18,729
he gets led off back into the crowd.

1248
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:21,621
LAURA: Yeah, walk away, you beardless bastard.

1249
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:27,097
MATT: As everyone gathers in now, you can now see
more discussions and people are starting to really

1250
01:23:27,097 --> 01:23:35,515
place bets down now on the outcome of this
circumstance. The barmaid comes up again. "You,

1251
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:44,083
"champion Grog, sit down. And you, champion Trisha,
sit down. As the final round of this show of

1252
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:48,267
"majestic might happens now. Hands clasped,
please."

1253
01:23:48,267 --> 01:23:52,758
TRAVIS: If I may, thank you for your service to
this city. That last round

1254
01:23:52,758 --> 01:23:54,854
was a true pleasure to watch.

1255
01:23:54,854 --> 01:23:59,388
MATT: Her face goes from hardened to soft for a
minute as she reaches out and clasps you, not hand

1256
01:23:59,388 --> 01:24:06,006
in hand, but forearm to forearm, and gives you a
solid shake. "I've done so little. You've done far

1257
01:24:06,006 --> 01:24:09,474
"more. But we all must do our part to keep the city
safe."

1258
01:24:09,474 --> 01:24:11,388
TRAVIS: Aye.

1259
01:24:11,388 --> 01:24:14,225
MATT: "But right now, I'm going to have to destroy
you."

1260
01:24:14,225 --> 01:24:17,457
LAURA: I kind of love Trish the Dish.

1261
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:19,065
MARISHA: I know, I like her, too.

1262
01:24:19,065 --> 01:24:26,343
MATT: Her clasp on your forearm slides back,
keeping your hand. Both of you tense muscles,

1263
01:24:26,343 --> 01:24:28,467
we're talking Predator vs. Schwarzenegger.

1264
01:24:28,467 --> 01:24:33,386
TRAVIS: (Schwarzenegger accent) Yah, what's the
matter, Dylan? You guys ate too many pretzels?

1265
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:43,564
MATT: (laughs) Just like that. As the crowd begins
to shout different names, you can see people

1266
01:24:43,564 --> 01:24:48,997
going, "Trish, Trish, Trish, Grog, Grog, Grog."
The voices are starting to grow and grow as both

1267
01:24:48,997 --> 01:24:56,375
of you are standing there focusing on each other.
You can see her tightly bunned dark brunette hair,

1268
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:59,912
you can see these green eyes piercing through,
looking straight into yours with a bit of sly

1269
01:24:59,912 --> 01:25:02,904
smirk on the side of her face. You can see a
little bit of a scar on the outside of her face

1270
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:06,714
that's longtime healed and you can see she's
definitely seen her share of battle, just from the

1271
01:25:06,714 --> 01:25:08,929
complexion and the intensity in her face.

1272
01:25:08,929 --> 01:25:11,920
MARISHA: She's one of us.

1273
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:17,119
MATT: "For the final round, let this show of might
begin!" Strength check.

1274
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:19,612
TRAVIS: Eight.

1275
01:25:19,612 --> 01:25:26,323
MATT: As the moment of tension hits, you can sense
there's definitely a balance, both of you are

1276
01:25:26,323 --> 01:25:33,794
keeping at bay. She cocks her head curiously and
forces you down to the three-quarter back

1277
01:25:33,794 --> 01:25:36,124
position. Go ahead and make another strength
check.

1278
01:25:36,124 --> 01:25:38,762
LAURA: Come on, Grog! Oh my god.

1279
01:25:38,762 --> 01:25:39,859
TRAVIS: Six.

1280
01:25:39,859 --> 01:25:43,374
LIAM: It's that sword's influence.

1281
01:25:43,374 --> 01:25:46,686
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's laughing in the Bag of
Holding.

1282
01:25:46,686 --> 01:25:51,684
MATT: She brings you right down to the edge of the
table and you can see in her face, there's this

1283
01:25:51,684 --> 01:25:59,007
genuine look of surprise, like she probably could
have finished you, but she feels like there's a

1284
01:25:59,007 --> 01:26:01,662
trick or there's something to it that she can't be
beating you this easy.

1285
01:26:01,662 --> 01:26:07,420
TRAVIS: I'm so surprised by what's happening. I
use Intimidating Presence on her.

1286
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:09,395
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1287
01:26:09,395 --> 01:26:14,977
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Go ahead and make an
intimidation check.

1288
01:26:14,977 --> 01:26:18,559
TRAVIS: Fuck.

1289
01:26:18,559 --> 01:26:20,876
MATT: Does this have to be during a rage?

1290
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:23,131
TRAVIS: 12. I'll go into a rage for it.

1291
01:26:23,131 --> 01:26:27,134
MATT: (laughing) It may have to be. Let's see.

1292
01:26:27,134 --> 01:26:29,919
LAURA: (laughing) Why weren't you raging the whole
time?

1293
01:26:29,919 --> 01:26:33,468
TRAVIS: I was hoping I wouldn't need it!

1294
01:26:33,468 --> 01:26:36,544
MATT: No, you don't have to be in a rage for it,
but you can choose to, if you want.

1295
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,851
TRAVIS: it doesn't add anything to my strength
roll, right?

1296
01:26:38,851 --> 01:26:44,553
MATT: A 12 for intimidation? Well, what do you want
to do to try and intimidate her? She's about to

1297
01:26:44,602 --> 01:26:46,371
finish you off on this table.

1298
01:26:46,371 --> 01:26:53,622
TRAVIS: I'm like, oh! (grunts) and I bite down on
my tongue and blood just starts to pour out of the

1299
01:26:53,622 --> 01:26:54,642
corner of my mouth.

1300
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:55,899
LAURA: Oh, gross!

1301
01:26:55,899 --> 01:27:00,857
MATT: She sees this, and her eyes go wide for a
second. She pulls back and for a brief moment, you

1302
01:27:00,857 --> 01:27:05,446
feel her grip loosen ever so slightly. Go ahead
and make the next strength check with advantage.

1303
01:27:05,446 --> 01:27:13,208
TRAVIS: Fuck. (laughing) It's unreal. 11.

1304
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,304
MATT: 11?

1305
01:27:14,304 --> 01:27:16,070
TRAVIS: The other one was a one.

1306
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:20,223
MATT: Well, I'm glad you had advantage on that;
she rolled a five. So you do manage to (groans)

1307
01:27:20,223 --> 01:27:24,512
force her back up. You're still in a bad place,
but you manage to pull out of that circle and you

1308
01:27:24,512 --> 01:27:29,798
can see now her intensity hits and she realizes
she's not going to go soft on you at all going

1309
01:27:29,798 --> 01:27:35,250
forward. But as the blood pools down your chin,
you can feel the iron-y taste swishing around in

1310
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:40,004
your mouth and you can see there's a little bit of
a quiver to her. She's still spooked by this whole

1311
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:43,598
circumstance, but she's trying her best. Go ahead
and make another strength check.

1312
01:27:43,598 --> 01:27:45,713
TRAVIS: She's battle-worn. 19.

1313
01:27:45,713 --> 01:27:46,738
LAURA: That's good!

1314
01:27:46,738 --> 01:27:51,035
MATT: That's good. She has disadvantage on these
because of the fright. I'm giving her that, but

1315
01:27:51,035 --> 01:27:54,199
even still, she still rolls a 17. What did you
roll, total?

1316
01:27:54,199 --> 01:27:55,180
TRAVIS: 19.

1317
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:59,123
MATT: 19. You guys keep it-- she's still holding
you there, you're not able to gain any ground.

1318
01:27:59,123 --> 01:28:03,086
You're really impressed by this display she's
giving you. Roll again.

1319
01:28:03,086 --> 01:28:05,506
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage? No.

1320
01:28:05,506 --> 01:28:06,363
MATT: No.

1321
01:28:06,363 --> 01:28:07,656
TRAVIS: 12.

1322
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:11,709
MATT: 12? Okay. She forces you back down--

1323
01:28:11,709 --> 01:28:16,457
SAM: I step forward and I sing a song of
inspiration.

1324
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,171
MATT: What are you singing?

1325
01:28:18,171 --> 01:28:24,118
SAM: I sing, (sings) let's go raging now,
everybody's learning how, come on on a rampage

1326
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:25,002
with me!

1327
01:28:25,002 --> 01:28:27,014
TALIESIN: Come on on a rampage with me!

1328
01:28:27,014 --> 01:28:32,885
MATT: All right, take a d10 inspiration, as you
hear the song break through the intensity and you

1329
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:37,673
know that Scanlan's presence alone in itself and
his fine ditties means that you can do this.

1330
01:28:37,673 --> 01:28:39,165
TRAVIS: Fine ditties!

1331
01:28:39,165 --> 01:28:41,908
LIAM: Show us your ditties!

1332
01:28:41,908 --> 01:28:44,402
TRAVIS: 16.

1333
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:46,196
MATT: 16?

1334
01:28:46,196 --> 01:28:48,420
LAURA: With the ten inspiration.

1335
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:55,508
MATT: With the ten? Okay. It's good you did that.
You force her back up, she starts like, really

1336
01:28:55,542 --> 01:29:00,731
pushing into it and you can see now the sweat's
dripping off of her brow, her eyes are quivering.

1337
01:29:00,731 --> 01:29:04,430
Make another check. How long does that last?

1338
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:05,798
TRAVIS: Seven.

1339
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:08,953
MATT: Seven. Hold on.

1340
01:29:08,953 --> 01:29:10,267
LAURA: You should switch.

1341
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:11,491
SAM: Grog, what are you doing?!

1342
01:29:11,491 --> 01:29:16,228
TRAVIS: (laughing) I don't know! They're so low!
It was all those free rolls during the two weeks

1343
01:29:16,228 --> 01:29:17,608
when I rolled 20--

1344
01:29:17,608 --> 01:29:19,713
SAM: Oh my god, do you really have hand herpes?

1345
01:29:19,713 --> 01:29:21,511
(laughter)

1346
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:29,473
MATT: What did you roll?

1347
01:29:29,473 --> 01:29:30,809
TRAVIS: Seven.

1348
01:29:30,809 --> 01:29:35,533
MATT: Seven. Yeah, she still beats you. So, at
this point, you're pushed down.

1349
01:29:35,533 --> 01:29:37,476
She gives you this look--

1350
01:29:37,476 --> 01:29:38,794
TRAVIS: This is unreal.

1351
01:29:38,794 --> 01:29:48,350
MATT: Yeah. Of intense anger-- and her face
softens and she gives you a nod of respect. (thud)

1352
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:59,260
Releases her grip and pulls away, holds her arms
up, crowd goes wild. The drink is slammed in front

1353
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:03,732
of her, the ale swishing and spilling over the
side. She takes it in one hand and slides it

1354
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:04,973
forward and hands it to you.

1355
01:30:04,973 --> 01:30:06,659
LAURA: Aw, she's a good lady.

1356
01:30:06,659 --> 01:30:13,286
TRAVIS: You are a true warrior and I hope you'll
continue to protect this city with that strength.

1357
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:21,595
MATT: "I intend to." She gives you a nod, walks
around, accepts her coin purse and steps back into

1358
01:30:21,595 --> 01:30:22,889
the rest of the celebration.

1359
01:30:22,889 --> 01:30:32,107
TRAVIS: I walk away (coughs), coughing (coughs),
trying not to cry. (coughs) I take my tankard and

1360
01:30:32,107 --> 01:30:38,081
splash it on my face. Oh, it's just ale. It's just
ale. (sobs)

1361
01:30:38,081 --> 01:30:41,428
SAM: It's okay, Grog. Let's go get you drunk.

1362
01:30:41,428 --> 01:30:53,751
MATT: As this is happening, a courier comes up
dressed in colors that are reminiscent of the

1363
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:59,999
courier service that travels through Emon, through
Westruun. There's a certain type of overcoat they

1364
01:30:59,999 --> 01:31:05,285
wear that gives you the inclination that they've
traveled from nearby civilization. Steps up with a

1365
01:31:05,285 --> 01:31:09,234
rolled up sequence of letters and a small box that
is wrapped up.

1366
01:31:09,234 --> 01:31:12,060
MARISHA: Oh look, the young boy you ordered,
Scanlan.

1367
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:15,827
MATT: He's in his mid-20s.

1368
01:31:15,827 --> 01:31:18,461
(laughter)

1369
01:31:18,461 --> 01:31:25,710
MATT: He's asking around. "Looking for a Percival
and a Vox Machina. Percival?"

1370
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:27,030
TALIESIN: I'm Percival.

1371
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,366
MATT: "You're Percival?"

1372
01:31:28,366 --> 01:31:29,437
TALIESIN: Yes.

1373
01:31:29,437 --> 01:31:35,847
MATT: "I'm to deliver this to you." He hands you
the small box. "I have here two small letters."

1374
01:31:35,887 --> 01:31:44,327
And hands them over both to you. There's a small,
thin one that is actually written to Percival, and

1375
01:31:44,327 --> 01:31:48,317
there's one addressed to Vox Machina.

1376
01:31:48,317 --> 01:31:52,615
TALIESIN: I was going to sit here and watch you
roll them.

1377
01:31:52,615 --> 01:31:54,004
MARISHA: Presentation's lost.

1378
01:31:54,004 --> 01:31:55,251
MATT: That's fine.

1379
01:31:55,251 --> 01:31:57,518
SAM: I just noticed Taliesin's outfit, by the
way.

1380
01:31:57,518 --> 01:32:00,188
LAURA: We were supposed to wear pajamas.

1381
01:32:00,188 --> 01:32:04,740
TALIESIN: I wore my pajamas. My muppet pajamas.

1382
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,684
MATT: Yeah, the week got busy and we forgot.

1383
01:32:06,684 --> 01:32:09,929
TRAVIS: You don't want me in my pajamas because
they're--

1384
01:32:09,929 --> 01:32:12,487
MATT: That one's to you and the other one's to Vox
Machina.

1385
01:32:12,487 --> 01:32:18,170
SAM: (sings) Letters, we've got letters.

1386
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:24,739
TALIESIN: Oh, this is quite interesting. "Vox
Machina, a little bird tells me you have been

1387
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:31,281
"playing the heroes again. Keep this up, and the
whole world will end up indebted to you. Please

1388
01:32:31,281 --> 01:32:37,720
"accept this small gift in the spirit of Winter's
Crest, as a token of my enduring gratitude.

1389
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:44,019
"Perhaps it will prove useful in a difficult
moment. In the meantime, I look forward to a

1390
01:32:44,019 --> 01:32:51,382
"fuller account of your deeds reaching us in
Vasselheim. A joyous Crest to you all. It seems

1391
01:32:51,382 --> 01:32:53,746
"you have earned it. Lillith."

1392
01:32:53,746 --> 01:32:55,814
LAURA: Oh!

1393
01:32:55,814 --> 01:32:58,788
TALIESIN: "P.S., Zahra sends her greetings."

1394
01:32:58,788 --> 01:33:00,799
SAM: (dreamily) Zahra.

1395
01:33:00,799 --> 01:33:02,376
MARISHA: The tieflings!

1396
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:07,227
SAM: We had quite a night together. Just braiding
each other's hair.

1397
01:33:07,227 --> 01:33:10,381
TALIESIN: I tuck the private note away and put it
in my pocket.

1398
01:33:10,381 --> 01:33:13,549
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's another one, right?

1399
01:33:13,549 --> 01:33:15,390
MATT: There is a box, yes.

1400
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,724
LAURA: Oh, is it big enough to hold a giant
carpet?

1401
01:33:17,724 --> 01:33:21,723
TALIESIN: Perhaps a small ice egg.

1402
01:33:21,723 --> 01:33:23,578
MATT: It's about that big in your hands.

1403
01:33:23,578 --> 01:33:25,895
TALIESIN: We open the box.

1404
01:33:25,895 --> 01:33:28,045
MATT: You open the gift. Inside, there are two--

1405
01:33:28,045 --> 01:33:29,322
SAM: Check it for traps!

1406
01:33:29,322 --> 01:33:38,765
MATT: (laughs) Make a reflex save-- no. As you
open it, you see inside there are two crystalline

1407
01:33:38,765 --> 01:33:41,753
stones that both identically look like that.

1408
01:33:41,753 --> 01:33:43,106
LAURA: Okay.

1409
01:33:43,106 --> 01:33:45,062
TALIESIN: It's been a while since we had a visual
aid.

1410
01:33:45,106 --> 01:33:52,438
MATT: Yeah, it's nice when you have a really good
artist, apparently. But two stones like this. They

1411
01:33:52,438 --> 01:33:54,270
are called Gate Stones.

1412
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:56,191
SAM: Gate Stones?

1413
01:33:56,191 --> 01:34:04,313
MATT: The two stones are essentially linked. One
is placed wherever you like and the other is kept

1414
01:34:04,313 --> 01:34:08,830
with you. A single individual, just an individual,
not a group, can take a minute to concentrate on

1415
01:34:08,830 --> 01:34:13,057
one stone and be instantly transported to where
the other stone is, with the stone.

1416
01:34:13,057 --> 01:34:14,254
TRAVIS: Badass.

1417
01:34:14,254 --> 01:34:16,436
LIAM: One-way ticket.

1418
01:34:16,436 --> 01:34:17,650
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

1419
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:21,530
TRAVIS: You take it with you and you can zoom back
to wherever you left it.

1420
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:24,293
SAM: There are two stones in this box?

1421
01:34:24,293 --> 01:34:25,899
MATT: Yeah. They are the two that are linked.

1422
01:34:25,899 --> 01:34:27,186
TRAVIS: A person or linked?

1423
01:34:27,186 --> 01:34:28,831
MATT: No, there is a single set.

1424
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:33,288
MARISHA: So this is a get out of jail free card.

1425
01:34:33,288 --> 01:34:37,822
SAM: Or a bamf-in-Pike card.

1426
01:34:37,822 --> 01:34:44,361
MATT: There's multiple situational uses for it,
depending. But apparently this has been

1427
01:34:44,408 --> 01:34:50,034
painstakingly either enchanted, constructed, and
sent by Lillith for you.

1428
01:34:50,034 --> 01:34:51,902
LIAM: They're all from Lillith?

1429
01:34:51,902 --> 01:34:54,071
MATT: Yeah, the letters and those two stones.

1430
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:55,638
SAM: From Lillith and Zahra?

1431
01:34:55,638 --> 01:34:58,225
MATT: And Zahra, both of them, essentially.

1432
01:34:58,225 --> 01:35:00,448
MARISHA: Yeah, Lillith doesn't have the other
stone?

1433
01:35:00,448 --> 01:35:02,233
LIAM: For a little arcane booty call?

1434
01:35:02,233 --> 01:35:04,592
TALIESIN: I don't know <i>what</i> you're talking
about.

1435
01:35:04,592 --> 01:35:06,660
TRAVIS: Please?

1436
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:07,829
TALIESIN: No.

1437
01:35:07,829 --> 01:35:10,510
LAURA: I don't think I've ever seen Percy giggle
before.

1438
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:12,312
TRAVIS: Are you blushing?

1439
01:35:12,312 --> 01:35:15,007
TALIESIN: No. It's cold. Very cold.

1440
01:35:15,007 --> 01:35:20,024
TRAVIS: It's a new demon, isn't it? The blushing
demon!

1441
01:35:20,024 --> 01:35:21,479
TALIESIN: She was great, wasn't she?

1442
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:24,209
SAM: Lillith is a true friend. Zahra, as well.

1443
01:35:24,209 --> 01:35:25,821
TALIESIN: Zahra is great, as well.

1444
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:29,855
MATT: You hear murmurs now, people mentioning the
pie-eating contest starting soon.

1445
01:35:29,899 --> 01:35:31,087
SAM: Vex and Vax!

1446
01:35:31,087 --> 01:35:34,451
LAURA: All right, we'll give it a go.

1447
01:35:34,451 --> 01:35:38,637
MATT: As you guys make your way over there, we're
going to go ahead and go to our break. We're at

1448
01:35:38,677 --> 01:35:42,006
the middle point here, yeah. So it's going to be a
longer break guys, because we've got a little

1449
01:35:42,006 --> 01:35:47,344
present for you. I know for a while we've been
talking about this work we've been doing on a

1450
01:35:47,344 --> 01:35:52,398
pre-stream story of Vox Machina's adventures that
you guys hadn't had a chance to really

1451
01:35:52,398 --> 01:35:58,799
experience. So, through all of us doing our
individual narration, as well as the wonderful

1452
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:09,079
Wendy Sullivan doing incredible work on 50 pieces
of art for this, and using music from actually

1453
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:13,642
some of our Critters that sent us some great
musical tracks, we have been able to present to

1454
01:36:13,642 --> 01:36:19,376
you over the next 20 minutes, the story of Vox
Machina, the beginning. So, enjoy guys, we'll see

1455
01:36:19,376 --> 01:36:20,554
you here in a moment.

1456
01:36:20,554 --> 01:36:21,976
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1457
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:30,841
MATT: The grandest of adventures often stem from
humble beginnings. The story of Vox Machina is one

1458
01:36:30,841 --> 01:36:37,937
such a tale. They begin as a ragtag group of
mercenaries in the swamp town of Stillben, eking

1459
01:36:37,937 --> 01:36:43,866
out a living, when a job board posting brings them
to Fendril Vas, the wealthy head of a small

1460
01:36:43,866 --> 01:36:45,438
merchant empire.

1461
01:36:45,438 --> 01:36:51,443
Hired to investigate new competition in town
called The Myriad, the path eventually leads them

1462
01:36:51,563 --> 01:36:56,144
into a chamber housing a planar rift, pulling the
group into the plane of the stillborn god

1463
01:36:56,144 --> 01:37:03,628
Crysa-Thul. It is revealed that the contract was a
ruse to feed the party to the undead, fetal deity.

1464
01:37:03,628 --> 01:37:09,404
Upon destroying the abomination, the party returns
to repay Fendril's deceit

1465
01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:12,393
with a blade to the throat.

1466
01:37:12,393 --> 01:37:17,115
LAURA: Weeks pass, and Grog the barbarian hasn't
been seen since suddenly leaving for the city of

1467
01:37:17,115 --> 01:37:22,378
Westruun. Heading there in search of him, the
party meets his childhood friend, and their new

1468
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:28,875
companion: the gnome cleric, Pike. Grog apparently
hasn't been acting normally, and had marched off

1469
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:34,787
on his own through the Bramblewood towards the
ominous mountain, Gatshadow. The party followed,

1470
01:37:34,787 --> 01:37:40,868
dispensing with a troop of roadside thieves along
the way, and wound their way toward the mountain.

1471
01:37:40,868 --> 01:37:47,445
Deep within, they encountered an abandoned
subterranean city and eventually a crypt housing a

1472
01:37:47,489 --> 01:37:53,842
mind-controlled Grog, the reanimated corpse of his
father Strongjaw, and a dying mage attempting a

1473
01:37:53,842 --> 01:38:00,729
ritual to Lichdom. Our heroes slayed the mage, but
not before he could complete the ritual and embed

1474
01:38:00,729 --> 01:38:03,346
his phylactery into Grog's chest.

1475
01:38:03,346 --> 01:38:08,678
Returning to town in search of aid, they find
there are few of enough knowledge or power to

1476
01:38:08,678 --> 01:38:15,044
ascertain the nature of Grog's wound. Also, rumors
of missing children begin to reach the party's

1477
01:38:15,044 --> 01:38:21,923
ears. While contemplating all this at a local inn,
the party is approached by a mysterious elf named

1478
01:38:21,923 --> 01:38:27,860
Drez Vina who wishes to pay handsomely for the
party to infiltrate an archmage's tower, and

1479
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,810
retrieve a particular brass box within.

1480
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:36,152
Pushing forward in the hopes of speaking with this
archmage, the party accepts, and passes through

1481
01:38:36,152 --> 01:38:43,192
arcane trap after trap to reach the top of the
tower, deciding not to steal from the archmage but

1482
01:38:43,192 --> 01:38:50,073
instead parley with him for his aid. The tower's
keeper, Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien, agrees to help

1483
01:38:50,073 --> 01:38:56,189
and sends the party to collect two items he
requires for the ritual: the skull of a nightmare

1484
01:38:56,189 --> 01:39:03,441
and the heart of a nymph. The caveat: their
defeated foe is indeed a lich now, and in merely

1485
01:39:03,441 --> 01:39:07,279
two weeks, he will be reborn within Grog!

1486
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:13,426
They travel north to the Umbra Hills, wrestle with
a small cult to slay their infernal messenger and

1487
01:39:13,426 --> 01:39:20,789
his nightmare steed, and find a fresh companion in
Percy, newly freed from imprisonment. From there,

1488
01:39:20,789 --> 01:39:27,963
the party rushes south to the Frostweald, a forest
shrouded in eternal winter. Battling past

1489
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:34,683
basilisks, the party finds a single, unfrozen pool
where they coax a nymph from her dimensional

1490
01:39:34,683 --> 01:39:41,761
sanctuary. Talking their way out of battle, Grog
enters the sanctuary with the nymph, and returns

1491
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:47,579
holding a jewel gifted by the beautiful creature:
the "heart" of the nymph.

1492
01:39:47,579 --> 01:39:53,095
LIAM: Traveling back to the archmage, the ritual
is completed and the phylactery destroyed in time,

1493
01:39:53,095 --> 01:40:00,715
but not without some lingering necromancy branded
within Grog. They are suddenly approached by the

1494
01:40:00,715 --> 01:40:07,630
mysterious elf again, saying his master is unhappy
with the broken contract, and he demands that either

1495
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:13,852
the debt be paid, or the party complete a more
difficult contract in its place. The party

1496
01:40:13,852 --> 01:40:19,402
accepts, and heads into the Shade Barrow, an
ancient druid burial chamber that was purchased

1497
01:40:19,402 --> 01:40:25,345
and renovated by an eccentric lord who made it his
own tomb. Fighting the denizens of the barrow,

1498
01:40:25,345 --> 01:40:31,998
they locate the tomb and the iron golem guarding
it. Successfully defeating the golem, they tear

1499
01:40:31,998 --> 01:40:38,138
the Arcane Cortex from its chest and return it to
Drez to square their debt.

1500
01:40:38,138 --> 01:40:44,299
After a bit of R and R, a clean-shaven dwarf named
Grimthorne propositions the group to enter a

1501
01:40:44,299 --> 01:40:51,212
nearby, underground fighting ring, even offering
to represent them. The party agrees and,

1502
01:40:51,247 --> 01:40:54,766
not surprisingly, manages to pull off a victory.

1503
01:40:54,766 --> 01:41:00,360
With the holiday of Winter's Crest arriving, the
town bustles with preparation for a festival,

1504
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:07,775
during which a strange blue crystal is delivered
in the name of Archmage Eskil. This crystal

1505
01:41:07,775 --> 01:41:14,213
suddenly detonates, freezing the entire populace
of Westruun in ice-- though the party is protected

1506
01:41:14,213 --> 01:41:21,970
by a sudden ally in the streets. In a last-ditch
arcane effort, a mystic merchant named Noja

1507
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:29,085
manages to shield the group from harm. And where
the crystal previously rested now stood a pale,

1508
01:41:29,085 --> 01:41:36,865
nude woman of white hair and frail physique. She
opens a portal and leaps through, the party giving

1509
01:41:36,865 --> 01:41:43,935
chase into what seems like an icy, frozen world,
chaotic and elemental in nature. They catch up to

1510
01:41:43,935 --> 01:41:52,697
the woman, who then reveals her true self: a great
white dragon. Weakened by her premature "rebirth",

1511
01:41:52,697 --> 01:41:58,134
the party manages to defeat her, and upon
returning to Westruun, discover its people

1512
01:41:58,134 --> 01:42:00,790
released from their icy prison.

1513
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:07,658
With the archmage Eskil Ryndarien now on trial for
the attack on Westruun, the party intercedes and

1514
01:42:07,658 --> 01:42:13,814
proves his innocence. In thanks, Eskil uses his
talents to investigate the source of the blue

1515
01:42:13,814 --> 01:42:21,375
crystal, revealing the powerful society of thieves,
known as the Clasp, responsible for its delivery.

1516
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:28,155
Vax, having previously been a member of the Clasp,
knows the main headquarters lies within the

1517
01:42:28,155 --> 01:42:32,938
capital city of Emon, and Vox Machina sets out for
the west.

1518
01:42:32,938 --> 01:42:38,430
ASHLEY: Upon arriving in the sprawling metropolis
of Emon, the party continues to hear of children

1519
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:44,115
disappearing, and reports of a black-haired,
golden-eyed boy befriending them before they

1520
01:42:44,115 --> 01:42:50,891
vanish. While investigating, they do a few odd
jobs, one of which unexpectedly leads them to the

1521
01:42:50,891 --> 01:42:59,998
home of Syldor, Vex and Vax's father, and his new
wife and child. Awkwardness aside, Syldor is here

1522
01:43:00,046 --> 01:43:05,912
as ambassador to Syngorn, the elven city of their
origin, to seek aid from the Sovereign Uriel

1523
01:43:05,912 --> 01:43:07,323
Tal'Dorei.

1524
01:43:07,323 --> 01:43:12,980
However, the political climate of Emon is tense
with a recent, failed attempt on the royal

1525
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:19,837
family's life making Uriel unreachable at the
moment. Syldor's connection within the Council has

1526
01:43:19,837 --> 01:43:25,750
now gone missing, and his mission stands at a
complete standstill. He hires the party to look in

1527
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:32,337
on this missing ally, Sir Gregory Fince, and get
his ear back to Syngornian business.

1528
01:43:32,371 --> 01:43:38,976
Vox Machina finds Sir Gregory's home dark and
still, pushing them to infiltrate and investigate.

1529
01:43:38,976 --> 01:43:44,926
Within, they discover a dark presence in the home,
leading them into a battle with demons in the

1530
01:43:44,926 --> 01:43:52,361
basement. The battle won, Sir Gregory's tortured
corpse is found, as are his notes about the

1531
01:43:52,361 --> 01:43:58,840
attempted assassination on Uriel and his family.
It seems that since the attempt, the royal family

1532
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:05,309
has grown strange and withdrawn, keeping Uriel
from the council most hours, and his wife now

1533
01:44:05,309 --> 01:44:11,178
demanding she attend all meetings, whispering in
the Sovereign's ear and scoffing at the others who

1534
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:12,705
defy their decree.

1535
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:20,491
A General Krieg thwarted the attempt, and is
mentioned often. The party decides to inquire with

1536
01:44:20,491 --> 01:44:26,795
him. On their way out of the basement, half of the
party falls into a trap, tumbling into a cistern

1537
01:44:26,795 --> 01:44:32,956
and are flushed deep below into a subterranean
river system. The trapped party members-- Vex,

1538
01:44:32,991 --> 01:44:40,701
Keyleth, Grog, Tiberius, and Percy-- come to rest
on a small island in the vast Crystalfen Lake,

1539
01:44:40,756 --> 01:44:43,334
home to a terrible aboleth!

1540
01:44:43,334 --> 01:44:50,112
Barely escaping, they eventually discover the base
remnants of an ancient town, long toppled, and a

1541
01:44:50,112 --> 01:44:57,570
small hut that contains a clever hag named Trysta.
Tiberius finds one of his prized artifacts and

1542
01:44:57,570 --> 01:45:05,045
makes a dangerous deal to acquire it. The party
barters for information on how to escape, which

1543
01:45:05,045 --> 01:45:10,837
Trysta will give... in exchange for their aid in
slaying a newly nested denizen that threatens her

1544
01:45:10,837 --> 01:45:18,522
work. The party agrees, climbing to the very top
of the Crystalfen Cavern to do battle with an

1545
01:45:18,522 --> 01:45:24,231
umber-hulk. The fight goes south when Grog is
tossed from the cavern ceiling, nearly dying upon

1546
01:45:24,231 --> 01:45:32,587
impact with the island, but victory is eventually
theirs. Returning, Trysta shows them a hidden

1547
01:45:32,587 --> 01:45:36,957
staircase that exits into the Graveyard District
of Emon.

1548
01:45:36,957 --> 01:45:42,413
TRAVIS: The other members-- Vax, Pike, and
Scanlan-- set out to find where the cistern could

1549
01:45:42,413 --> 01:45:49,694
have drained to. Scanlan leaves to seek out a map
of the sewers, while Vax and Pike notice they are

1550
01:45:49,694 --> 01:45:55,753
being followed through the town. Leading the
pursuers into an alley, the shadowed figures

1551
01:45:55,753 --> 01:46:02,895
attack, eventually knocking them both out. Vax and
Pike awaken within the Clasp's headquarters,

1552
01:46:02,895 --> 01:46:09,906
meeting with one of their leaders, or Spirelings,
named Modeth. The Clasp had Sir Gregory's home

1553
01:46:09,906 --> 01:46:17,245
under surveillance, as bad political stuff can be
difficult for the way the Clasp does business, and

1554
01:46:17,245 --> 01:46:22,339
when our heroes were spotted leaving, they had to
be interrogated.

1555
01:46:22,339 --> 01:46:29,083
Vax reveals his membership to the Clasp sect in
Westruun, and Modeth calls for a test of their

1556
01:46:29,083 --> 01:46:37,190
skills and intent. Pike and Vax are then forced to
do battle with a chained chimera in the Clasp's

1557
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:44,843
arena. Their might rings true, and the beast falls
beneath their weapons, but Modeth is not

1558
01:46:44,843 --> 01:46:45,973
convinced.

1559
01:46:45,973 --> 01:46:52,425
While the two are held overnight, they manage to
escape from the Clasp's lair, exiting into the

1560
01:46:52,538 --> 01:46:59,541
night and managing to locate the rest of the party
in the Graveyard district. Knowing their next step

1561
01:46:59,541 --> 01:47:06,105
is to speak with General Krieg, Vax forges a
letter of summons using Sir Gregory's handwriting,

1562
01:47:06,105 --> 01:47:13,304
and the party is allowed entry into the carefully
guarded Cloudtop District, the innermost area of

1563
01:47:13,304 --> 01:47:18,249
the city and home to the Citrine Garrison, as well
as Emon's Palace.

1564
01:47:18,249 --> 01:47:24,204
Approaching the garrison, they have an audience
with General Krieg, who seems nice and keenly

1565
01:47:24,204 --> 01:47:30,106
interested upon learning of the Clasp's
involvement. He also mentions the difficulty in

1566
01:47:30,106 --> 01:47:36,821
talking with Uriel since the attack, and is sad
about the death of Sir Gregory, but warns to leave

1567
01:47:36,821 --> 01:47:40,267
the investigation to the officials.

1568
01:47:40,267 --> 01:47:48,063
Vox Machina then heads to the palace to try their
hand at speaking with Uriel, but entry is barred.

1569
01:47:48,063 --> 01:47:54,627
They find another is being prevented from
entering, a golden-haired woman in fancy blue

1570
01:47:54,627 --> 01:48:01,574
robes who angrily stomps away from the palace
doors. They engage her in conversation, and she

1571
01:48:01,574 --> 01:48:10,342
reveals herself to be Allura Vysoren, a powerful
arcanist and member of the Tal'Dorei Council.

1572
01:48:10,342 --> 01:48:17,658
They discuss the state of things within the
palace, how Uriel is a good and trusted man, but

1573
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:25,113
his actions (and those of the Empress Salda) are
recently suspect. After seven days of being kept

1574
01:48:25,113 --> 01:48:31,851
from the council chambers, she's about to give up
and leave. The party tells her of their findings,

1575
01:48:31,851 --> 01:48:37,794
and Allura leads them to her tower within the
district to further discuss the matter in

1576
01:48:37,794 --> 01:48:39,213
private.

1577
01:48:39,213 --> 01:48:44,177
SAM: Within, Allura and the party make an
alliance, and Keyleth aids her in performing a

1578
01:48:44,177 --> 01:48:50,188
scrying ritual on the palace. The vision reveals
that the family of Uriel-- his wife, two

1579
01:48:50,188 --> 01:48:56,570
daughters, and son-- are all under the influence
of some demonic force, and have addled the mind of

1580
01:48:56,570 --> 01:49:00,587
their father, using him as a mouthpiece for their
plot.

1581
01:49:00,587 --> 01:49:06,586
The party decides to pay a visit to the Clasp,
using Vax and Pike's knowledge of an entrance, and

1582
01:49:06,586 --> 01:49:12,604
end up in a confrontation with Spireling Modeth
within his chambers. The battle ends with Modeth's

1583
01:49:12,604 --> 01:49:18,574
head on the floor and four strange, glowing
crystals he had been keeping now stolen by the

1584
01:49:18,574 --> 01:49:24,947
party. They attempt to leave, but are met by a
host of Clasp members and another,

1585
01:49:24,947 --> 01:49:31,595
dangerous-looking Spireling. Through Scanlan's
deft lies and coercion, the party is allowed to

1586
01:49:31,595 --> 01:49:35,092
leave unharmed before their deeds are discovered.

1587
01:49:35,092 --> 01:49:40,479
They return to Allura's tower only to find the
front door ajar and the interior tossed by some

1588
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:46,436
previous scuffle. As they reach the top of the
tower, they investigate, finding signs of a

1589
01:49:46,436 --> 01:49:53,111
struggle with a demonic entity, and Allura's
escape seemingly successful. Unfortunately, a

1590
01:49:53,111 --> 01:49:58,895
magical defense of the tower is triggered, and it
begins to cave and crumble around them. Through

1591
01:49:58,895 --> 01:50:05,600
some ingenuity-- and the discovery of a magic
carpet-- the party manages to escape being crushed

1592
01:50:05,635 --> 01:50:11,820
within, Allura's ivory monolith now compacted into
a single, magical pearl.

1593
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:18,320
Our heroes then locate and enter the home of
General Krieg, finding a brainwashed servant and a

1594
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:24,052
hidden passage that leads to a teleportation
circle. Using the device, they are transported to

1595
01:50:24,052 --> 01:50:30,610
a distant cavern, high in a range of frost-covered
mountains, and an incredible hoard of gold,

1596
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:38,980
jewels, and fine trinkets. Across the room are
four obsidian orbs placed within the rock. As one

1597
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:44,884
is touched, a giant eye appears from within the
black crystal and a voice erupts, calling for a

1598
01:50:44,884 --> 01:50:53,437
Brimscythe, and noticing the unfamiliar folk,
mentions, "Intruders... I know your face now. He

1599
01:50:53,437 --> 01:51:02,189
"is a fool, and so are you, insect." The orbs all
crack simultaneously, becoming inert.

1600
01:51:02,189 --> 01:51:08,804
Grog dives right in, rage-looting the gold, but
the arrival of the party seems to call the

1601
01:51:08,804 --> 01:51:15,077
attention of General Krieg, who appears at the
teleportation circle. He angrily denounces the

1602
01:51:15,077 --> 01:51:21,582
party and reveals his true form, that of a
frightening blue dragon!

1603
01:51:21,582 --> 01:51:27,337
MARISHA: The battle is difficult, with many an
ally nearly devoured, but eventually Vax strikes a

1604
01:51:27,337 --> 01:51:33,643
mortal blow. Krieg, or Brimscythe, defiantly
smashes against the support pillars of the cavern

1605
01:51:33,643 --> 01:51:38,974
in his death throes, causing the chamber to
collapse, the party barely escaping via the

1606
01:51:38,974 --> 01:51:40,774
teleportation circle.

1607
01:51:40,774 --> 01:51:45,887
Leaving Krieg's home, Allura finds the party and
warns that the evil that feeds on the throne is

1608
01:51:45,887 --> 01:51:51,654
growing more bold. She herself was attacked
shortly after the scrying was complete, and barely

1609
01:51:51,654 --> 01:51:53,175
escaped.

1610
01:51:53,175 --> 01:51:59,512
As dark clouds fill the sky above Emon, the party
decides the time to strike has come. Allura aids

1611
01:51:59,512 --> 01:52:05,503
the party in infiltrating the palace, and they
storm the throne room. Uriel sits upon his throne,

1612
01:52:05,503 --> 01:52:11,848
surrounded by his creepily mannered, possessed
family. Vox Machina attacks, managing to banish

1613
01:52:11,848 --> 01:52:17,092
the shadows from within their bodies, but the
throne itself cracks in half as the dais below

1614
01:52:17,092 --> 01:52:24,785
glows a deep red, summoning the entity behind the
entire scheme: a devil prince called Juurezel, who

1615
01:52:24,785 --> 01:52:30,342
tells the party of a great war between devils and
demons spilling over into this plane, threatening

1616
01:52:30,342 --> 01:52:36,810
all creation. He justifies his actions, and notes
all the demonic forces throughout the city, and

1617
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:41,582
tells them of the horrible devastation that will
ensue if the party stops him.

1618
01:52:41,582 --> 01:52:46,938
They read him as honest, and Juurezel asks for
their aid in destroying the demonic threat,

1619
01:52:46,938 --> 01:52:53,784
offering a single Wish should they make a pact.
The party deliberates and agrees to the contract.

1620
01:52:53,784 --> 01:52:59,267
Thinking over what they had just agreed to, the
party returns to the throne room, asking for their

1621
01:52:59,267 --> 01:53:05,469
Wish to be provided to aid them in their demon
hunting. Upon its casting, the party wishes to

1622
01:53:05,469 --> 01:53:08,932
cancel their contract with the creature, and
attack!

1623
01:53:08,932 --> 01:53:16,694
The devil prince angrily reveals his true form, a
hideous treachery demon, a glabrezu. A long,

1624
01:53:16,694 --> 01:53:22,799
deadly, and epic confrontation ensues, one that
suddenly claims the life of the gnomish cleric,

1625
01:53:22,799 --> 01:53:30,056
Pike. Her death fresh in their minds, Vox Machina
deals the killing blow, sending the demon to its

1626
01:53:30,056 --> 01:53:32,206
unmaking.

1627
01:53:32,206 --> 01:53:36,852
They gather up the cold body of their fallen
friend and rush her to a nearby temple of

1628
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:43,118
Sarenrae, where a resurrection ritual is
attempted... and succeeds.

1629
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:49,952
TALIESIN: The clouds disperse, the immediate
danger over, but the royal family lies on the

1630
01:53:49,952 --> 01:53:57,534
throne room floor, catatonic. Upon inspection,
their souls are missing and their bodies failing.

1631
01:53:57,534 --> 01:54:02,598
The party recalls the four glowing orbs they
recovered from the Clasp headquarters behind

1632
01:54:02,598 --> 01:54:10,191
Modeth, now identified as soul jars, and through a
rigorous and tense evening, all souls are

1633
01:54:10,191 --> 01:54:12,943
successfully restored to the family.

1634
01:54:12,943 --> 01:54:19,048
A few days pass, and Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei
calls the party for audience. He thanks them all

1635
01:54:19,048 --> 01:54:26,538
for their bravery, heroism, and for saving him,
his family, and quite possibly all of Emon. As

1636
01:54:26,538 --> 01:54:32,092
thanks, he offers them a place on the Tal'Dorei
Council and informs them of his intent to throw

1637
01:54:32,092 --> 01:54:36,909
another Winter's Crest festival to make up for the
ones ruined in Westruun, and here via

1638
01:54:36,909 --> 01:54:42,282
assassination attempt, where they will be
celebrated as heroes! He has also commissioned the

1639
01:54:42,282 --> 01:54:48,323
construction of a keep for them on the outskirts
of Emon as a sign of his very deep gratitude.

1640
01:54:48,323 --> 01:54:55,528
A week later, the festival begins! The populace is
out in full force to meet and celebrate Vox

1641
01:54:55,528 --> 01:55:02,668
Machina, but during the festivities, the party
notices Uriel's son Gren speaking to another

1642
01:55:02,668 --> 01:55:11,139
child-- one with black hair and golden eyes. They
immediately spring to apprehend the child, but he

1643
01:55:11,139 --> 01:55:17,714
escapes with Uriel's son. They give chase,
following him into an alley, and through a portal

1644
01:55:17,714 --> 01:55:19,423
of some kind.

1645
01:55:19,423 --> 01:55:25,608
The party finds themselves atop a large island
drifting through the Astral Plane, surrounded by a

1646
01:55:25,608 --> 01:55:31,627
perilous bramble forest. They fight their way
through, eventually coming upon a gothic mansion

1647
01:55:31,627 --> 01:55:37,755
towards the center of the landmass. Within, the
party makes their way to the inner library, where

1648
01:55:37,755 --> 01:55:42,945
numerous kidnapped children are working all about
the place, cleaning nervously.

1649
01:55:42,945 --> 01:55:49,588
The Dread Emperor, as he calls himself, stands
from his chair, the child illusion fading into a

1650
01:55:49,588 --> 01:55:55,495
golden-armored man with long, black hair, four
children chained at the neck to his breastplate.

1651
01:55:55,540 --> 01:56:01,299
He attacks the party with fierce magic,
mind-controlling all of his child servants to

1652
01:56:01,299 --> 01:56:07,389
attack as well. With the first blow dealt, they
realize that damaging him also hurts the chained

1653
01:56:07,389 --> 01:56:14,262
children, one boy accidentally falling in battle
to Keyleth's magic. Eventually, they succeeded in

1654
01:56:14,262 --> 01:56:20,920
destroying the Dread Emperor and return to Emon
with a host of lost children, happily now found.

1655
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:26,668
Six months of peace follow as their new keep is
constructed, and the party scatters to their

1656
01:56:26,668 --> 01:56:32,908
separate business until its completion. Upon their
return, they assess their new abode with delight,

1657
01:56:32,908 --> 01:56:39,955
naming it Greyskull Keep. They then send out job
inquiries, seeking guards for hire, and servants.

1658
01:56:39,955 --> 01:56:44,862
After an impromptu try-out, they settle upon their
new hires.

1659
01:56:44,862 --> 01:56:51,823
MATT: That evening, the party receives a visitor
in their friend Arcanist Allura Vysoren. She

1660
01:56:51,823 --> 01:56:57,594
happily sits with the party for dinner, and trades
tales of their past months, before asking if she

1661
01:56:57,594 --> 01:57:04,661
could hire their services for a matter of great
personal importance. Allura's longtime friend and

1662
01:57:04,661 --> 01:57:10,001
ally, Lady Kima of Vord, has gone missing,
following a vision quest from her deity, the

1663
01:57:10,001 --> 01:57:16,027
platinum dragon Bahamut. Her last letter spoke of
an evil taking root beneath the dwarven city of

1664
01:57:16,027 --> 01:57:23,351
Kraghammer, and Allura worries for her safety.
While Allura is unable to go herself, she can

1665
01:57:23,351 --> 01:57:29,609
provide the proper paperwork for entry, and would
pay handsomely if they could find, aid, and return

1666
01:57:29,609 --> 01:57:31,142
with Kima.

1667
01:57:31,142 --> 01:57:38,027
Vox Machina agrees to the new contract and sets
out for the city of Kraghammer the very next day.

1668
01:57:38,027 --> 01:57:46,029
As for the rest of their journey... the legend of
Vox Machina is still being written.

1669
01:58:41,247 --> 01:58:46,217
MATT: Hello! And welcome back. I hope you guys
enjoyed your little look into the past of Vox

1670
01:58:46,217 --> 01:58:52,087
Machina. Once again, thank you to everyone who
helped us with that. Huge thanks to Wendy. You

1671
01:58:52,087 --> 01:58:55,891
were amazing in putting that together for us. It's
been a long-time endeavor coming.

1672
01:58:55,891 --> 01:58:57,470
LIAM: We love you, Wendy.

1673
01:58:57,470 --> 01:59:02,089
MATT: And all the wonderful Critters that are
incredibly talented put the music together and we

1674
01:59:02,089 --> 01:59:06,781
are very thankful that you helped us fill out the
soundtrack. If you didn't catch all the names,

1675
01:59:06,781 --> 01:59:09,580
they're at the bottom of the credits and hopefully
we'll have that video up separately on the website

1676
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:15,289
soon, so people who couldn't make it tonight will
have a chance to see it for their own. That being

1677
01:59:15,289 --> 01:59:21,182
the case, when the rest of them decide they want
to join us, those who are going towards the pie

1678
01:59:21,182 --> 01:59:26,457
eating contest. You start pushing through the
crowd, making your way towards the two long tables

1679
01:59:26,457 --> 01:59:32,520
that are set up. At this, you can see there are a
pair of bakers that are standing there with stacks

1680
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:38,211
and stacks of various pies of various flavors they
have been preparing, all different colors and

1681
01:59:38,211 --> 01:59:42,619
shapes, just pushed into a pile, as people are
gathered around, excitedly sitting at the table.

1682
01:59:42,659 --> 01:59:46,240
LAURA: Is Trinket allowed to join in the pie
eating contest too?

1683
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:47,458
MATT: (laughs) You can ask.

1684
01:59:47,458 --> 01:59:50,010
LAURA: (laughs) I do.

1685
01:59:50,010 --> 01:59:54,605
MATT: Okay, one of the bakers is sitting there.
"All right, all right. So sit there, everyone's

1686
01:59:54,605 --> 01:59:56,934
"got a table. We have room for about four more."

1687
01:59:56,934 --> 01:59:57,807
LAURA: Oh.

1688
01:59:57,807 --> 01:59:59,204
LIAM: Right here.

1689
01:59:59,204 --> 02:00:00,514
MATT: "All right, three more."

1690
02:00:00,514 --> 02:00:03,702
LAURA: And a bear. Is there room for a bear?

1691
02:00:03,702 --> 02:00:06,383
MATT: "A bear. Like, a bear?"

1692
02:00:06,383 --> 02:00:09,538
LAURA: Yeah, but a very human-acting bear.

1693
02:00:09,538 --> 02:00:14,931
MATT: "Oh, sure. Bring him in. No! It's a bear!
Two more, room for two more."

1694
02:00:14,931 --> 02:00:17,140
TRAVIS: Do you want me to join?

1695
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:20,178
LIAM: Can someone transmogrify Trinket, quickly?

1696
02:00:20,178 --> 02:00:23,662
LAURA: (gasps) Can you Polymorph Trinket,
Keyleth?

1697
02:00:23,662 --> 02:00:25,980
MARISHA: Into what?

1698
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:27,016
LAURA: A human.

1699
02:00:27,016 --> 02:00:28,977
LIAM: To a hot man.

1700
02:00:28,977 --> 02:00:30,023
TALIESIN: To a lumberjack.

1701
02:00:30,023 --> 02:00:31,443
LAURA: Into a lumberjack of a man?

1702
02:00:31,443 --> 02:00:33,439
MARISHA: I don't think it works that way.

1703
02:00:33,439 --> 02:00:34,586
LAURA: Try it!

1704
02:00:34,586 --> 02:00:35,890
TALIESIN: Old Spice commercial. Make it happen.

1705
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:36,871
MATT: You can certainly try.

1706
02:00:36,871 --> 02:00:38,183
MARISHA: I try it.

1707
02:00:38,183 --> 02:00:39,685
LIAM: Winter's Crest magic!

1708
02:00:39,685 --> 02:00:43,712
MARISHA: I believe. I believe in the spirit of
Winter's Crest.

1709
02:00:43,712 --> 02:00:47,283
LAURA: Can you Polymorph Trinket into a man?

1710
02:00:47,283 --> 02:00:48,171
SAM: Sure.

1711
02:00:48,171 --> 02:00:50,262
LAURA: Scanlan says he can.

1712
02:00:50,262 --> 02:00:54,374
MARISHA: I think Scanlan actually might have a
better chance with Seeming?

1713
02:00:54,374 --> 02:00:57,819
SAM: I can Polymorph Trinket.

1714
02:00:57,819 --> 02:01:00,583
MARISHA: But can you Polymorph animals into
people?

1715
02:01:00,583 --> 02:01:04,158
MATT: Technically, you could, yeah.

1716
02:01:04,158 --> 02:01:05,082
MARISHA: I can?

1717
02:01:05,082 --> 02:01:06,795
MATT: Technically. I don't see why not.

1718
02:01:06,795 --> 02:01:16,388
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah, I'm going to make him real
beefy. He's got pecs that can lift semi-trucks.

1719
02:01:16,388 --> 02:01:17,842
All right?

1720
02:01:17,842 --> 02:01:19,060
MATT: Okay.

1721
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:24,560
MARISHA: Fur, just fur--

1722
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,779
SAM: Furry belly? What is that?

1723
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:31,816
MARISHA: Like that guy in the beginning of
Barbarella.

1724
02:01:31,816 --> 02:01:35,124
MATT: So you turned your bear into a <i>bear.</i>

1725
02:01:35,124 --> 02:01:36,730
TALIESIN: Brian Blessed.

1726
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:37,829
MARISHA: Yes.

1727
02:01:37,829 --> 02:01:40,085
LAURA: Here's my bear, right here.

1728
02:01:40,085 --> 02:01:47,430
MATT: So you rush off and you come back with
Trinket. As you can see, he's walking a little

1729
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:58,371
strange and (bear moans) Rolls up and brushes his
scruffy man beard against the side of your face.

1730
02:01:58,371 --> 02:02:03,811
You gather, Polymorph does not affect the
intellect of whatever you transform.

1731
02:02:03,811 --> 02:02:08,902
LIAM: I grab a mug of ale and go: another one,
right? Yeah! He's had so many!

1732
02:02:08,902 --> 02:02:10,530
LAURA: So drunk, this guy!

1733
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:15,609
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. Grog, do we still have
that helmet, that pot that you wore on your head,

1734
02:02:15,609 --> 02:02:17,275
in the Bag of Holding?

1735
02:02:17,275 --> 02:02:18,190
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1736
02:02:18,190 --> 02:02:19,638
MARISHA: Can we have that real quick?

1737
02:02:19,638 --> 02:02:22,642
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. So I reach in and take out the
big bronze pot.

1738
02:02:22,642 --> 02:02:24,314
MARISHA: I put the pot on his head.

1739
02:02:24,314 --> 02:02:25,677
LAURA: Why?

1740
02:02:25,677 --> 02:02:27,355
MARISHA: It's special.

1741
02:02:27,355 --> 02:02:29,501
SAM: Oh, he has a helmet head?

1742
02:02:29,501 --> 02:02:33,292
MATT: So the pot, which covers Trinket's head...
(bear moans)

1743
02:02:33,292 --> 02:02:39,618
LAURA: He does not need a pot on his head.
Trinket, have a seat in this chair like a normal

1744
02:02:39,618 --> 02:02:40,547
human.

1745
02:02:40,547 --> 02:02:42,205
TRAVIS: You can give that back to me.

1746
02:02:42,205 --> 02:02:43,041
LAURA: Here you go.

1747
02:02:43,041 --> 02:02:44,489
LIAM: I keep giving him ale.

1748
02:02:44,489 --> 02:02:53,657
MATT: Okay. (laughs) What is going on? Okay. So,
at this time, you guys have people gathered around

1749
02:02:53,657 --> 02:02:59,651
now. You guys all take your places at the table.
You have to put your feet planted, everyone

1750
02:02:59,651 --> 02:03:04,540
pushing elbow to elbow. You guys sit down amongst
yourselves in a cluster and you eventually guide

1751
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:11,403
over as your fourth at the end of your group, your
Polymorphed bear friend who's still (confused

1752
02:03:11,403 --> 02:03:19,137
moans) messing with his manly ham hands.

1753
02:03:19,137 --> 02:03:47,371
[no audio]

1754
02:03:47,371 --> 02:03:49,066
MATT: "To eat..."

1755
02:03:49,066 --> 02:03:52,438
LIAM: I do not have much confidence. You have
always eaten more than me, always.

1756
02:03:52,438 --> 02:03:58,491
MATT: "Now!" Dive in face first, arms behind you,
just tearing through these pies. Just

1757
02:03:58,491 --> 02:04:03,961
blackberries, strawberries, all forms of berries
just being tossed everywhere. There's a couple

1758
02:04:03,961 --> 02:04:04,827
chicken pies--

1759
02:04:04,827 --> 02:04:05,966
LIAM: No hands, no hands!

1760
02:04:05,966 --> 02:04:07,063
LAURA: Oh, no hands?

1761
02:04:07,063 --> 02:04:08,315
MATT: No hands, no.

1762
02:04:08,315 --> 02:04:09,491
LAURA: Trinket, no hands.

1763
02:04:09,491 --> 02:04:11,066
MATT: Trinket goes like, (inquisitive grunt).

1764
02:04:11,066 --> 02:04:12,438
LAURA: No hands! No paws!

1765
02:04:12,438 --> 02:04:15,150
MARISHA: (laughs) No paws! No paws!

1766
02:04:15,150 --> 02:04:26,065
SAM: I'm going to use Message to communicate to
Grog: If there was ever a time for a prank,

1767
02:04:26,065 --> 02:04:27,942
now is it.

1768
02:04:27,942 --> 02:04:30,236
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1769
02:04:30,236 --> 02:04:40,519
MATT: As you all tear through your first large
pies, smeared across the faces, with your mind off

1770
02:04:40,563 --> 02:04:45,613
to the side, you glance over, everyone go ahead
and make a constitution saving throw.

1771
02:04:45,662 --> 02:04:50,935
SAM: Constitution? Oh, he's going to barf.

1772
02:04:50,982 --> 02:04:52,770
LIAM: 20, Natural 20!

1773
02:04:52,823 --> 02:04:55,818
LAURA: Oh, you rattled the table, it was 15, then
it fell over.

1774
02:04:55,818 --> 02:04:57,911
LIAM: Oh, sorry, Charlie.

1775
02:04:57,911 --> 02:05:03,422
LAURA: Seven for me, because he rattled the damn
table, because he's an asshole.

1776
02:05:03,422 --> 02:05:05,131
LIAM: Yeah. Separate issues.

1777
02:05:05,131 --> 02:05:09,647
LAURA: And then Trinket rolled a 21.

1778
02:05:09,647 --> 02:05:10,863
MATT: All right, Grog?

1779
02:05:10,863 --> 02:05:11,887
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm not eating.

1780
02:05:11,887 --> 02:05:13,418
MATT: Oh, you're not eating?

1781
02:05:13,418 --> 02:05:14,814
TRAVIS: I thought it was just you two guys.

1782
02:05:14,814 --> 02:05:15,959
LAURA: It was us and Trinket.

1783
02:05:15,959 --> 02:05:21,424
MATT: Okay, all right, cool. So, the three of you
tearing through. You finish the first pie. The

1784
02:05:21,424 --> 02:05:28,337
second pies slam down, you all look at it, you
have a little moment. Close, but not too bad. You

1785
02:05:28,337 --> 02:05:32,353
gather yourself and dive into a second round of
pies, splashing all over the table.

1786
02:05:32,353 --> 02:05:34,646
LIAM: I elbow my sister, then dive into the pie.

1787
02:05:34,646 --> 02:05:38,811
MATT: (laughs) Trinket is having a hard time
keeping the hands behind. You can see one of the

1788
02:05:38,811 --> 02:05:41,930
bakers suddenly come by and hold the hands back.
(growls aggressively)

1789
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:44,137
LAURA: He's really drunk! Don't touch him too
much.

1790
02:05:44,137 --> 02:05:46,059
MATT: "All right, just keep--"

1791
02:05:46,059 --> 02:05:47,677
LAURA: No hands, Trinket.

1792
02:05:47,677 --> 02:05:51,397
LIAM: He lost half his family here, in the attack
on Whitestone.

1793
02:05:51,397 --> 02:05:58,258
MATT: More and more pie crust being tossed aside,
the table is a mess. The bakers are starting to

1794
02:05:58,258 --> 02:06:04,589
scoop off whatever is left over off to the side
into buckets. As you finish the second pie, make

1795
02:06:04,589 --> 02:06:08,264
another constitution saving throw with the DC
increasing with each progressive pie.

1796
02:06:08,264 --> 02:06:10,122
LAURA: Oh. (laughs)

1797
02:06:10,122 --> 02:06:11,087
TRAVIS: Wow.

1798
02:06:11,087 --> 02:06:12,238
LAURA: Natural one for me.

1799
02:06:12,238 --> 02:06:16,758
LIAM: Oh boy, I got a big six.

1800
02:06:16,758 --> 02:06:18,006
MATT: All right.

1801
02:06:18,006 --> 02:06:19,296
LAURA: Come on, Trinket!

1802
02:06:19,296 --> 02:06:20,351
SAM: (whispers) Luck!

1803
02:06:20,351 --> 02:06:23,468
LIAM: Yes, thank you, Scanlan. I got a big seven.

1804
02:06:23,468 --> 02:06:25,049
(laughter)

1805
02:06:25,049 --> 02:06:31,366
LAURA: 14 for Trinket. I rolled a one.

1806
02:06:31,366 --> 02:06:36,707
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so as you both finish your
secondary pie, you both sit up and look at each

1807
02:06:36,707 --> 02:06:43,426
other with dark purple berry filling down the side
of your face. You both make eye contact at the

1808
02:06:43,426 --> 02:06:51,138
same time, as you both go (vomiting sound) and
release your fresh payload into the pans before

1809
02:06:51,138 --> 02:06:57,716
you. Baker comes by, slamming the hand down.
"Disqualified!" You look around the side, you

1810
02:06:57,716 --> 02:07:00,214
aren't the only ones. A number of other
individuals have dropped out now. You're down to

1811
02:07:00,214 --> 02:07:03,685
five people at the table that are still eating,
one of which is Trinket, who finishes his second

1812
02:07:03,685 --> 02:07:10,410
pie. Food smeared all across the face, getting all
in the beard. Some of it has dribbled down into

1813
02:07:10,410 --> 02:07:14,684
the chest hair, it's a pretty terrifying sight.
Third pies are slammed down on the table.

1814
02:07:14,684 --> 02:07:18,343
These last five individuals and Trinket.
Have Trinket roll another

1815
02:07:18,343 --> 02:07:20,327
constitution saving throw.

1816
02:07:20,327 --> 02:07:22,011
MARISHA: Come on, Trink!

1817
02:07:22,011 --> 02:07:23,689
LAURA: You want to inspire him?

1818
02:07:23,689 --> 02:07:26,752
MATT: You're adding your modifier, right?

1819
02:07:26,752 --> 02:07:28,255
LAURA: 13.

1820
02:07:28,255 --> 02:07:29,970
MATT: You're adding your modifier, right?

1821
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:30,922
LAURA: What modifier?

1822
02:07:30,922 --> 02:07:31,935
MATT: His constitution modifier.

1823
02:07:31,935 --> 02:07:32,771
LAURA: Yeah.

1824
02:07:32,771 --> 02:07:45,474
MATT: All right, so this time, everyone finishes
this last pie. Two of the individuals end up

1825
02:07:45,474 --> 02:07:50,330
having to stop, just duck out, have to run off out
into the crowd. Three of them make it through,

1826
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:56,380
Trinket just barely finishes the third pie.
(gulps, distressed growls) He gives you that look

1827
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:57,779
of like, (distressed growling).

1828
02:07:57,779 --> 02:08:02,640
LAURA: Buddy. You can keep doing it! I'll give
you--

1829
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:04,080
SAM: Food?

1830
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:11,099
LAURA: I know, I got nothing. A nice nap. You can
have the bed tonight and I'll sleep on the floor.

1831
02:08:11,099 --> 02:08:17,618
MATT: (pants) He looks over and another pie is set
down, the fourth round of pies go down. The last

1832
02:08:17,618 --> 02:08:21,569
three and Trinket join in. Make another
constitution saving throw for Trinket.

1833
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:28,206
LAURA: Okay. It was almost a fucking 15. 15.

1834
02:08:28,206 --> 02:08:30,295
MATT: A 15? Total?

1835
02:08:30,295 --> 02:08:31,551
LAURA: Yeah. Oh no.

1836
02:08:31,551 --> 02:08:39,568
MATT: That set of pies finished, two of the
remaining three end up getting up partway through

1837
02:08:39,568 --> 02:08:43,890
the pie and one of them vomits off to the side.
The other one stops, stands up and walks away,

1838
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:50,654
going (distressed noises). Spits out the food in
his mouth in his hand, re-examining his life. The

1839
02:08:50,654 --> 02:09:00,219
other remaining gentleman finishes the pie.
There's sweat down his face (panting), you see the

1840
02:09:00,219 --> 02:09:03,990
little bit of a chinstrap beard he has just
covered in berries and bits of crust, this awful

1841
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:12,968
appearance. Trinket finishes the last bits of the
pie (chomp, distressed bellow).

1842
02:09:12,968 --> 02:09:15,735
LAURA: Oh, I feel so guilty right now!

1843
02:09:15,735 --> 02:09:17,892
LIAM: Why is he so good at being sad bear?

1844
02:09:17,892 --> 02:09:20,067
LAURA: I know! Don't be sad bear, be happy bear!

1845
02:09:20,067 --> 02:09:21,169
TRAVIS: 300 gold!

1846
02:09:21,169 --> 02:09:22,361
LAURA: It's just 100 gold.

1847
02:09:22,361 --> 02:09:23,967
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1848
02:09:23,967 --> 02:09:26,840
LAURA: Oh, a persuasion check for Trinket?

1849
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,874
MATT: Yeah.

1850
02:09:27,874 --> 02:09:29,127
LAURA: So he'll keep eating?

1851
02:09:29,127 --> 02:09:29,966
MATT: Yeah.

1852
02:09:29,966 --> 02:09:35,695
LAURA: Oh, buddy. 15?

1853
02:09:35,695 --> 02:09:39,031
MATT: 15. Trinket looks at you.

1854
02:09:39,031 --> 02:09:40,451
LAURA: I love you.

1855
02:09:40,451 --> 02:09:41,961
MATT: (distressed growls)

1856
02:09:41,961 --> 02:09:44,398
MARISHA: You're like a Toddlers and Tiaras mom
right now.

1857
02:09:44,398 --> 02:09:47,473
LAURA: I know. This is the worst. I'm the worst
mom.

1858
02:09:47,473 --> 02:09:52,263
MATT: Looks down and across the table, the
gentleman who's also there scoots over right in

1859
02:09:52,263 --> 02:09:59,760
front and goes, "May the best man win, eh?"
Trinket goes, (loud growl).

1860
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:03,068
LAURA: Get angry! Eat angry!

1861
02:10:03,068 --> 02:10:11,027
MATT: There are bits of pie spattering across him
on the ground. Two pies (thud) brought down in

1862
02:10:11,027 --> 02:10:14,907
front. These are not fruit pies. These are meat
pies.

1863
02:10:14,907 --> 02:10:17,046
TRAVIS: Oh! That's so wrong!

1864
02:10:17,046 --> 02:10:19,934
LAURA: That's okay, Trinket likes meat way more
than fruit.

1865
02:10:19,934 --> 02:10:23,187
MATT: Then he goes, (distressed groans, sniffs).

1866
02:10:23,187 --> 02:10:25,556
LAURA: Is it a salmon pie? He likes fish.

1867
02:10:25,556 --> 02:10:27,615
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

1868
02:10:27,615 --> 02:10:29,747
TRAVIS: With advantage, because it's meat?

1869
02:10:29,747 --> 02:10:32,866
LAURA: Beause it's salmon. It's a salmon pie, and
he loves salmon.

1870
02:10:32,866 --> 02:10:43,656
MATT: (pauses) Hold on. There do appear to be
hints of fish inside. I will grant you advantage

1871
02:10:43,656 --> 02:10:45,572
on this saving throw.

1872
02:10:45,572 --> 02:10:49,899
LAURA: Okay. Fucking balls, mother bitch.

1873
02:10:49,899 --> 02:10:52,111
MARISHA: Advantage?

1874
02:10:52,111 --> 02:10:55,530
LAURA: I did roll with advantage. 11.

1875
02:10:55,530 --> 02:11:03,072
MATT: 11. Both of them dive into their pies,
coasting through. At a certain point, Trinket

1876
02:11:03,072 --> 02:11:08,460
stops and (pants) breathes heavily in the pie. You
can see bits of it over the edge, just from the

1877
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:11,829
nostril flare, looks up at you (distressed
growl).

1878
02:11:11,829 --> 02:11:13,510
LAURA: It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

1879
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:16,099
LIAM: I instinctively move behind Vex.

1880
02:11:16,099 --> 02:11:24,303
MATT: The gentleman across the way looks up as
well and is like (pants heavily, groans). They

1881
02:11:24,303 --> 02:11:27,942
both dive into the pies together again, slowly,
trying to make their way through and then in a

1882
02:11:27,942 --> 02:11:32,857
moment, they both look up at each other and their
eyes make a connection as a look of sudden fear

1883
02:11:32,857 --> 02:11:38,772
and realization hits both of them. They both sit
up and with but a moment's notice, the two bakers

1884
02:11:38,772 --> 02:11:46,476
set down two pails at their side as both of them
simultaneously just... buckets. Losing

1885
02:11:46,476 --> 02:11:53,363
simultaneously, at which point both of them raise
their other hand mid-expulsion. "We have a tie! A

1886
02:11:53,363 --> 02:12:00,188
"victory! Both winners lasted quite a ways,
splitting the pot, that's 50 gold each." Everyone

1887
02:12:00,188 --> 02:12:01,581
cheers, yay!

1888
02:12:01,581 --> 02:12:05,003
ALL: Good job, Trinket!

1889
02:12:05,003 --> 02:12:07,604
MATT: (weary growls)

1890
02:12:07,604 --> 02:12:11,004
LAURA: You don't have to eat anything else if you
don't want to.

1891
02:12:11,004 --> 02:12:11,987
MATT: (growls)

1892
02:12:11,987 --> 02:12:12,929
LAURA: Okay.

1893
02:12:12,929 --> 02:12:14,181
TRAVIS: He gets to sleep on the bed.

1894
02:12:14,181 --> 02:12:16,950
LAURA: You get to sleep on the bed and I will
sleep on the damn floor.

1895
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:19,566
MATT: Trinket steps up and pushes away from the
guy and goes running towards you on his

1896
02:12:19,566 --> 02:12:21,068
hands and knees.

1897
02:12:21,068 --> 02:12:23,273
(laughter)

1898
02:12:23,273 --> 02:12:27,179
MATT: (growls) Everyone goes like "Whoa-- " as he
runs by and starts nuzzling you.

1899
02:12:27,179 --> 02:12:31,594
LAURA: Oh, this guy. This guy is so drunk!

1900
02:12:31,594 --> 02:12:33,857
TRAVIS: There was some mold in those pies!

1901
02:12:33,857 --> 02:12:38,632
MATT: The baker hands you a sack of gold. "For
your friend."

1902
02:12:38,632 --> 02:12:39,734
LAURA: Thank you.

1903
02:12:39,734 --> 02:12:41,340
MATT: When he's feeling better.

1904
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:43,733
TALIESIN: My favorite kind of pie.

1905
02:12:43,733 --> 02:12:48,461
LIAM: I come over to my sister with two big mugs
of ale and hand one to her and say, here, don't

1906
02:12:48,461 --> 02:12:51,566
swallow the first one, just swish around and spit
it out, then the rest.

1907
02:12:51,566 --> 02:12:55,232
LAURA: Okay.

1908
02:12:55,232 --> 02:12:57,550
LIAM: That's a good one.

1909
02:12:57,550 --> 02:13:00,521
(laughter)

1910
02:13:00,521 --> 02:13:05,678
MATT: At this point, you can now hear voices start
to raise, people going, "Oh, the Keeper, the

1911
02:13:05,678 --> 02:13:09,075
"Keeper's going to speak." The people start
gathering towards the center of town where the Sun

1912
02:13:09,075 --> 02:13:18,384
Tree is. As you all begin to gather for this
central moment of the festival, Keeper Yennen

1913
02:13:18,384 --> 02:13:24,820
steps up. Cassandra steps up with him and you can
see he's looking over the crowd, eventually

1914
02:13:24,820 --> 02:13:27,328
meeting Percy's gaze.

1915
02:13:27,328 --> 02:13:29,809
TALIESIN: All right.

1916
02:13:29,809 --> 02:13:35,457
MATT: He leads you up onto the stage. The three of
you stand out amongst the rest of the crowd as

1917
02:13:35,457 --> 02:13:39,702
everyone gathers. The children are sitting in the
front, expectantly with their hands under their

1918
02:13:39,702 --> 02:13:44,322
legs, looking up with big smiles. Some of them are
covered in candy and whatever else they've managed

1919
02:13:44,322 --> 02:13:49,216
to acquire throughout the festival. The music
begins to slowly die down until silence hits and a

1920
02:13:49,216 --> 02:13:53,893
small cold breeze begins to blow through, as you
see a couple of fresh flakes of snow begin to fall

1921
02:13:53,893 --> 02:13:56,738
from the sky above Whitestone.

1922
02:13:56,738 --> 02:14:06,241
The Keeper looks out over the crowd as the hush
takes the rest of the group. "Friends, families,

1923
02:14:06,241 --> 02:14:17,876
"brave soldiers and defenders of this wondrous
city. We gather today to celebrate for the first

1924
02:14:17,876 --> 02:14:28,091
"time in many years, our own Winter's Crest
festival." There's some clapping. "It is on this

1925
02:14:28,091 --> 02:14:38,354
"day that we remember, centuries ago, when Erevan,
the Ice King, Keeper of the Far Realm of Ice and

1926
02:14:38,354 --> 02:14:47,293
'the Elemental Planes, attempted to tear his way
into Tal'Dorei, was kept at bay and sent back

1927
02:14:47,293 --> 02:15:01,019
"packing from whence he came." There are some
cheers from the crowd. "In this, we also are

1928
02:15:01,019 --> 02:15:09,079
"reminded of family, reminded of friendship, and
the bonds that we as a people keep ourselves and

1929
02:15:09,079 --> 02:15:19,172
"our families safe, that we rise up to the occasion
to show true heroism. To stand by our beliefs and

1930
02:15:19,172 --> 02:15:28,298
"not let the darkness swallow our hope. And by
that, we are able to bring to you, this day, the

1931
02:15:28,298 --> 02:15:33,581
"surviving members of the de Rolo family: Cassandra
and Percival."

1932
02:15:33,581 --> 02:15:39,855
You hear some whistles from the crowd and some
cheers well up again. Some shouts, "de Rolo!"

1933
02:15:39,855 --> 02:15:50,272
some yells from the crowd. Keeper Yennen puts his
arms out. "These two, among friends, Vox Machina,

1934
02:15:50,272 --> 02:16:00,554
"the intrepid adventurers from Emon, spearheaded
our freedom, from the terrible, tyrant ruin that

1935
02:16:00,554 --> 02:16:07,341
"the Briarwoods had set us upon. So today, we
celebrate not just our joint friendships. We

1936
02:16:07,341 --> 02:16:17,404
"celebrate true heroism and give thanks that there
are still"-- looking to you, Percy-- "people who

1937
02:16:17,404 --> 02:16:25,644
"will do whatever it takes to rise to the good of
this land." He looks to Cassandra. "Who in the

1938
02:16:25,644 --> 02:16:33,411
"long run, know the right choices to make and
amongst the darkness, still choose sight of the

1939
02:16:33,411 --> 02:16:43,671
"light. May we all raise our glasses to the
prosperous future of this city amongst the

1940
02:16:43,671 --> 02:16:48,580
"Alabaster Sierras and to the continued future of
the de Rolo family."

1941
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:52,827
Everyone raises their glasses up. "Huzzah!"

1942
02:16:52,827 --> 02:16:55,100
(cheering)

1943
02:16:55,100 --> 02:17:00,913
MATT: Cheers, everyone drinks, the music swells
again, people begin to cheer and scatter and

1944
02:17:00,956 --> 02:17:08,646
Keeper Yennen leads you guys off of the stage. The
rest of you gather up as some people come up and

1945
02:17:08,646 --> 02:17:14,780
shake hands and express their gratitude and
thanks. As the crowd begins to die off a little

1946
02:17:14,780 --> 02:17:26,040
bit, Keeper Yennen gives you all a look and
beckons you over. "If you wouldn't mind, a moment

1947
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:29,845
"of your time. I think there are a few things we
need to discuss."

1948
02:17:29,845 --> 02:17:31,560
TALIESIN: Of course.

1949
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:37,845
MATT: "Cassandra?" She comes as well. And you all
step off out of the festival for a while. A few

1950
02:17:37,845 --> 02:17:41,192
folks attempt to follow to see what's going on.
Some of the guards usher them away. You guys are

1951
02:17:41,192 --> 02:17:47,141
led into an empty building, looks to have been a
home of some kind that has long since been

1952
02:17:47,141 --> 02:17:53,455
abandoned. As you step inside, it's cold and still
in here, very low light other than a little oil

1953
02:17:53,455 --> 02:18:00,919
lantern that's been lit by one of the guards as
you step inside. The door closes behind and Keeper

1954
02:18:00,919 --> 02:18:07,779
Yennen turns around. "There is no real way that we
can show our appreciation for what you've done for

1955
02:18:07,779 --> 02:18:19,232
"our people. But first and foremost, there are
funds within the de Rolo family treasury left

1956
02:18:19,232 --> 02:18:26,657
"behind by the Briarwoods that we hope could help
compensate for some of your expenditures and

1957
02:18:26,657 --> 02:18:28,703
'hardships you've undergone."

1958
02:18:28,703 --> 02:18:30,586
LAURA: So many, just so many.

1959
02:18:30,586 --> 02:18:36,058
MATT: "This is, of course, at the behest of the de
Rolo family,

1960
02:18:36,058 --> 02:18:38,506
"who are the inheritors of this fortune."

1961
02:18:38,506 --> 02:18:40,012
MARISHA: Thanks, Percy.

1962
02:18:40,012 --> 02:18:41,932
LAURA: Percival, you're looking very attractive
today.

1963
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:43,223
TALIESIN: I know.

1964
02:18:43,223 --> 02:18:45,911
TRAVIS: Very appropriate.

1965
02:18:45,911 --> 02:18:57,652
MATT: "Now, we've had a few weeks of peace and
recovery, of rebuilding and reforging the real

1966
02:18:57,652 --> 02:19:05,294
"bonds of this society here in Whitestone. But
going forward, there needs to be a governing

1967
02:19:05,294 --> 02:19:16,541
"force. I would like to ask of your wisdom and
guidance, all of you, in deciding on what is to

1968
02:19:16,541 --> 02:19:27,082
"become of the future of this city. There are many
options at our disposal. I'm overseeing a myriad

1969
02:19:27,082 --> 02:19:34,690
"of things throughout the town and as a man of
religious importance, given the history, the

1970
02:19:34,690 --> 02:19:40,322
"people have recommended it does not behoove me to
take any sort of position of ruling in this town.

1971
02:19:40,322 --> 02:19:46,927
"It would be natural, of course, for the people to,
without question, follow anyone of the existing

1972
02:19:46,927 --> 02:19:52,365
"bloodline." He looks both to Cassandra and to
Percival. "Have you any thoughts on this matter?

1973
02:19:52,365 --> 02:19:54,902
"Any of you?"

1974
02:19:54,902 --> 02:20:04,738
SAM: Of our members, only this one human over here
on his hands and knees, is the expendable one of

1975
02:20:04,738 --> 02:20:05,708
our group.

1976
02:20:05,708 --> 02:20:06,745
LAURA: Hey.

1977
02:20:06,745 --> 02:20:12,251
MATT: At which point, the strange, burly man on
all fours, at this point, Brother-- who did not

1978
02:20:12,251 --> 02:20:17,808
really notice, goes, "Is that your bear?"

1979
02:20:17,808 --> 02:20:20,129
(laughter)

1980
02:20:20,129 --> 02:20:21,273
LAURA: Maybe.

1981
02:20:21,273 --> 02:20:23,129
TALIESIN: Yes.

1982
02:20:23,129 --> 02:20:25,012
MATT: "Strange folk. "

1983
02:20:25,012 --> 02:20:31,404
SAM: I don't think any of us would-- well, Percy,
if you'd like to stay and rule?

1984
02:20:31,404 --> 02:20:33,838
LIAM: Freddy, this is everything you've worked
for.

1985
02:20:33,838 --> 02:20:36,877
SAM: This is your birthright and you've earned
it.

1986
02:20:36,877 --> 02:20:40,753
TALIESIN: It was really not my birthright. I was
not raised to rule.

1987
02:20:40,753 --> 02:20:43,991
SAM: But you would be a fantastic ruler.

1988
02:20:43,991 --> 02:20:48,673
MARISHA: And also sometimes, those birthrights are
thrust upon us.

1989
02:20:48,673 --> 02:21:01,243
TALIESIN: I still have work to do outside the
city. Ripley's still on the loose and knows far

1990
02:21:01,243 --> 02:21:13,022
too much. And I feel more than a little
responsible for her and what she may do. Honestly,

1991
02:21:13,022 --> 02:21:17,008
Cassandra had a better upbringing than I did for
this sort of work.

1992
02:21:17,008 --> 02:21:23,262
MATT: At which point, Cassandra pipes up and goes,
"Well, I understand what you're saying, brother,

1993
02:21:23,262 --> 02:21:34,158
"but I'm still rediscovering who I am. If the
people of this town knew what I've done, what I

1994
02:21:34,158 --> 02:21:37,209
"was responsible for all these years."

1995
02:21:37,209 --> 02:21:44,748
MARISHA: You mean surviving being held hostage,
surviving an ambush and being pelted with arrows?

1996
02:21:44,748 --> 02:21:51,629
TALIESIN: They expect better of us, I know. I
understand. We are held to a different standard.

1997
02:21:51,629 --> 02:22:12,207
And it's difficult. Perhaps it's time for a
council. Perhaps it's time for shared rule. There

1998
02:22:12,207 --> 02:22:22,997
should always be a de Rolo in Whitestone, but
perhaps we could share the weight.

1999
02:22:22,997 --> 02:22:26,779
MATT: "We could. I could."

2000
02:22:26,779 --> 02:22:30,874
TALIESIN: Yennen, would you be comfortable sharing
some of this burden?

2001
02:22:30,874 --> 02:22:39,906
MATT: He's taken aback and thinks. "Well, in the
sense of a council that you're recommending, that

2002
02:22:39,906 --> 02:22:47,551
"would be certainly a more comfortable position for
one such as myself. There are a number of

2003
02:22:47,551 --> 02:22:58,942
"community leaders that have really stepped up and
shown their true quality. Yes, this could be done.

2004
02:22:58,942 --> 02:23:07,129
"We'd have to ask the people, of course, of the
city and make sure that that would be all right

2005
02:23:07,129 --> 02:23:14,274
"with the folks, but I think given the way things
have been, that shouldn't be too hard of a sell."

2006
02:23:14,274 --> 02:23:19,616
LAURA: Do the de Rolos still stay in the giant
castle? Or does that go to somebody else, then?

2007
02:23:19,616 --> 02:23:23,433
TALIESIN: I think the de Rolos keep the castle,
but I think we use the castle to--

2008
02:23:23,433 --> 02:23:31,755
SAM: Wait, would you be on this council? And who
would they be counseling? Is there no superior

2009
02:23:31,755 --> 02:23:35,088
primate? Is there no, there's no--

2010
02:23:35,088 --> 02:23:39,406
MATT: "I believe what he's suggesting is that we
make decisions by council, by vote."

2011
02:23:39,406 --> 02:23:41,581
SAM: A triumvirate.

2012
02:23:41,581 --> 02:23:42,929
MATT: "If you will."

2013
02:23:42,929 --> 02:23:44,258
TALIESIN: Quintumverate.

2014
02:23:44,258 --> 02:23:45,202
SAM: Oh, four people?

2015
02:23:45,202 --> 02:23:46,155
TALIESIN: Five.

2016
02:23:46,155 --> 02:23:47,781
TRAVIS: A flatterdesplat.

2017
02:23:47,781 --> 02:23:50,096
SAM: Flibbertigibbit.

2018
02:23:50,152 --> 02:23:54,356
TALIESIN: A religious leader, someone from the
farming communities, someone from the economic

2019
02:23:54,356 --> 02:23:56,809
community, someone from the trade community--

2020
02:23:56,809 --> 02:23:58,377
SAM: Someone from the gnome community.

2021
02:23:58,377 --> 02:23:59,491
TALIESIN: From the citizenry.

2022
02:23:59,491 --> 02:24:02,555
SAM: From the gnome community.

2023
02:24:02,555 --> 02:24:04,772
TALIESIN: From some known community, yes.

2024
02:24:04,772 --> 02:24:07,433
SAM: I accept.

2025
02:24:07,433 --> 02:24:19,839
TALIESIN: Interests will be thought of and there
will always be a noble to be a tiebreaker when

2026
02:24:19,839 --> 02:24:28,035
necessary and to judge from a place of (sighs)
greater good.

2027
02:24:28,035 --> 02:24:37,943
MATT: "Cassandra?" She steps back at this point
and she looks, her hands shaking visibly. She

2028
02:24:37,943 --> 02:24:42,466
looks up to you and steps forward and reaches up
and puts her hand to the side of your face and

2029
02:24:42,466 --> 02:24:57,259
looks to you with a piercing honesty and fear. She,
lower lip quivering, whispers to you. "Percy,

2030
02:24:57,259 --> 02:25:02,119
"can I be trusted? Do you trust me?"

2031
02:25:02,119 --> 02:25:07,163
TALIESIN: All things considered, I think that
you're more trustworthy than I am, at this point.

2032
02:25:07,163 --> 02:25:13,699
Let's not forget that I was the one who let you
down first.

2033
02:25:13,699 --> 02:25:17,667
I'm going to give her one of the stones.

2034
02:25:17,667 --> 02:25:23,978
LAURA: We were-- no, that was for the whole group!
That was for the whole group, Percival.

2035
02:25:23,978 --> 02:25:26,634
MATT: "What is this?"

2036
02:25:26,634 --> 02:25:30,724
SAM: It's done.

2037
02:25:30,724 --> 02:25:33,282
LIAM: Leave it alone.

2038
02:25:33,282 --> 02:25:36,073
LAURA: (muffled) That's was going to save your
fucking life later.

2039
02:25:36,073 --> 02:25:39,744
TALIESIN: You're going to be so happy when we have
instant access to the treasury.

2040
02:25:39,744 --> 02:25:41,163
LAURA: All right.

2041
02:25:41,163 --> 02:25:51,586
TALIESIN: If anything bad should happen, if
there's any need of quick retreat or quick

2042
02:25:51,586 --> 02:26:00,513
communication, this is a one-way trip to us. And
in return, this is a one-way trip for us to you,

2043
02:26:00,513 --> 02:26:02,785
in case of emergency.

2044
02:26:02,785 --> 02:26:08,590
MATT: She clasps it in her hand, holds it to her
chest.

2045
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:19,096
TALIESIN: You were born for this. You were
instructed in how to do this, where I never was.

2046
02:26:19,096 --> 02:26:22,801
LAURA: And now you've got four other people
keeping an eye on you.

2047
02:26:22,801 --> 02:26:32,450
MATT: She smiles and closes her eyes. "What you
say is true." She looks over at each member of

2048
02:26:32,450 --> 02:26:44,286
your group and looks back to Keeper Yennen. "If it
so pleases this intended council, It would be my

2049
02:26:44,286 --> 02:26:50,423
"honor to represent the de Rolo bloodline in
keeping this town safe."

2050
02:26:50,423 --> 02:26:58,315
Keeper goes, "Then so be it. I shall inquire with
the people of this town. We will forge a council

2051
02:26:58,315 --> 02:27:10,172
"voted by the greater peoples of this place. And we
shall restore Whitestone to its former glory. Very

2052
02:27:10,172 --> 02:27:15,375
"well. Go, enjoy the rest of your festival."

2053
02:27:15,375 --> 02:27:21,344
SAM: What was that cash prize? You had mentioned
some sort of--

2054
02:27:21,344 --> 02:27:23,514
MATT: "Well, talk with Percival."

2055
02:27:23,514 --> 02:27:24,787
TALIESIN: I will organize--

2056
02:27:24,787 --> 02:27:29,356
LAURA: Oh, you have to give it to us? It has to
come from you? That feels shady.

2057
02:27:29,356 --> 02:27:37,112
TALIESIN: Let's not forget that within six hours
of meeting each other, I ended up handing over an

2058
02:27:37,112 --> 02:27:39,268
enormous sum of money to you.

2059
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:40,894
LAURA: It was actually 500 gold.

2060
02:27:40,894 --> 02:27:51,031
TALIESIN: It was quite a bit of gold, if I recall.
You have it written down, don't you? That's so

2061
02:27:51,031 --> 02:27:52,588
endearing.

2062
02:27:52,588 --> 02:27:54,494
LIAM: Is it?

2063
02:27:54,494 --> 02:27:58,831
(laughter)

2064
02:27:58,831 --> 02:28:06,186
MATT: "Very well. Enjoy your festival, you've
earned it. Go out, be merry. Let us all remember

2065
02:28:06,186 --> 02:28:17,746
"this time of year, the bonds that we carry, the
loyalties that we hold to, and the heroism you

2066
02:28:17,746 --> 02:28:23,985
"stand for. Now go." At which point, the guards
open the door and he steps out. The cold air

2067
02:28:23,985 --> 02:28:27,388
rushes in, and you can see now, quite a bit of
soft snowfall is now coming upon

2068
02:28:27,388 --> 02:28:29,406
the center of the town.

2069
02:28:29,406 --> 02:28:33,276
LIAM: I'm sorry, is there a washroom here? My
sister's a little drunk and managed to yak on me a

2070
02:28:33,276 --> 02:28:36,348
bit and I would really love to wash up a bit.
Anywhere nearby?

2071
02:28:36,348 --> 02:28:43,121
MATT: He points off to the side. There's a small
bucket of cold water that's set by the side.

2072
02:28:43,121 --> 02:28:45,084
LIAM: Okay, I use it.

2073
02:28:45,084 --> 02:28:50,824
MATT: You manage to dampen your outfit to the
point of getting it off, although it is a bit cold

2074
02:28:50,824 --> 02:28:52,534
when you step outside now.

2075
02:28:52,534 --> 02:28:55,359
LAURA: Can I follow him for a moment?

2076
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:56,826
MATT: Sure.

2077
02:28:56,826 --> 02:29:01,677
LAURA: I haven't talked to you very much lately.

2078
02:29:01,677 --> 02:29:05,254
LIAM: No, you haven't.

2079
02:29:05,254 --> 02:29:15,903
LAURA: You seem a bit off. Yeah. What's going on?

2080
02:29:15,903 --> 02:29:23,418
LIAM: Nothing. I'm tired. We can relax for the
first time in weeks.

2081
02:29:23,418 --> 02:29:29,714
LAURA: I noticed your girlfriend isn't talking to
you. Did you do something?

2082
02:29:29,714 --> 02:29:42,368
LIAM: I will tell you just about everything, but I
don't think I want to talk about that.

2083
02:29:42,368 --> 02:29:50,189
LAURA: All right. I leave, as well.

2084
02:29:50,189 --> 02:29:55,799
MATT: All right. As the rest of the party joins,
you all step out into the cold afternoon air. You

2085
02:29:55,799 --> 02:30:01,218
are immediately greeted by the sound of music,
laughter, and cheer. The rest of the festival

2086
02:30:01,218 --> 02:30:08,935
continues on into dusk and you can't help but find
the joy in the air infectious.

2087
02:30:08,935 --> 02:30:10,871
MARISHA: Percy.

2088
02:30:10,871 --> 02:30:12,995
TALIESIN: Yes?

2089
02:30:12,995 --> 02:30:15,505
MARISHA: I actually have a present for you.

2090
02:30:15,505 --> 02:30:19,752
TALIESIN: Really?

2091
02:30:19,752 --> 02:30:25,521
MARISHA: Yeah, it comes with a story.

2092
02:30:25,521 --> 02:30:27,937
TALIESIN: (laughs) All right.

2093
02:30:27,937 --> 02:30:32,819
MARISHA: You're the only one I-- should we go get
drinks? Maybe we should go get drinks first. Let's

2094
02:30:32,819 --> 02:30:35,261
go get drinks and then I'll give you your
present.

2095
02:30:35,261 --> 02:30:36,781
TALIESIN: All right. In that case--

2096
02:30:36,781 --> 02:30:39,067
MARISHA: Alcohol makes everything better.

2097
02:30:39,067 --> 02:30:41,350
TALIESIN: Alcohol does make everything better.

2098
02:30:41,350 --> 02:30:46,723
LAURA: Speaking of presents, even though you're
being kind of a dick.

2099
02:30:46,723 --> 02:30:49,475
LIAM: Wow, you ran fast to catch up with me.

2100
02:30:49,475 --> 02:30:58,383
LAURA: I was going to buy you something, but then
I realized sometimes old is better than new.

2101
02:30:58,383 --> 02:31:02,352
SAM: It's an old person.

2102
02:31:02,352 --> 02:31:04,387
(laughter)

2103
02:31:04,387 --> 02:31:05,686
MATT: Vox Machina's favorite!

2104
02:31:05,686 --> 02:31:06,661
MARISHA: Kill it!

2105
02:31:06,661 --> 02:31:08,425
LIAM: Already dead.

2106
02:31:08,425 --> 02:31:20,252
LAURA: You know what that is?

2107
02:31:20,277 --> 02:31:29,070
MATT: As you open the package, you see before you,
a familiar belt of leather, with a coiled snake on

2108
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:33,270
the buckle.

2109
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:35,508
SAM: How did you get that?!

2110
02:31:35,508 --> 02:31:37,209
LAURA: I've got ways.

2111
02:31:37,209 --> 02:31:40,251
SAM: It was in Uriel's palace, wasn't it?

2112
02:31:40,251 --> 02:31:42,908
LAURA: I'm a really good winker, if you haven't
noticed.

2113
02:31:42,908 --> 02:31:44,137
TRAVIS: She is.

2114
02:31:44,137 --> 02:31:50,416
SAM: Did you wink somebody for that? You slutty
little thing.

2115
02:31:50,416 --> 02:31:52,280
LAURA: (laughs)

2116
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:56,381
LIAM: Hello, Simon. (slithering sound)

2117
02:31:56,381 --> 02:31:58,816
(laughter)

2118
02:31:58,816 --> 02:32:02,548
SAM: Oh no, it's just a real snake, it's biting
you!

2119
02:32:02,548 --> 02:32:06,887
TRAVIS: Revenge achieved!

2120
02:32:06,887 --> 02:32:25,222
LIAM: I am too embarrassed to look her in the eye,
and stare for a moment, but then finally, still

2121
02:32:25,222 --> 02:32:32,901
not looking at her because she's fucking freaking
me out, pull her into a hug and say, I love you,

2122
02:32:32,901 --> 02:32:43,987
Stubby. I'm never going to leave your side, I'm
always going to be there. You can always be a pain

2123
02:32:43,987 --> 02:32:53,411
in the ass like you are. I love you. Always have,
always will. Thank you.

2124
02:32:53,411 --> 02:32:56,964
LAURA: Thank you. And then I slap him across the face.

2125
02:32:57,006 --> 02:33:00,000
LIAM: What the fuck was that for?

2126
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:05,071
LAURA: I love you, too.

2127
02:33:05,071 --> 02:33:17,179
MARISHA: When I was helping the farmers clean up,
I had this strange moment where I was walking

2128
02:33:17,179 --> 02:33:22,169
through the field and saw a dead raven.

2129
02:33:22,169 --> 02:33:23,819
SAM: Here it is.

2130
02:33:23,819 --> 02:33:33,707
MARISHA: (laughs) More or less. It caught my
attention and it made me think about the past

2131
02:33:33,707 --> 02:33:41,612
several weeks, what we've been through and
everything. Don't know-- who knows, it probably

2132
02:33:41,612 --> 02:33:48,918
died, actually, in the rebellion. Maybe my ice
storm killed it or something.

2133
02:33:48,918 --> 02:33:51,193
TALIESIN: You're doing very well.

2134
02:33:51,193 --> 02:34:06,407
MARISHA: Thanks. I was looking at it and it
reminded me of everything and I feel like I was

2135
02:34:06,407 --> 02:34:13,142
instantly trying to forget about everything
because I don't want to remember. But we should.

2136
02:34:13,142 --> 02:34:26,256
And I don't want to remember you the way you were.
Because it was scary, and I didn't like it. I like

2137
02:34:26,256 --> 02:34:42,342
you now. So I took the dead bird and cleaned it
and kept its skull and put it in this box for you,

2138
02:34:42,342 --> 02:34:56,149
as a reminder of what you could have become. What
any of us could have become, really, at any time.

2139
02:34:56,149 --> 02:35:03,600
Because we shouldn't forget.

2140
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:07,775
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2141
02:35:07,775 --> 02:35:14,990
MARISHA: It's a little macabre and I would have
bought things, but we're out of money.

2142
02:35:14,990 --> 02:35:19,169
TALIESIN: I won't forget.

2143
02:35:19,169 --> 02:35:26,442
MARISHA: I'm glad that's not you.

2144
02:35:26,442 --> 02:35:39,638
TALIESIN: I can't even think of what the revenge
felt like anymore. It's not... it doesn't weigh on

2145
02:35:39,638 --> 02:35:43,138
me. Just regret.

2146
02:35:43,138 --> 02:35:47,794
MARISHA: Regret?

2147
02:35:47,794 --> 02:35:57,122
TALIESIN: Of how much better I could have been.
Thank you. I will try to be better.

2148
02:35:57,122 --> 02:36:04,821
MARISHA: No better than you could have been.
There's still a lot to come, you know.

2149
02:36:04,821 --> 02:36:06,940
TALIESIN: That's my plan.

2150
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:17,384
MARISHA: I think we all wish we were better than
we could have been. Seeing that bird, I'm sure the

2151
02:36:17,384 --> 02:36:22,836
bird felt the same way. But fuck it, he's dead
now.

2152
02:36:22,836 --> 02:36:26,259
TALIESIN: (laughs) You're strange, you know that?

2153
02:36:26,259 --> 02:36:27,656
MARISHA: I know, I'm sorry.

2154
02:36:27,656 --> 02:36:30,944
TALIESIN: No, we like it. Don't change.

2155
02:36:30,944 --> 02:36:34,083
MARISHA: I'm glad you didn't change.

2156
02:36:34,083 --> 02:36:42,700
SAM: Grog, I got you an Amazon gift card. It's a
forest called the Amazon. You can go there and get

2157
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:43,889
a gift.

2158
02:36:43,889 --> 02:36:45,291
TRAVIS: Is it far?

2159
02:36:45,291 --> 02:36:47,097
SAM: Oh, really far, you'll never use it.

2160
02:36:47,097 --> 02:36:52,725
TRAVIS: Re-gift!

2161
02:36:52,725 --> 02:36:58,802
LIAM: Well guys, Vox Machina is now free and clear
of all evil influence.

2162
02:36:58,802 --> 02:37:00,652
(laughter)

2163
02:37:00,652 --> 02:37:04,274
MARISHA: No shadowy demons. Feels good.

2164
02:37:04,274 --> 02:37:06,390
TRAVIS: Feels good!

2165
02:37:06,390 --> 02:37:10,389
MATT: With that, Vox Machina continues to enjoy
the joyous affair that is the Winter's Crest

2166
02:37:10,389 --> 02:37:20,508
festival. Snowfall slowly covering the night sky
as the sun comes to dusk. You withdraw to tell

2167
02:37:20,508 --> 02:37:24,953
stories, sing songs, and drink merrily as the
friends you are, looking forward to the next

2168
02:37:24,953 --> 02:37:29,947
chapter in your adventure. And with that, we're
going to go ahead and close the Winter's Crest

2169
02:37:29,947 --> 02:37:36,267
episode of our adventure and leave you guys to the
holiday break. We have a couple cool announcements

2170
02:37:36,267 --> 02:37:41,789
to make. One, we had our winner earlier from our
subscriber count, we hit a hundred. Our winner, if

2171
02:37:41,789 --> 02:37:44,773
they haven't already announced it, is
Saxecutioner.

2172
02:37:44,773 --> 02:37:46,750
SAM: Saxecutioner.

2173
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:55,282
MATT: You'll get yourself a cool care package
we're going to ship out to you.

2174
02:37:55,282 --> 02:37:57,630
MARISHA: I think the Boonzy Arts candle is going
out.

2175
02:37:57,630 --> 02:37:58,700
MATT: Yes!

2176
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:01,322
TALIESIN: Boonzy Arts candle. Scent-sy
Saxecutioner.

2177
02:38:01,322 --> 02:38:07,302
MATT: Indeed, indeed. Let's see, we'll be gone for
a few weeks until we come back for our next

2178
02:38:07,302 --> 02:38:10,099
episode. We're on our holiday break, we're going
to get our stuff taken care of, but we'll be back

2179
02:38:10,099 --> 02:38:11,254
as soon as we can.

2180
02:38:11,254 --> 02:38:12,700
LAURA: Do we know what date that is going to be
at?

2181
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:15,183
LIAM: I mean, we come back next Thursday, right?
Again, right? We play again every week. Every

2182
02:38:15,183 --> 02:38:16,583
Thursday.

2183
02:38:16,583 --> 02:38:18,666
ZAC: The seventh.

2184
02:38:18,666 --> 02:38:23,959
MATT: The seventh. And I think Zac has something
you wanted to mention.

2185
02:38:23,959 --> 02:38:26,210
TALIESIN: Did you have a thing, Zac?

2186
02:38:26,210 --> 02:38:28,923
MATT: Come on in, buddy.

2187
02:38:28,923 --> 02:38:36,035
ZAC: So, I have fairly serious announcement, I
guess. Hopefully our cameraman Ryan already left

2188
02:38:36,035 --> 02:38:41,094
for Star Wars. And sorry to like pull the rug out
from under you guys, but this is officially my last

2189
02:38:41,128 --> 02:38:50,665
Critical Role in person. I have been hired to be
CEO of a new media company in collaboration with

2190
02:38:50,665 --> 02:38:57,216
Harebrained Schemes, up in Seattle. And I start on
January first. So, this is my last one, so I just

2191
02:38:57,216 --> 02:39:02,619
wanted to tell you guys, thank you. Thank you to
the community. This has been one of the most

2192
02:39:02,619 --> 02:39:08,514
amazing years of my life. It's been really cool to
see what we've accomplished as a community, as a

2193
02:39:08,514 --> 02:39:15,458
group, being cool on the internet and not dicks
has been really cool. As an audience, like you

2194
02:39:15,458 --> 02:39:20,905
guys and all of us and the amount of money we've
been able to raise for charity. I can promise you

2195
02:39:20,905 --> 02:39:28,051
that the channel's fine, the shows are fine.
Lucas will be taking over the commander-in-chief

2196
02:39:28,051 --> 02:39:30,227
position, so Lucas!

2197
02:39:30,227 --> 02:39:31,375
MARISHA: Lucas!

2198
02:39:31,375 --> 02:39:32,626
TALIESIN: Lucas!

2199
02:39:32,626 --> 02:39:34,920
ZAC: Most people don't know--

2200
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:37,455
MARISHA: The man behind the curtain.

2201
02:39:37,455 --> 02:39:40,144
ZAC: The man that runs the boards. So Lucas is
getting a promotion.

2202
02:39:40,144 --> 02:39:41,579
MATT: Yes.

2203
02:39:41,579 --> 02:39:43,150
ZAC: He's back there.

2204
02:39:43,150 --> 02:39:45,478
LAURA: I see his legs. He's not walking this way.

2205
02:39:45,478 --> 02:39:52,909
ZAC: He's not moving. Tomorrow, we're going to
have a big party. It's going to be my last stream

2206
02:39:52,909 --> 02:39:58,711
on Geek and Sundry. It's going to be a big party
to celebrate. It'll be a lot of fun.

2207
02:39:58,711 --> 02:40:04,101
We're going to do some dancing, we'll have
some special guests coming by. And he's going to

2208
02:40:04,101 --> 02:40:08,514
widen the camera just so he can get in the shot.
We're also going to be knighting Lucas tomorrow

2209
02:40:08,514 --> 02:40:13,334
night, so you guys should definitely tune in for
that and watch us knight Lucas. We've been

2210
02:40:13,334 --> 02:40:19,831
training him up, getting him ready. But again,
thank you everyone for this amazing experience.

2211
02:40:19,831 --> 02:40:26,734
You can follow me on Twitter if you want to know
more about what's coming up. It'll be in a couple

2212
02:40:26,734 --> 02:40:31,529
of months, we'll be launching that and I'll make
sure to keep streaming on my channel and Lucas, of

2213
02:40:31,529 --> 02:40:37,022
course, will continue the spirit. We'll still be
in communication, everything's good. So you know.

2214
02:40:37,022 --> 02:40:38,809
(laughter)

2215
02:40:38,809 --> 02:40:43,225
ZAC: There's no hard feelings at all. I'm not
dumping a load of shit on him and walking away.

2216
02:40:43,225 --> 02:40:44,488
LUCAS: We'll figure it out.

2217
02:40:44,488 --> 02:40:49,504
ZAC: We'll figure it out. Everybody, so thank you
guys so much. I don't really have anything more to

2218
02:40:49,504 --> 02:40:50,867
say other than thank you.

2219
02:40:50,867 --> 02:40:53,384
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Overlord, Overlord.

2220
02:40:53,384 --> 02:41:00,391
MATT: I don't think you guys truly, as an audience
understand exactly how much he's done to build

2221
02:41:00,391 --> 02:41:03,076
this channel, the blood, sweat, and tears. I mean,
both of them!

2222
02:41:03,076 --> 02:41:06,768
ZAC: Literally, not figuratively.

2223
02:41:06,768 --> 02:41:11,864
MATT: Zac has made us all feel so comfortable and
so excited to create this whole thing and has

2224
02:41:11,864 --> 02:41:16,188
given so much of himself and put so much of
himself into this and really, if you have the

2225
02:41:16,188 --> 02:41:20,243
opportunity on Twitter or wherever else to follow
him to his new job, let him know and feel the

2226
02:41:20,243 --> 02:41:24,328
appreciation. He's awesome and an amazing human
being and we're going to miss him terribly. But

2227
02:41:24,328 --> 02:41:26,303
we're so happy and excited for your new ventures.

2228
02:41:26,303 --> 02:41:27,201
ZAC: Yes!

2229
02:41:27,201 --> 02:41:31,219
(Overlord theme)

2230
02:41:31,219 --> 02:41:33,987
ZAC: I'm going to exit on that.

2231
02:41:33,987 --> 02:41:36,320
LAURA: Huzzah to Zac!

2232
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:41,239
ALL: Huzzah! Huzzah to Zac!

2233
02:41:41,239 --> 02:41:42,708
MATT: All righty.

2234
02:41:42,708 --> 02:41:47,313
LAURA: It's still going.

2235
02:41:47,313 --> 02:41:55,153
MATT: There we go. Cross straight over. That song
goes on for a while, too. There you go. All right,

2236
02:41:55,153 --> 02:42:01,409
so. One more quick little exit here for you guys
before we go on holiday break, we've had a special

2237
02:42:01,409 --> 02:42:07,625
guest, came in today to check out the stream. Big
fan of his work for a very long time and extremely

2238
02:42:07,625 --> 02:42:12,591
proud he came to watch the episode and he's been
live-tweeting throughout the evening, but he wants

2239
02:42:12,591 --> 02:42:16,853
to come in and give a little holiday hello as
well. We have to the cameras, come sit next to me in

2240
02:42:16,853 --> 02:42:19,550
this chair, the illustrious Chris Perkins.

2241
02:42:19,550 --> 02:42:23,294
(cheering)

2242
02:42:23,338 --> 02:42:25,983
MATT: It's everything I hoped it would be!

2243
02:42:25,983 --> 02:42:27,982
LIAM: He's made of dice!

2244
02:42:27,982 --> 02:42:29,803
CHRIS: What's on tap for next year?

2245
02:42:29,803 --> 02:42:33,548
MATT: Oh, you'll find out. It's all positive!

2246
02:42:33,548 --> 02:42:34,517
CHRIS: Oh, really?

2247
02:42:34,517 --> 02:42:35,695
MATT: No.

2248
02:42:35,695 --> 02:42:37,008
CHRIS: I have some suggestions.

2249
02:42:37,008 --> 02:42:37,897
MATT: Okay, we'll talk.

2250
02:42:37,897 --> 02:42:40,376
(laughter)

2251
02:42:40,376 --> 02:42:41,595
TRAVIS: Let us live!

2252
02:42:41,595 --> 02:42:42,866
LAURA: He's going to kill us all!

2253
02:42:42,866 --> 02:42:47,183
MARISHA: I will say, I feel like the DM power, the
balance--

2254
02:42:47,183 --> 02:42:48,540
LAURA: It's over 9000!

2255
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:49,735
MARISHA: It's over 9000!

2256
02:42:49,735 --> 02:42:51,051
TRAVIS: It's like if suns meet.

2257
02:42:51,051 --> 02:42:53,009
MATT: Terrible things happen behind this.

2258
02:42:53,009 --> 02:42:55,256
CHRIS: This is a real treat for me, thank you.
Thank you everybody.

2259
02:42:55,256 --> 02:42:57,108
MATT: Thanks for coming, sincerely.

2260
02:42:57,108 --> 02:42:58,426
CHRIS: No, this is magic.

2261
02:42:58,426 --> 02:42:59,992
MATT: Go ahead and roll this for a second. I'm
just curious.

2262
02:42:59,992 --> 02:43:01,431
CHRIS: Okay. Whoa.

2263
02:43:01,431 --> 02:43:11,265
MATT: Yeah, it's a fan-made die. All right, yeah.
It's a 15. Oh wait. It's like a Sputnik die. So he

2264
02:43:11,265 --> 02:43:16,589
rolled a 15. That's DM rolling right there. That's
upper teens, yo.

2265
02:43:16,589 --> 02:43:18,437
CHRIS: I rolled a 20.

2266
02:43:18,437 --> 02:43:26,035
MATT: Oh, there we go. See, there we go. Natural
20. Thank you so much for coming by, man.

2267
02:43:26,035 --> 02:43:26,934
Seriously.

2268
02:43:26,934 --> 02:43:33,625
CHRIS: I really appreciate it. It was great to
hang out. Watch the magic happen. My favorite

2269
02:43:33,625 --> 02:43:38,028
quote of the night was, "Don't be sad bear, be
happy bear."

2270
02:43:38,028 --> 02:43:41,463
(laughter)

2271
02:43:41,463 --> 02:43:44,718
CHRIS: I'm going to use that one. Take that one
back with me.

2272
02:43:44,718 --> 02:43:49,038
MATT: Go for it. So guys, next year, look forward
to the next Dungeons and Dragons module,

2273
02:43:49,038 --> 02:43:50,791
"Don't Be Sad Bear."

2274
02:43:50,791 --> 02:43:52,508
TRAVIS: Yes!

2275
02:43:52,508 --> 02:43:57,901
MATT: I think it's for levels three to seven.
It'll be really great. For those who aren't

2276
02:43:57,901 --> 02:44:04,078
familiar with Chris, he's been a longtime dungeon
master inspiration for a lot of us out there,

2277
02:44:04,078 --> 02:44:10,139
who's put up a blog for a long time with a lot of
great tips and tricks and discussions on what

2278
02:44:10,139 --> 02:44:14,705
makes a great story, what makes running a great
game. If you aren't following him right now, you

2279
02:44:14,705 --> 02:44:16,902
should, on Twitter at--

2280
02:44:16,902 --> 02:44:18,516
CHRIS: I don't know.

2281
02:44:18,516 --> 02:44:20,228
TRAVIS: Oh no!

2282
02:44:20,228 --> 02:44:21,697
CHRIS: @ChrisPerkinsDnD.

2283
02:44:21,697 --> 02:44:26,662
MATT: There you go. So, that should work out well.
Thank you so much for coming.

2284
02:44:26,662 --> 02:44:27,614
CHRIS: Thank you.

2285
02:44:27,614 --> 02:44:31,426
MATT: I appreciate that. And guys, happy holidays
and happy New Year. We'll see you--

2286
02:44:31,426 --> 02:44:38,247
ZAC: I forgot, I have one more quick announcement.
I can't believe I forgot this. So, I was talking

2287
02:44:38,247 --> 02:44:43,569
to the mods about it and some other people, maybe
I told them. So I'm going to challenge you guys in

2288
02:44:43,569 --> 02:44:50,354
the chat, my one last final challenge to you all.
I am going to get a tattoo to commemorate my year

2289
02:44:50,354 --> 02:44:57,236
at Geek and Sundry here. And I would like that to
be of you guys's design. So I'm going to challenge

2290
02:44:57,236 --> 02:45:04,541
you guys on the internet to tag me and a week from
today, I will Periscope me getting a tattoo that

2291
02:45:04,541 --> 02:45:08,388
someone in the chat room designed. Most likely a
Snugglelord; it'd be cool if it was a

2292
02:45:08,388 --> 02:45:09,751
Snugglelord.

2293
02:45:09,751 --> 02:45:12,788
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure I'm going to draw you a
cock and balls.

2294
02:45:12,788 --> 02:45:17,827
ZAC: Travis wants me to tattoo a cock and balls.
So, as long as it can be a cock and balls with

2295
02:45:17,827 --> 02:45:18,847
Travis's face.

2296
02:45:18,847 --> 02:45:21,115
MATT: I'll vote for that.

2297
02:45:21,115 --> 02:45:23,397
TRAVIS: A big veiny triumphant bastard.

2298
02:45:23,397 --> 02:45:27,699
MARISHA: How about Snugglelord riding Travis's
cock and balls?

2299
02:45:27,699 --> 02:45:34,459
ZAC: You've been challenged. You've been
challenged. But I definitely want to do that to

2300
02:45:34,459 --> 02:45:41,566
always have with me a little memory from this last
year. I really honestly can't tell you guys how

2301
02:45:41,566 --> 02:45:46,748
much this year meant to me and I want to make sure
that I will never forget, even if my brain starts

2302
02:45:46,748 --> 02:45:48,829
to fall away. I'll be like, oh look, Travis's--

2303
02:45:48,829 --> 02:45:50,740
LAURA and MARISHA: Cock and balls.

2304
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:52,194
TRAVIS: He was so good at Halo.

2305
02:45:52,194 --> 02:45:53,241
MATT: Yeah.

2306
02:45:53,241 --> 02:45:55,442
(laughter)

2307
02:45:55,442 --> 02:46:00,762
MATT: Well, nothing could possibly go wrong with
that. So go ahead and get your designs together,

2308
02:46:00,762 --> 02:46:06,302
submit those and see if you could be responsible
for designing a permanent piece of illustrious

2309
02:46:06,302 --> 02:46:12,195
Overlord's body. Wow. I'm excited for that now.

2310
02:46:12,195 --> 02:46:14,068
TRAVIS: Let's let the gates open.

2311
02:46:14,068 --> 02:46:16,436
MATT: Exactly. You guys, happy holidays.

2312
02:46:16,436 --> 02:46:19,789
MARISHA: One more announcement. Sorry, I lied, one
more.

2313
02:46:19,789 --> 02:46:22,910
MATT: This is like Lord of the Rings. This is
Return of the King. It's got seven endings.

2314
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:29,422
MARISHA: Yeah, well, it's going to be a double
feature. There will be a finale to the comic strip

2315
02:46:29,422 --> 02:46:34,661
of the Winter's Crest festival, so keep checking
the Geek and Sundry website because I believe it's

2316
02:46:34,661 --> 02:46:39,450
going to go up on Christmas Eve, actually. So
yeah, check it out.

2317
02:46:39,450 --> 02:46:40,505
MATT: Fantastic.

2318
02:46:40,505 --> 02:46:41,736
MARISHA: Still more stuff.

2319
02:46:41,736 --> 02:46:43,167
MATT: All right. Anyone else?

2320
02:46:43,167 --> 02:46:46,951
LAURA: Is there going to be a Critical Role
marathon or something coming up soon?

2321
02:46:46,951 --> 02:46:50,103
MATT: Are you guys playing Critical Role over the
holidays?

2322
02:46:50,103 --> 02:46:52,600
LUCAS: At some point.

2323
02:46:52,600 --> 02:46:54,127
MATT: At some point, there'll be a marathon.

2324
02:46:54,127 --> 02:46:55,797
TALIESIN: What a perfect time to get your friends
hooked.

2325
02:46:55,797 --> 02:46:58,480
MATT: There you go, it'll be on the Twitter.

2326
02:46:58,480 --> 02:47:00,329
ZAC: Lucas will let you know when it's up.

2327
02:47:00,329 --> 02:47:01,746
MATT: Lucas will let you know.

2328
02:47:01,746 --> 02:47:03,541
MARISHA: There is a bajillion hours' worth.

2329
02:47:03,541 --> 02:47:08,489
LUCAS: So, the plan is, the mods will be creating
a Twitch playlist, so it won't show up as us being

2330
02:47:08,489 --> 02:47:13,359
online. It will say we're offline, but you can
come to our actual Twitch page and there will be

2331
02:47:13,359 --> 02:47:18,748
marathons of each show individually. Critical Role
will be later on. It's not going to be the first

2332
02:47:18,748 --> 02:47:24,120
one that we marathon and that will be for probably
a week and a half until I get into the studio and

2333
02:47:24,120 --> 02:47:31,976
make actual playlists and you'll get that e-mail
that says-- probably not Critical Role, but just

2334
02:47:31,976 --> 02:47:38,446
an entire streaming marathon-- I don't even know.
I'll figure it out. I've got a week and a half to

2335
02:47:38,446 --> 02:47:42,829
figure it out, but there will be a playlist coming
right up. Next Monday.

2336
02:47:42,829 --> 02:47:45,154
LAURA: All right! Good announcement! Good job!

2337
02:47:45,154 --> 02:47:48,006
(cheering)

2338
02:47:48,006 --> 02:47:49,722
TALIESIN: Hail the new king!

2339
02:47:49,722 --> 02:47:51,592
ZAC: First announcement!

2340
02:47:51,592 --> 02:47:53,161
MATT: They grow up so fast!

2341
02:47:53,161 --> 02:47:57,846
(air horn sounds, laughter)

2342
02:47:57,846 --> 02:48:01,629
MATT: Awesome. Well, I guess then we'll relinquish
you guys to watch your Star Wars.

2343
02:48:01,667 --> 02:48:02,979
TRAVIS: Oh, actually--

2344
02:48:02,979 --> 02:48:11,209
MATT: (frustrated growl) I will smash your mini. I
would never do that. I painted it. Far too long.

2345
02:48:11,209 --> 02:48:14,681
All right, guys. Seriously, happy holidays, happy
new year.

2346
02:48:14,681 --> 02:48:15,949
LAURA: Happy holidays.

2347
02:48:15,949 --> 02:48:18,263
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Happy Winter's Crest.

2348
02:48:18,263 --> 02:48:20,134
MATT: Indeed. Bye guys.

2349
02:48:20,134 --> 02:48:21,403
LIAM: I have a snake!

2350
02:48:21,403 --> 02:48:24,359
TRAVIS: See you on the other side.
