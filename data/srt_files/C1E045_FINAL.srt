1
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:04,275
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,275 --> 00:00:08,463
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Hate you, Liam.

3
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:10,154
(laughter)

4
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:13,982
TRAVIS: That was good! Really nice. Some good
flavor on it.

5
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:22,024
MATT: You'll never know. So anyway! Welcome new
folks. People who aren't new folks, welcome back.

6
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:28,557
We have some announcements to get to real fast,
then we'll jump into the actual story proper here.

7
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:34,049
But, yeah! So, first and foremost, I wanted to
give a big thanks and shout-out to Syrinscape, I

8
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:39,623
mentioned them in last week's game, I put together
my gaming playlists on their platform, and I'm

9
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,313
going to be trying them out tonight to make sure
everything works out cool, but their setup is

10
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:46,228
fantastic and I'm really excited about being able
to overlap audio, and things fade in and out. If

11
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:49,880
you haven't checked it out, and you want to
really amp up your tabletop gaming, it's

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,485
phenomenal. But they're not paying for this, I'm
really excited about it. So that's that,

13
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:59,471
Syrinscape's awesome. Marisha, you want to talk
about Signal Boost?

14
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:01,355
MARISHA: Yeah! The first epil-- episode.

15
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:02,411
LAURA: Epilsode!

16
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:03,580
MARISHA: The first epil, of--

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,424
TALIESIN: Epilay!

18
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:09,789
MARISHA: Epil, epilay, epilogue. The first episode
of Signal Boost went live on Tuesday. Go check it

19
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:16,100
out on GeekandSundry.com. Go watch it, it's good
fun. And you should go watch it so we don't get

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,254
cancelled, and we'll keep making more episodes.

21
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:19,443
LIAM: Is that how it works?

22
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:20,412
MARISHA: Apparently!

23
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:22,068
MATT: Yeah, it's the weirdest thing.

24
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:23,098
MARISHA: It's crazy.

25
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:24,175
LAURA: They care about that?

26
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:27,479
MARISHA: Yeah. And I talk about Rat Queens, in it,
and--

27
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,512
LAURA: Yes! I saw! It's so good, Marisha. It's
really funny.

28
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:34,425
TALIESIN: It's like ten minutes of your-- you have
more minutes than two minutes, spend a couple of

29
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:35,401
minutes.

30
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:41,082
MARISHA: And I tell you about cool things that I
like. That I picked out myself. My favorite

31
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:42,415
things. Done.

32
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:48,346
MATT: Watch it. It's good. All right. Next thing I
wanted to announce for you guys, tonight's

33
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:54,039
donations, and all donations for the week, are
going to be going, as opposed to 826 overall, are

34
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:58,170
going to go to 826Seattle specifically, to
Fearless Ideas, is what it's called there, their

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,110
section up there, you can go to FearlessIdeas.org.
This past week there was a terrible gas explosion

36
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,583
in Seattle, you may have seen on the news, and it
did a lot of damage to that vicinity, including

37
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:13,058
Fearless Ideas, and they've had to cancel a bunch
of their stuff, and they're trying to get things

38
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:15,979
repaired and going. So all of our donations this
evening will be going towards them and helping

39
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:22,909
them get that effort taken care of. So think good
thoughts and help out if you can. Let's see.

40
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,242
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Love you, Seattle!

41
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:32,864
MATT: 826. We've, next Friday, in Anaheim, at
WonderCon, Friday night, we'll be doing a Critical

42
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:37,017
Role panel, from 7:00 to 8:00pm, in Room 515A.

43
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:39,194
LAURA: Wait, are we supposed to be at that?

44
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:44,828
MATT: Next Friday. Next Friday. But most of us
will be there for that panel. We'll be doing a

45
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:49,561
Q&amp;A, answering questions, talking about the show,
for all the folks that are local or coming to that

46
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:53,366
convention in the Anaheim area of southern
California. So, look forward to seeing you there,

47
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:54,781
next Friday.

48
00:02:54,781 --> 00:03:00,067
LAURA: Yes, that's when we-- I can't say. I'll
talk to you guys afterwards.

49
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:05,709
MATT: (laughs) Okay. We'll go over that. Mystery--
secret, I like it.

50
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,294
LAURA: Secret, secret.

51
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:10,565
MATT: Wanted to give another shout-out to Dwarven
Forge again, I mentioned them last week. You got

52
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,812
to get a glimpse of some of the map stuff they
gave us here at Critical Role to help improve our

53
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:20,395
battle mats and scenarios on occasion. Their new
Castle Builder Kickstarter is phenomenal, and if

54
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:25,285
you're looking to do big structures and cool
castle-based ramparts and parapets and everything,

55
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:27,478
go check it out, it might be right up your alley.

56
00:03:27,478 --> 00:03:28,782
TRAVIS: So pretty.

57
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:37,292
MATT: So pretty. It's so pretty. Also, Laura,
if you want to announce, we have some new merch up

58
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,504
in the store!

59
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:44,236
LAURA: Go check GeekandSundry.com, go to their
store, right now, because they're up, and it's so

60
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:48,449
awesome, and I can't wait for you guys to see, we
have a Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirt.

61
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,485
(cheering)

62
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:54,323
LAURA: And I've been so excited about this shirt
coming out, I can't wait to wear it, why aren't we

63
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:55,894
wearing it right now?

64
00:03:55,894 --> 00:04:00,116
MATT: (Gilmore voice) "Don't worry. Trust me, it's
a fabulous shirt. Some would even say it's quite

65
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,259
"glorious."

66
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:03,130
TRAVIS: Oh my god, oh my god.

67
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,407
LAURA: As well as the Gilmore's Glorious Goods
t-shirts, we also have exclusive Critical Role d20

68
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:12,797
rings, spinny rings. Those are limited, so if you
get them, then snag them fast, because they're

69
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:13,952
going to be gone.

70
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,410
TRAVIS: We get one of those before they disappear,
right?

71
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,272
LAURA: I think they said they were going to set us
aside some, they'd better.

72
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:22,613
TRAVIS: They are. They're bitchin'. You spin it,
the 20 is the Critical Role logo.

73
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:26,797
LAURA: Why don't we have them right now?! At
intermission, maybe we can grab them at

74
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,082
intermission.

75
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,799
TRAVIS: They're sick.

76
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:35,656
MATT: For those who don't know what those are,
the d20 spin rings, or spin rings in general,

77
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:39,060
they're actually two separate moving pieces with
ball bearings on the inside, and you have all

78
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,158
numbers one through 20 on the actual ring, and you
can spin it with your finger, and it acts like a

79
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,199
die roll!

80
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,684
LAURA: And the d20, when you crit succeed, it's a
Critical Role logo. Just putting that out there.

81
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:51,633
TRAVIS: You can do all your life decisions based
off a ring.

82
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,018
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

83
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,347
LIAM: You still can die from them, though, just to
be clear.

84
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:56,563
TALIESIN: Roll a one.

85
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,141
MARISHA: And we are not held responsible if that
happens.

86
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,974
TRAVIS: You go straight to Craven Edge.

87
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:06,026
LIAM: It's appropriately called a "die."

88
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:07,306
LAURA: Whatever.

89
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:12,558
MATT: Liam!

90
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:13,676
LIAM: Yeah?

91
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:15,076
MATT: You wanted to--

92
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:18,198
LIAM: Sure, I could talk about a couple of things.
Hey, a quick shout-out for our neighbor, Ivan van

93
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:23,487
Norman's Kickstarter, The ABCs of RPGs, has three
days left. I backed it immediately, because I like

94
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:28,017
D&amp;D and I have kids, and you put those two things
together and good things happen. So that's good,

95
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:33,646
three days left. Also, hey, if you like to put
your dice in boxes, I tell you what. Wyrmwood

96
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:40,699
Gaming make beautiful boxes, and if you go over to
their site and you use the code critrole.

97
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,974
ALL: Crit. Role.

98
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:46,987
LIAM: There it is. You get free shipping, they're
beautiful, they have all different kinds of woods

99
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:56,673
to put your dice inside. Is there anything else?
Oh, yeah! Oh, okay. Yeah, hey, some of us, not all

100
00:05:56,673 --> 00:06:03,580
of us, are going to be going up to San Fran later
this month to make appearances on GameSpot's show

101
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:10,727
The Lobby for a couple of segments, and then, also
then hopping over to hang with the guys at Kinda

102
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:13,261
Funny to play D&amp;D.

103
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:15,262
LAURA: Those guys are stupid.

104
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:19,066
MATT: Which, a few of us will be running a quick
little one-shot game I'll be running with the aid

105
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:26,703
of one of their local gentlemen. And it
should be a ridiculously ridiculous time! And

106
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:27,780
it'll be a lot of fun.

107
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,227
LIAM: And I'm curious to see, because there's
going to be two DMs, in sort of a Batman and

108
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:32,210
Robin-type relationship kind of thing?

109
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,161
MATT: Oh yeah. We got plans. I've co-DM'd
before, it can be very interesting. And very

110
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:37,678
chaotic. I'm excited.

111
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,494
TRAVIS: Going to kill everybody.

112
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:40,658
MATT: Probably.

113
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:47,117
LAURA: This has nothing to do with announcements,
but I want to only roll green dice tonight. For

114
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,601
Saint Patrick's Day.

115
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:52,433
MARISHA: That's a good idea, I've got a set of
green dice. I'll get them out. Sure.

116
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:55,318
TRAVIS: That's stupid. I have gray-ass dice and a
blue one.

117
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:56,930
MARISHA: Got to get them all out.

118
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,573
MATT: This is technically light green, guys, by
the way, just so you're aware. Cool. Just making

119
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,406
sure we're all cool on that.

120
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:04,224
TRAVIS: Plus the underwear you're wearing.

121
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,972
MATT: Shh, that's just for you.

122
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:09,444
LIAM: Travis and I are wearing green snake shirts,
because (Irish accent) Saint Patrick drove the

123
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:13,152
snakes out of Ireland, into Burbank.

124
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:15,669
MATT: Drove the Slytherin from Ireland. He got rid
of them all.

125
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,636
TRAVIS: Yeah. I took the Floo network.

126
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,954
MARISHA: And I got this in Ireland, so it counts.

127
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:21,628
LAURA: It kind of counts, Marisha.

128
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:22,942
MARISHA: It counts.

129
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,853
LIAM: (Irish accent) It's fucking Irish wool!

130
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:26,306
MARISHA: And this is green.

131
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:28,665
TRAVIS: Yeah, made from real Irish cats.

132
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:34,815
MATT: They are the best, aren't they? Last but not
least, unless anyone else has any other

133
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:36,900
announcements to make, anything else?

134
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:45,254
TALIESIN: Oh! I got a quick one, Book of Murder
came out today, so you can hear me do a very weird

135
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:49,227
accent, it's great. So. Yes. Very weird accent.

136
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:55,948
MATT: And last, next week, we'll have a special
guest joining us for an episode, a new guest, the

137
00:07:55,948 --> 00:08:00,514
intrepid Nerdist himself, Chris Hardwick, will be
coming in for a game next week.

138
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,616
(cheering)

139
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:08,889
MATT: Oh, I'm excited! We made his character this
past Monday, and it should be a lot of fun. He's

140
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,186
actually fun to game with. We've played D&amp;D a
couple times, and he'll be a good addition to the

141
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,731
team for his brief stop by. So next week, come
check him out on our show!

142
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:18,336
TRAVIS: Uh-oh, what does that mean?

143
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:20,721
MATT: So thanks for coming, Chris. I don't know,
it'll be fun.

144
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,559
TALIESIN: Cleric, is what it means.

145
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:25,490
MATT: Hoping every guest is a cleric. Just in
case.

146
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,378
TRAVIS: Save us! From ourselves.

147
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:33,831
MATT: All right, then. Without further ado, unless
you guys have anything else, we'll go ahead and

148
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:37,940
hop into a quick synopsis of where we are in
Critical Role.

149
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,276
LIAM: Shit. Help. Help. Help. Help.

150
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:43,138
MATT: Sam will be here shortly, guys, don't freak
out. He's dealing with children and traffic.

151
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:44,871
TALIESIN: Not at the same time.

152
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:48,144
MARISHA: Damn it, you beat me to it. I was going
to say those two aren't mutually exclusive.

153
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,902
Children and traffic.

154
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:57,417
MATT: So. Where we left off. The party of Vox
Machina, having to deal with the current terrible

155
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:02,519
danger of the Chroma Conclave, a collection of
very dangerous dragons that have torn through the

156
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,277
entire Tal'Dorei countryside, have then gone on
this quest to collect allies, and find these items

157
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:13,747
called the Vestiges of Divergence, these artifacts
of ancient wars that carry great power and seem to

158
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:17,519
be the best way you could prepare yourselves for
going up against these terrifyingly powerful

159
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,638
entities. In searching for this, you went and made
your way to Vasselheim, where you reacquired and

160
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:29,336
reestablished friendships with Zahra and Kashaw,
two allies from previous instalments of our

161
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:36,816
wondrous adventure, as well as getting Lady Kima
on loan from the Platinum Sanctuary of Bahamut,

162
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:41,338
and you all went to seek the first bit of
information you discovered about one of these

163
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:48,741
vestiges, not too far from Vasselheim. The
champion of the Raven Queen's armor that had been

164
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:53,531
entombed within this temple that had sunken
beneath a lake. After traveling to this lake,

165
00:09:53,531 --> 00:10:00,019
finding your way through this subterranean, watery
location, you found the location of the tomb, upon

166
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:07,077
which, a series of fish creatures, called kuo-toa,
had seemingly been worshiping another denizen of

167
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:14,119
this temple, a rather strange slime-covered
beholder, that then surprised the party. The

168
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:21,714
battle hard-fought, you came out victorious, and
upon going to retrieve your spoils, a trap was set

169
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:30,757
off in the tomb, dodged by one, survived by a
bear, and claimed the life of our beloved

170
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:38,491
Vex'ahlia. After a resurrection ritual attempted
by Kashaw, the party helping, they were successful

171
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:44,717
in bringing her soul back from the other side,
restoring her to life, and the party then,

172
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:50,454
figuring out what their next step in their journey
was, took their new allies, via Keyleth's

173
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:54,915
Teleportation via Plants spell, back to
Whitestone, which seems to be building as this

174
00:10:54,915 --> 00:11:02,405
defensive bastion, this currently not on the radar
of the Conclave location that needs defenses, and

175
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:07,279
a good place to keep your allies at the time. And
that was where we left off, as you guys had just

176
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,296
stepped back into Whitestone.

177
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:12,185
LAURA: We haven't actually slept yet, then.

178
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:13,739
MATT: Nope!

179
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,100
LAURA: It's late.

180
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,792
MARISHA: What time is it here?

181
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:26,043
MATT: I'd say through the evening's travels--
Well, you guys slept all night the night before

182
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:28,269
you went to the temple, the temple's probably
been--

183
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,928
MARISHA: That's true, we did sleep, actually, we
camped out.

184
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:32,782
LAURA: We did?

185
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:36,003
MARISHA: Remember? You talked to Zahra, and I
talked to Kash? Then we slept.

186
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:37,761
MATT: Yeah, you guys did camp out.

187
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:41,532
LAURA: Oh. I didn't know if we camped, I thought
we talked.

188
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:42,870
MATT: You talked.

189
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,826
MARISHA: We at least chilled. I don't know.

190
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:46,733
MATT: Regardless.
You found your way to Whitestone.

191
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:53,431
We'll say for the sake of the current setting,
you've come in in a rather overcast mid-afternoon

192
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:59,286
in Whitestone, you may have spent some time there
gathering yourselves as your allies scope out

193
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:04,291
their new surroundings, the people of Whitestone
accepting you as you arrive, you can always see

194
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:09,839
people walking by and catching a glance at the
group of heroes known as Vox Machina that helped

195
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,685
liberate them from the oppressive Briarwoods not
long ago.

196
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,308
TALIESIN: Keep crawling out of trees.

197
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:18,523
MARISHA: It's always weird. Not crawling out of
trees, that people like us.

198
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:23,728
TRAVIS: Should we inspect our spoils?

199
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:29,254
TALIESIN: I was going to say, we should take the
armor and the necklace to the castle and have it

200
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:30,967
inspected.

201
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,724
LAURA: Is Lady Allura here?

202
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,328
MATT: Kima, who is with you, is like, "Is she?"

203
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:44,011
LAURA: No. Well, she was on her way to Westruun,
and we haven't heard from her yet.

204
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:45,241
TALIESIN: No.

205
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:49,637
MATT: "Haven't heard from her since-- You say
Westruun was under attack as well?"

206
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,783
LAURA: Yes, but she knew it. She was going in
secret.

207
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:58,020
MATT: "That prideful woman." She slings her hammer
off her shoulder and slams it to the ground and

208
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,220
says, "Well. If she doesn't arrive in the next few
hours, I'm going to gather a party and we're going

209
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,128
"to go to Westruun and find her."

210
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,165
TRAVIS: Yeah!

211
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,863
MARISHA: Kima-- Wait, what? Why?

212
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:12,381
LAURA: Wait, there's a dragon there, Kima, a very
large one, and she was being very, very

213
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:13,687
stealthy--

214
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:18,999
MATT: Her hammer slams into her metallic armor, and
she goes, "I've a much bigger dragon backing me up."

215
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:21,343
And she looks up to the sky for a second and
grins.

216
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,725
TRAVIS: Lady Kima don't give a fuck.

217
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:27,142
LAURA: We'll wait, Kima.

218
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:29,723
MATT: (frustrated sigh)

219
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:32,989
LAURA: Going in loud will only cause more
trouble.

220
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:36,917
MATT: "I'll wait a few days."

221
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:40,039
LAURA: She should be here by then.

222
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,870
MARISHA: I can always attempt to scry, and see if
I can check in on her.

223
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,512
MATT: "Okay. Not a bad idea."

224
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:48,771
MARISHA: Okay.

225
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:51,073
MATT: "Okay. I need a drink."

226
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:53,569
MARISHA: Let's get somewhere safe.

227
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,770
MATT: She charges off, looking for the nearest
tavern.

228
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:02,350
MARISHA: Here, I guess. I don't know. I forget
it's not overrun by vampires, I'm sorry. Sorry, I

229
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,585
forgot; it's all right now.

230
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:05,697
LAURA: Maybe somewhere safe, like right here--

231
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:08,457
MARISHA: Like right here, sorry, there's a lot
going on.

232
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:13,978
MATT: Zahra and Kashaw looking around expectantly
as you continue this conversation. Kash crosses

233
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:23,574
his arms, goes, "Great place. There's a lot of
white." Of which Zahra comes and steps over and is

234
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:28,774
like, "Don't worry, darling. (laughter) So,
sleeping arrangements, I hope?"

235
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,142
LAURA: Yes, the castle.

236
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:32,979
TALIESIN: We'll be putting you up in the castle.

237
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:36,012
MATT: "That's what I like to hear. All right. To
the castle, Kash?"

238
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:42,439
"Sure. It's better than, well,
it's better than anything.

239
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:45,303
"Let's go for the
castle." And they both make their way towards

240
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:50,183
Whitestone Castle, to find a comfortable place to
get themselves situated in their new

241
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:51,871
surroundings.

242
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:58,499
LAURA: So we're healed up, we are healed, we are
not running the risk of dying at any moment,

243
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,349
because we've been healed.

244
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:02,578
MATT: What is that? What is that blur of green?

245
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:04,237
TRAVIS: It's a fucking leprechaun, get it!

246
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,806
SAM: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

247
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,439
LIAM: You should be.

248
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,322
MARISHA: Your shirt, is that new? Because I love
it so much.

249
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:13,303
SAM: Thanks! But I'm also wearing a tie because
it's a special night.

250
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,942
LAURA: Right. It's a special occasion.

251
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:18,037
SAM: (sighs) So, is Allura dead?

252
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:21,162
(laughter)

253
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,881
TRAVIS: Kima just left, so--

254
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:27,433
LAURA: She's on her way to a tavern. Kima's
drinking it up. Grog! Kima's drinking it up.

255
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,210
MARISHA: Are we heading to a tavern?

256
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,422
TALIESIN: We're heading to the castle. We're going
to talk to friends, we're going to take a look at--

257
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,027
TRAVIS: Corpse armor, hello.

258
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:35,429
MARISHA: Oh, corpse armor.

259
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:38,507
TRAVIS: Yeah. You know, the thing that almost
killed our friend over here?

260
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:40,676
LAURA: It did kill me. According to you.

261
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,004
TALIESIN: It-- yes.

262
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:48,577
TRAVIS: Yeah, but, I mean, you're here, so you
didn't die. But you did. But you didn't. But you

263
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:50,930
did. And then you didn't.

264
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,999
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

265
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:52,997
TRAVIS: Yep.

266
00:15:52,997 --> 00:15:58,337
MATT: All right, so. You guys all heading to the
castle?

267
00:15:58,337 --> 00:15:59,446
TALIESIN: Yes.

268
00:15:59,446 --> 00:16:04,612
MATT: You head to the castle. Cassandra isn't there
at the moment, but Keeper Yennen is currently

269
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:11,626
there with a few other members of the makeshift
council you guys put together towards the end. One

270
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:14,532
of the heads of the entire farming establishment
here in Whitestone is with them, and they're

271
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:21,063
having a conversation. As Zahra and Kashaw burst
in first, he's like, "I'm sorry, we're not

272
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:27,462
"currently taking visitors, could you-- Oh. Friends
of yours, I presume?"

273
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:28,729
TALIESIN: Good friends.

274
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:33,266
LAURA: Helpers, actually. They're going to be here
for a while. Hopefully.

275
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:41,617
MATT: "Gracious. Oh, I see you yourself carry the
vestments of a man of the cloth. Who brings your

276
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,051
"power this day?"

277
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:47,986
Kashaw gives him a look and goes, "You don't even
want to know, buddy." Walks past him.

278
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:49,784
TALIESIN: That was a really good Kashaw.

279
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:53,192
MATT: "Very well! I assume they're staying here as
well."

280
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:56,362
TALIESIN: Yes. We appreciate it greatly.

281
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,648
MATT: "They'll be taken care of, Percival."

282
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:06,528
TALIESIN: They will be well worth your time. We
also have something that needs a bit of study. We

283
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:11,660
found something. We found two objects of power
that we think may help us turn the table against

284
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,927
the dragons.

285
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:13,980
LAURA: Two objects?

286
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,004
MATT: "This is good news."

287
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:15,789
TALIESIN: Two objects.

288
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:16,713
LAURA: What was the second?

289
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:17,680
TALIESIN: There was a necklace.

290
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,565
LAURA: There was?

291
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:19,320
TALIESIN: There was.

292
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,202
SAM: You were dead.

293
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:22,705
LAURA: Oh. I must have missed it because I was
dead. That's right.

294
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:23,818
MATT: "Dead?!"

295
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,654
TALIESIN: It's been a very long day.

296
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:26,939
SAM: Mostly dead.

297
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,865
MARISHA: Be very careful when handling this armor,
is what we're trying to say.

298
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:32,814
TRAVIS: Or don't handle it, and we'll take care of
it.

299
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:34,571
MATT: "So, the armor is what killed you?"

300
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,784
LAURA: No, actually, a trap that Percival set off
is what killed me.

301
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,559
TALIESIN: Yes, the--

302
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,578
LIAM: What?

303
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:48,355
TALIESIN: -- trap was a bit-- it was a bit, ah--
there was a trap. And it was well-protected.

304
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:50,881
LIAM: What?

305
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:52,866
LAURA: What, what, what? What?

306
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:53,941
TALIESIN: Yes, what.

307
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:54,792
LAURA: What?

308
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,392
TRAVIS: (mutters) He didn't know that.

309
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:58,251
LAURA: What? So these Vestiges.

310
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,043
MATT: "Vestiges."

311
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:03,267
LAURA: These leathers, these things.

312
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:10,557
MATT: "Um--" And he puts a couple of small,
armored, like, studded-leather gloves on and has

313
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:17,378
to carefully reach out for the vestments as you
hand them. And he grabs them. "Give me a bit of

314
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:24,795
"time with them, perhaps, I need to clarify what
this enchantment may be. Do you mind staying

315
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:26,314
"around, just in case?"

316
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,705
TALIESIN: Not at all.

317
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:32,817
MATT: "Don't feel strange that I don't trust this,
but, based on your history with it, I would like a

318
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:39,524
"little backup." So, he carries you off down the
far hallway, you didn't get this far into

319
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:44,104
Whitestone when you initially came through, but
towards the back there was a small study area

320
00:18:44,104 --> 00:18:49,667
converted into a research establishment largely
set up for the ziggurat beneath the city. He

321
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:54,617
clears off an area of the table and sets this
down. And he takes some time working with the

322
00:18:54,617 --> 00:19:01,694
vestments before he eventually, and it's this
awkward quiet of hearing him mutter to himself and

323
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:08,217
bring out a symbol and bring over a minor
enchantment to reveal information, that tearing

324
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:17,019
into the divinity, the divine magic that is
granted to him, before he says, "This carries the

325
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:27,677
"mark of the Raven Queen, a very strong mark. I've
not seen power like this in but an object."

326
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:32,243
LAURA: It was worn by one of her champions. The
great Purvan.

327
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:34,938
MATT: "That's a strange name."

328
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:35,975
LAURA: Yeah.

329
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:46,863
MATT: "Regardless, it appears that this armor does
help fortify one's defenses from any sort of

330
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:54,272
"physical damage, as well as give you a chance of
surviving even the most dangerous of near-death

331
00:19:54,272 --> 00:20:07,616
"experiences. It also grants a fluid resistance to
the elements. Here."

332
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:11,417
And he hands it over, and-- who would like to take
this? Item card to--

333
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,105
TRAVIS: Well, you died for it, you--

334
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:15,352
LAURA: I think I like it, but I'll just look at
it.

335
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:16,389
MARISHA: It's leather?

336
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:17,381
LAURA: It's leather.

337
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:22,297
MATT: So, to give you the specifics on it, it's
plus two to AC. Magical on top of the studded

338
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:27,849
leather armor. Plus two enchantment, beyond just
the studded leather armor. It does give you

339
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:30,446
advantage on death saving throws.

340
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:31,833
SAM: You'll need that.

341
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:38,852
MATT: As it is called the Deathwalker's Ward, and
once per short rest, you can set it to be

342
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:42,813
resistant to one of the five types of damage.

343
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:44,263
LAURA: You choose which one.

344
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:47,044
MATT: You choose. You can change it. You can leave
it all on one, but if you want to change it during

345
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:50,815
a short rest, you can shift it from fire or cold,
or lightning--

346
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,509
TRAVIS: Acid, or necrotic.

347
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,390
SAM: You're, like, indestructible now!

348
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,700
MARISHA: Do you have fancy leather armor right
now? What does your armor do right now? Anything?

349
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,390
LIAM: It's acid-resistant.

350
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:08,466
LAURA: My armor's acid-resistant, I sort of stole
it from my brother. Do you want your

351
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,999
acid-resistant armor back, then?

352
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,009
LIAM: Whatever you want, Vex'ahlia.

353
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,940
LAURA: He's in such a sour mood lately.

354
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:27,061
TRAVIS: Well, yeah. Well, what about the
necklace?

355
00:21:27,061 --> 00:21:30,750
MATT: "The necklace as well?"

356
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,407
TALIESIN: I hand it over.

357
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:39,737
MATT: He takes it, and he goes, "Well, the chain
on this necklace is not actually part of the

358
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:44,123
"enchantment, it's merely to hold the crystal
itself. The crystal is the item of particular

359
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:49,769
"interest here, this-- oh, wait a minute." He takes
it and he scans over the table and pulls up a

360
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:55,832
jeweler's eyepiece and inspects it closely.
"There's something inside this gem."

361
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:56,889
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

362
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,536
MARISHA: (groans) Not again.

363
00:21:58,536 --> 00:21:59,620
LAURA: What is it?

364
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,691
MARISHA: Why do things like living in gems? It
can't be comfortable.

365
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:05,002
TRAVIS: It might be a worm.

366
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:07,146
LAURA: It's like tequila.

367
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:12,087
MATT: "I can't actually ascertain the nature of
whatever being is encased within this, but--"

368
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,655
LAURA: There's a being, it's a being?

369
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:14,800
MARISHA: Encased.

370
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,091
LAURA: Is it a soul gem?

371
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:18,551
MARISHA: Like something put it in there.

372
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:22,824
MATT: He takes a moment and concentrates on his
holy symbol of Pelor, and you can see as he puts

373
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:32,804
aside the eyepiece, his eyes glaze over with a
grayish, frosted white color, at which point he

374
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:37,609
inspects the gem very closely, and there's this
slight vibration in the air around him. As soon as

375
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:42,891
it fades about a minute later, he pulls back and
goes, "This is referred to as the Raven's Slumber.

376
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:48,566
"It's actually a small gateway to a tiny
pocket-plane."

377
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,724
SAM: A pocket-plane?

378
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:51,824
MARISHA: Ooh.

379
00:22:51,824 --> 00:23:00,990
MATT: "It can contain one creature. You have to
contact whatever it was, and it can't be too big,

380
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,918
"but it can essentially contain something
indefinitely within this."

381
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,514
LAURA: But something's already in there?

382
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:09,079
MATT: "Something is already in this."

383
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,267
TRAVIS: Awesome.

384
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,250
SAM: Something that we can summon?

385
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,765
MARISHA: Any way we can find out what it possibly
is before we summon it?

386
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:19,577
MATT: "Unfortunately, I do not have that
capability."

387
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,262
LAURA: It was buried with--

388
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:22,491
SAM: I'll take that.

389
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:25,367
LAURA: Oh, that's really smart to give to
Scanlan.

390
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:28,601
TRAVIS: Well, like, you said "not too big" though,
right?

391
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:34,140
MATT: "The confines of the space, at least, as
part of the enchantment, seem rather small. A bit

392
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,802
"larger than you, maybe, but not much more than
that."

393
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:38,355
TRAVIS: Right, right, okay.

394
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:40,806
MATT: "Here."

395
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:41,879
TRAVIS: Please.

396
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,955
MARISHA: Well, does it change size?

397
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,296
LAURA: This is maybe the worst thing that
Scanlan's ever held outside of that gun that you

398
00:23:47,296 --> 00:23:48,171
had, Percy.

399
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:51,941
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? Can we take it
in the woods, open it up, and if it sucks we kill

400
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:53,790
it, and if not, we've got a new pet.

401
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,051
MARISHA: We don't even know how to open it up! Do
we know how to open it up?

402
00:23:57,051 --> 00:23:58,318
TRAVIS: Oh, we will find a way.

403
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:03,040
LAURA: It was buried with the Raven Queen's
champion, I mean, it could be incredibly

404
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,162
dangerous. Or it could be incredibly good, and he
trapped it, and they're bad, right?

405
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:11,089
LIAM: The same could be said about your new
pajamas.

406
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:16,065
LAURA: They are so beautiful. I do like feathers.

407
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:17,985
TRAVIS: What do they smell like?

408
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:24,603
LAURA: (sniffs) Like (sniffs) must and mold. And
birds, really.

409
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:26,997
TRAVIS: (laughing) And birds? Eesh.

410
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:29,828
MATT: "So, is that all you require of me?"

411
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:35,234
TRAVIS: I require Percy to tell us what the fuck's
up with the necklace he's reading about.

412
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:37,270
TALIESIN: Just what he said.

413
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,005
LAURA: Yeah, he already told us about it.

414
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:44,283
SAM: Once we release whatever is inside of it, we
can use this necklace as a weapon, to--

415
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:45,315
TALIESIN: It's a cage.

416
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:46,659
SAM: To trap people.

417
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:52,003
MARISHA: Hang on, okay. Let's think about this.
What do we remember from the great Purvan's

418
00:24:52,003 --> 00:24:53,320
story?

419
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,924
LAURA: Well, let me look at my book?

420
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:56,189
MARISHA: What did he fight?

421
00:24:56,189 --> 00:25:02,309
SAM: I just remember that Purvan's story touched
me. Touched me in inappropriate ways.

422
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,403
TRAVIS: (laughing) No, no, no.

423
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:09,976
LAURA: You know what I like about this particular
piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so

424
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,806
it's extra special instead of the regular paper.

425
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:14,109
MATT: It's legendary.

426
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:15,749
TALIESIN: Legendary cardstock.

427
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:17,814
MARISHA: Can we get purple cardstock up in here?

428
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:24,421
LAURA: I'm talking to Matt, bitches. Okay. I
forgot what I was going to say-- Oh, my book! My

429
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:27,339
30-gold book! Does it say anything about what
Purvan fought?

430
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:31,440
MATT: All right! You read through. There were many,
many things throughout the war that were fought:

431
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,013
entities from the Nine Hells, there was a faction
of the Abyss that came in as a third bit of evil

432
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:42,382
in this whole conflict; and while not in alliance
against the other forces of chaos, there were many

433
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:48,155
forces of chaos lashing out at what was nearby. So
the Champion's-- there was no specific entity that

434
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:53,927
was his chosen, or at least, what you can
ascertain to be a specific being of hatred,

435
00:25:53,927 --> 00:26:01,468
although it does speak of Purvan, the Champion of
the Raven Queen, keeping with him an ally.

436
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:05,955
LAURA: Like Trinket.

437
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:18,939
MATT: It doesn't say the nature of the ally, it
just says the dangerous and respected Galdric.

438
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:21,117
LAURA: (gasps) Galdric.

439
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:23,052
TALIESIN: Well, there are some options here.

440
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:24,350
LAURA: What?

441
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,368
TALIESIN: No, that won't work, damn it.

442
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:27,955
TRAVIS: Well, say it, come on.

443
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:35,795
TALIESIN: Well, I was thinking we could find a
safe place, surround it, let it out, and if it's

444
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:40,102
dangerous, take care of it. We could even take it
down into the pits beneath the castle so that if

445
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:45,900
it's a magical creature, it would be harmless.
Except I don't know if we could actually release

446
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,193
it down there. I don't know--

447
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:48,895
LAURA: Yeah, what if it touches the thing, and
it--

448
00:26:48,895 --> 00:26:50,439
SAM: There's also magic resistance down there.

449
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:52,103
TALIESIN: Yeah, which means it wouldn't work in
the first place.

450
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:54,464
MARISHA: What if he's friendly? I mean, he talks
about being an ally.

451
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:55,638
TALIESIN: It might be an ally.

452
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:57,345
MARISHA: Well then, wouldn't we want to save it?

453
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:59,385
LAURA: An ally of Purvan! An ally of Purvan's!

454
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:00,425
TALIESIN: Yes.

455
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:01,817
LAURA: Is Purvan a good guy?

456
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:02,731
TALIESIN: Yes.

457
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:04,243
LAURA: I thought the Raven Queen was not good!

458
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:05,488
TALIESIN: No, the Raven Queen--

459
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:07,913
MARISHA: She's like-- neutral.

460
00:27:07,913 --> 00:27:09,665
TALIESIN: Can I make a roll for this?

461
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:10,909
MATT: Make a religion check.

462
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,261
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you. Nope, nope, it's St.
Patty's Day.

463
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:16,167
TRAVIS: Don't kill anybody.

464
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,763
LAURA: Yeah, with these green dice.

465
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:18,910
TALIESIN: Religion or history?

466
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,977
MATT and TRAVIS: Religion.

467
00:27:19,977 --> 00:27:23,692
TALIESIN: 11.

468
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:30,111
MATT: 11. The general essence of the Raven Queen:
she is both loved and feared in equal parts. She

469
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:35,087
does not lord over the afterlife, the underworld,
whatever you may call it-- she lords over the

470
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:40,582
moment and the transition of death, which is
largely considered neither a good nor evil, just a

471
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:47,075
natural force. It could be accepted either way.
Many men fear it, and fear her for that reason,

472
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:52,465
and there are those that instead embrace it as the
inevitable. As to the true nature of her intent,

473
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:55,134
no one really knows. It's part of her mystique.

474
00:27:55,134 --> 00:28:02,220
TRAVIS: So, like, even if we let out the glorious
Ball-lick or whatever his name is, like, if he's

475
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,241
bad, we can't really put him back in, right?

476
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:08,285
TALIESIN: No, we actually can. Actually, we can
put him back in.

477
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,688
TRAVIS: What, we touch him with it and he goes
back in?

478
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,771
SAM: Correct.

479
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:13,195
MATT: After a saving throw.

480
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:18,028
MARISHA: Maybe we should save him and release him
when he'll be valuable to us?

481
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:20,933
TALIESIN: So would a trap. We could also trap
other creatures--

482
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:25,665
LAURA: It's like a Poké Ball! Right? It's like a
Pokémon?

483
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:27,545
TALIESIN: Yes, it's exactly like a Poké Ball.

484
00:28:27,545 --> 00:28:29,826
MARISHA: Who knows if he'll go back in willingly?

485
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:31,483
TALIESIN: You don't have to go in willingly,
that's sort of the point.

486
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:33,423
MATT: I guess you could technically use it that way,
yeah.

487
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:39,441
MARISHA: But wouldn't we rather be friendly with
him than him be angry at us the next time we

488
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:40,711
release him?

489
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:43,488
TALIESIN: I'm more excited about the idea of
carrying around an empty trap.

490
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:52,393
MARISHA: But we could win both. But we could have
a trap and a friend.

491
00:28:52,393 --> 00:28:56,484
LIAM: I think Percy is right that we should let it
out now because it's a question mark, no matter

492
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:02,974
what. Whatever, it's all theories. We don't know
what we're getting into, and better that it pop

493
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:07,114
out now, on its own, and not while we're facing a
fucking beholder.

494
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:09,213
LAURA: I think we should do it in the forest
outside of Vasselheim.

495
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:11,297
TALIESIN: Or the forest outside of Whitestone.

496
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:12,862
SAM: Vasselheim? We're here.

497
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:17,099
MARISHA: Why don't we try and do a little bit more
research on Galdric first?

498
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:20,167
SAM: That would be too careful.

499
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:23,942
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on. Come on.

500
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:25,520
SAM: Vex! Just open it!

501
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,871
LIAM: Percival. Are there any libraries here?

502
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,182
TALIESIN: Not really, anymore.

503
00:29:33,182 --> 00:29:35,288
LIAM: What about a personal collection in your
family?

504
00:29:35,288 --> 00:29:40,563
TALIESIN: Didn't they ravage most of our
collection?

505
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:43,885
MATT: Elements have been ravaged. Elements of
family history have been destroyed so that there

506
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:52,047
couldn't be large connections, or the end of the
bloodline itself being too prominently displayed

507
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:56,567
within the castle itself. There is still a library
there, though from your knowledge-- and you've

508
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:59,962
read through most of those books growing up-- a
lot of them are loose history books; a lot of them

509
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:04,179
are more encyclopedia-like, general knowledge--

510
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:10,008
TALIESIN: She wasn't a revered deity in this part
of the world, we don't have a lot--

511
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,402
LAURA: All right, yeah, let's do it. Woods!

512
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:14,936
TRAVIS: Woods! Woods! Woods!

513
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:17,908
TALIESIN: Woods, or Vasselheim, that's actually
not a bad idea to get far away from Whitestone.

514
00:30:17,908 --> 00:30:20,655
TRAVIS: No, because then somebody else'll come
along and kill it.

515
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,010
SAM: Plus they don't like magic.

516
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,241
TALIESIN: This is sort of our secret, and we
should perhaps keep this--

517
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,705
LAURA: Okay.

518
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:30,495
TALIESIN: Well, we were going to go take a look
at--

519
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,924
MARISHA: (muffled) What if--

520
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:35,402
TRAVIS: You got shit in your mouth.

521
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:40,358
MARISHA: We g-- mm, sorry. Little bit of saliva.

522
00:30:40,358 --> 00:30:41,845
LIAM: Goodberries?

523
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:50,806
MARISHA: Snacks. We go to those goliath caves,
right outside of Whitestone, that were abandoned.

524
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:52,274
TRAVIS: Stone giant caves?

525
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:53,151
MARISHA: Those!

526
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:57,979
TRAVIS: Shit. Made me feel like I had to poop for
a second, there. Goliath caves, fuck.

527
00:30:57,979 --> 00:31:04,359
MARISHA: Sorry! I just remembered you recognized
them. They were empty, and abandoned, we could go there.

528
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,529
TRAVIS: Yeah!

529
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,398
LAURA: Is that close to your family?

530
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,444
TRAVIS: Nope.

531
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:10,269
MARISHA: No, we saw it on the way into
Whitestone.

532
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,770
TALIESIN: It's just a couple hours away, correct?

533
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,535
LAURA: Oh.

534
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:16,058
MATT: It's, I'd say roughly three, three and a
half hours northwest of here.

535
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:17,478
LAURA: Let's do it!

536
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:21,933
MATT: Yeah, it's where the forest of the Alabaster
Sierras ends and the actual Alabaster Sierra

537
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:24,378
mountain range begins, is where that transitions.

538
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:26,086
TALIESIN: We can take a day and do this.

539
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:32,288
LAURA: All right, sure. Let's do it. All right.
What do you think? Good idea? Good idea?

540
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:35,222
LIAM: Sure, yes, yes, yes, Keyleth had a good
idea, yes.

541
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:38,843
MATT: All right. So.

542
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:41,340
LAURA: We're healed, yes?

543
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,528
TALIESIN: Yes.

544
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:45,122
MARISHA: We're healed, right? Did we sleep? Do we
need to sleep?

545
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:49,020
LIAM: I thought we rested before we went down
under the water, though--

546
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,554
LAURA: No, we did, we didn't rest since then.

547
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:55,162
LIAM: I don't remember resting afterwards. And I
was there.

548
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:56,952
TRAVIS: I don't either. I remember I peed on a
lake, and then we went under it.

549
00:31:56,952 --> 00:31:59,285
MATT: Yeah, I think you guys decided instead of
resting to come to rest here in Whitestone.

550
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,646
LAURA: Yeah, we need to sleep, y'all!

551
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:02,554
TALIESIN: Let's take a sleep, and we'll do it in
the morning.

552
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:03,749
TRAVIS: What time is it, about?

553
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:07,182
MATT: I'd say by now, with as much time as you
spent in the temple, from waking up in the

554
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:14,654
morning, it's getting four in the afternoon, five
in the afternoon. The sun's starting to come down, so.

555
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:17,986
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.

556
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:21,566
SAM: Aren't we going to sleep?

557
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:24,492
LAURA: But it's four in the afternoon! There's
other things to do today.

558
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:25,576
MARISHA: Like drink?

559
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,503
LAURA: Like find out how Gilmore's doing and see
Pike.

560
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:32,250
MARISHA: And I should probably scry and check in
on Allura, right?

561
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,567
TALIESIN: I've got some work to do.

562
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,614
MATT: It's up to you guys. Yeah, and you're
starting to push towards the bottom of your

563
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:38,450
ammunition stack anyway, Percy.

564
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,599
TALIESIN: I need to, yeah, to do a little-- and
I've got a little thing I want to work on.

565
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,530
MATT: Cool. All right, so, who's doing what
first?

566
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:49,420
TALIESIN: I'm going to take Vax aside very
quickly.

567
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:57,195
TRAVIS: Let's do that first!

568
00:32:57,195 --> 00:33:04,010
TALIESIN: I had a careless moment, and I
apologize. And you're the first apology I'm

569
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:13,953
putting forward. I don't know if I would have done
anything different, but I hope you know that I

570
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:16,766
would've never forgiven myself.

571
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:19,263
LIAM: What're you talking about?

572
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:25,067
TALIESIN: I rushed in and triggered the trap that
almost killed your sister.

573
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:27,884
LIAM: That killed my sister.

574
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:30,912
TALIESIN: I can't say that.

575
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:34,407
LIAM: What do you mean?

576
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:39,939
TALIESIN: I was careless.

577
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,963
LIAM: Well, what happened, Percival?

578
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:51,756
TALIESIN: I felt the danger had passed, and I
moved too quickly, and opened the casket without

579
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:58,195
thinking. That's all. I just didn't think.

580
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:09,730
LIAM: You just opened it? Just like that?

581
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:23,009
TALIESIN: I was tired, wasn't thinking. Sometimes
we move too quickly. But I want you to know that

582
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:28,966
it would've-- I'm very glad that she's alive,
because I don't think I could have lived with

583
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,465
myself.

584
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:47,561
LIAM: All right. Could you do me a favor?

585
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:50,676
TALIESIN: Yes.

586
00:34:50,676 --> 00:35:08,875
LIAM: In the future-- If there is anything that
your little heart desires inside of a box-- In the

587
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:14,463
future, could you check with my sister or myself
first?

588
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:31,843
TALIESIN: That's the hope, yes. That was more of a
lesson than I was hoping for. Thankfully not too

589
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:34,535
much of one.

590
00:35:34,535 --> 00:35:36,437
LIAM: Well--

591
00:35:36,437 --> 00:35:42,823
TALIESIN: And none of us are beyond mistakes,
but... that is a mistake that I am going to be

592
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:53,428
thinking about for a very long time. We are going
into dangerous territory, and we all have to think

593
00:35:53,428 --> 00:36:01,628
a little bit more. And she especially, I-- I
couldn't--

594
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:09,263
LIAM: Well listen, Percy. We are not playing a
game.

595
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:11,000
TALIESIN: No.

596
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:25,303
LIAM: And we will all make mistakes, and I wager I
will make my fair share. I've little doubt. And

597
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:33,786
Percival, I want to apologize. I'm sorry. But--

598
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:38,616
And I punch him in his know-it-all fucking mouth.

599
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:44,409
MATT: Do you attempt to move out of the way, or
take it?

600
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:47,017
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's take it.

601
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:54,754
MATT: All right. (impact sound) Decks you square
in the-- for as hefty as a punch it was? Doesn't

602
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,716
hurt quite as much as you expected. But it's not
the physical pain that hurts, more than the action

603
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:07,341
and the knowledge that there are more
repercussions to your rash decision than even you

604
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:10,693
initially anticipated.

605
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:25,424
LIAM: Goodnight, Percival.

606
00:37:25,424 --> 00:37:27,944
TALIESIN: Goodnight, Vax.

607
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,549
SAM: It's four in the afternoon!

608
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:31,218
(laughter)

609
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:33,336
TALIESIN: I'm going to work. I'm going into my
studio.

610
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:35,288
MATT: All right, who else wants to do something?

611
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:37,940
MARISHA: Where'd Kima go?

612
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:50,142
MATT: Kima is actually-- she's begun day-drinking
into the night! So yeah, she's currently by

613
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:55,260
herself in one of the few functional taverns in
Whitestone. It's fairly empty at the moment,

614
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:02,047
especially at this hour as the sun slowly sets.
She's not heavy drinking but she's definitely

615
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:06,584
nursing a tankard and quietly contemplating as she
sits at the edge of the bar with her hands around

616
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:10,870
the tankard. She's staring at her reflection as
she spins it slowly on the wood. You can hear it

617
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,880
(scuffing) on the woodgrain.

618
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
MARISHA: Anyone else want to go to the--

619
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,281
LAURA: I'm going with you, yeah.

620
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:22,702
MATT: There's like a few other random patrons, but
no one catches your eye. No one specifically.

621
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:25,014
SAM: I'll come, too. Well, actually, wait. Grog,
what're you doing?

622
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:26,759
TRAVIS: Nothing yet.

623
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:28,785
SAM: I'm with Grog.

624
00:38:28,785 --> 00:38:33,511
MATT: Okay. So the two of you, into the tavern--
she doesn't notice you guys.

625
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:39,624
MARISHA: I go up and put my hand on her shoulder.

626
00:38:39,624 --> 00:38:42,082
MATT: "Keyleth!"

627
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:43,798
MARISHA: Hey! How's it going?

628
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:45,396
MATT: "Better."

629
00:38:45,396 --> 00:38:46,698
MARISHA: Yeah.

630
00:38:46,698 --> 00:38:49,221
LAURA: I lean up against the bar, next to you
guys.

631
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:53,938
MARISHA: Want to check in on Allura?

632
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:58,478
MATT: "Let's do it."

633
00:38:58,478 --> 00:39:01,127
MARISHA: Is there an empty room around here?

634
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:05,967
MATT: She looks over to the barkeep. You all stare
over and the barkeep is currently there like

635
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:11,135
wiping down the bar section. "For how long?"

636
00:39:11,135 --> 00:39:13,520
LAURA: For a couple hours.

637
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,030
MARISHA: Doesn't need to be that long.

638
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,307
MATT: "Two silver?"

639
00:39:17,307 --> 00:39:20,136
LAURA: We saved your life? And the entire town.

640
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:26,505
MATT: "You are fine to use it as you please for
the remainder of the afternoon. Just don't mess it

641
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:28,123
"up, please."

642
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:36,623
MARISHA: Sure. We'll try really hard to find
better things to do with our time. Okay.

643
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:42,457
MATT: All right, you make your way up and the
place is fairly vacant, there are a couple of

644
00:39:42,457 --> 00:39:50,938
rooms that are currently partially-- the doors are
ajar and you hear voices in there, and you

645
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:56,239
recognize it's a couple of the refugees that you
guys brought over from your keep, currently holed

646
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:01,305
up in this tavern. An inn floor on the second
floor. But there are a number of open rooms right

647
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:03,622
now that you could go ahead and step into for
use.

648
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:04,718
MARISHA: Just pick one.

649
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:07,749
MATT: Okay. So. Do you want to go ahead and
attempt a Scry ritual?

650
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:08,709
MARISHA: Yes!

651
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:10,032
MATT: Focusing on...?

652
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,948
MARISHA: The flower that I gave her before we left.

653
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:13,350
LAURA: Ooh, good call.

654
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:23,591
MATT: All right, so. As you all sit down, Kima
sitting across from you, arms closed. She looks at

655
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:29,619
you intensely with this really direct glare,
waiting for some sort of sign of an answer or

656
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:36,141
information. As you complete the ritual
preparation of the scrying, your vision transcends

657
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:42,201
your form, jettisoned through the ceiling and into
the clouds. Clouds rush past, you can feel the

658
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:49,441
wind pushing across your face, your hair, and as
the clouds part you see, below, you see Westruun.

659
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:57,747
And from Westruun you can see most of the city, as
you recall, and a large portion of it currently

660
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:09,657
looks toppled-over and pushed into ruin. There are
no longer burning black clouds, but white smoke,

661
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:16,528
long after a fire or some sort of an impact,
lazily drifting off some of those ruins. It

662
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:25,160
focuses even closer, and you see very little
populace in the streets. Most everyone's either

663
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:35,336
indoors or not visible at the moment. Your vision
clicks in once again, and you can see currently

664
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:46,802
some sort of dark room hidden in Westruun. You
see, for a brief instant, a flicker of light, and

665
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:55,265
you see Drake Thunderbrand and Allura both
gathering a few small books under their arms,

666
00:41:55,265 --> 00:42:07,984
silently waiting, quietly. You hear (impact
sounds) some heavy footfalls above. They both just

667
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:19,815
stay quiet, stay quiet. Allura stays still for a
moment. She looks over at Drake. They both take

668
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:24,533
hands and then (whoosh) convert into that same
energy form you saw that jettisoned out of

669
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:29,883
Greyskull Keep, that echoes down a long hallway
that you previously didn't see was attached to

670
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:37,701
this room. It leads to a stone spiral staircase
that goes upward before these two dual sparks

671
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:44,607
travel through the small crack between where the
edge of a trap door and a wooden floor is as the

672
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:54,726
sparks course upward into the now-setting sun. You
can see amongst the sparks the mostly collapsed

673
00:42:54,726 --> 00:43:01,961
rubble of the Cobalt Reserve, the large library in
the center of Westruun. You can see dozens of

674
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:11,927
corpses that have been largely dissolved. You can
see what remnants of their bodies have been eaten

675
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:19,463
away by some sort of caustic material, their arms
and fingers tightened up as the muscles pull into

676
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:28,594
this horrible, gnarled visage of what once were
the living residents of Westruun. You do see, as

677
00:43:28,594 --> 00:43:37,097
the spark comes to a stop for a second in its
movement, and you hear briefly overhead (wingbeats)

678
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:44,405
and you see rush overhead, wings fully
spread, the black dragon that you had briefly

679
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:54,095
encountered in Emon streak upward, roaring loudly,
towards Gatshadow, the tall, dark spire mountain

680
00:43:54,095 --> 00:44:01,519
just north of Westruun. (whoosh) And as it heads
up there, the sparks (electric sound) continue

681
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,742
their trek through the streets, and at that point
the ritual fades, its vision unable to maintain

682
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:10,858
its focus. Your vision is pulled back up into the
clouds and then thrust back into your current

683
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:13,558
position and with a shock you find yourself back in
the tavern.

684
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:17,165
LAURA: What did you see? Is she all right?

685
00:44:17,165 --> 00:44:19,463
MARISHA: She's alive, her and Drake both are
alive.

686
00:44:19,463 --> 00:44:21,308
MATT: "Good. Where are they going?"

687
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:28,115
MARISHA: They're at the Cobalt Reserve, which is
in ruins, as well as the rest of Westruun.

688
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,896
LAURA: Did you see the dragon?

689
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:38,568
MARISHA: Yes, the black dragon is there. Looks
like he's taken up residence in the black spire--

690
00:44:38,568 --> 00:44:40,686
tower. What was it called?

691
00:44:40,686 --> 00:44:41,599
LAURA: Gatshadow?

692
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,682
MARISHA: That one.

693
00:44:42,682 --> 00:44:46,244
MARISHA: Gatshadow. Allura--

694
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:48,470
LAURA: Could you communicate with her when you
scry? I don't know how it works.

695
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,058
MARISHA: No, I can just look in and see.

696
00:44:50,058 --> 00:44:51,140
LAURA: All right.

697
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:58,288
MARISHA: She was grabbing the last few important
tomes, remnants left from the Cobalt Library, I

698
00:44:58,288 --> 00:45:00,263
mean, Reserve.

699
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,737
MATT: "They staying in Westruun?"

700
00:45:01,737 --> 00:45:03,017
MARISHA: It didn't look like it.

701
00:45:03,017 --> 00:45:04,098
MATT: "Where are they going?"

702
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:05,356
MARISHA: I don't know, I didn't see.

703
00:45:05,356 --> 00:45:06,624
MATT: "Did you talk about where you--"

704
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:09,016
LAURA: We left word. And told her we were coming
here.

705
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:10,207
MATT: "Here to Whitestone?"

706
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,228
LAURA: Yes. If you wait, she'll be here.

707
00:45:13,228 --> 00:45:15,110
MATT: "Who else is coming?"

708
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,319
LAURA: Drake.

709
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,726
MATT: "Drake. Anybody else on the Council
coming?"

710
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:25,048
SAM: We brought some Council members, right? Were
any among our--

711
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:27,226
MATT: You're not there, you're with Grog.

712
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:28,829
SAM: Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, oh, I'm not
there!

713
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:30,264
(laughter)

714
00:45:30,264 --> 00:45:32,311
SAM: So, Grog! Want to play some bocce ball?

715
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:33,767
(laughter)

716
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,902
MARISHA: I don't know who all's coming.

717
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,798
LAURA: Uriel.

718
00:45:37,798 --> 00:45:48,531
MATT: "Dead? Well, that's great. That's fantastic.
What about the rest?"

719
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:50,716
MARISHA: His wife and children are here.

720
00:45:50,716 --> 00:45:51,926
MATT: "Here, okay."

721
00:45:51,926 --> 00:45:54,353
MARISHA: As well as Gilmore.

722
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:56,669
LAURA: Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

723
00:45:56,669 --> 00:45:58,535
MATT: "Right, right."

724
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:01,981
LAURA: Wonderful place to buy all sorts of
products, if it were still... standing.

725
00:46:01,981 --> 00:46:05,872
MATT: "Huh. I've only heard things, I've not met
this 'Gilmore'."

726
00:46:05,872 --> 00:46:10,400
MARISHA: You haven't met Gilmore!? Man, I just
assume everyone knows each other.

727
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,693
MATT: "Anybody else? Tofor?"

728
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:20,273
LAURA: Yes, maybe...? Yes, Tofor...?

729
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:22,227
MARISHA: He might have... been... slain...?

730
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:24,123
LAURA: Which one is Tofor?

731
00:46:24,123 --> 00:46:25,925
MARISHA: She's the dragonborn--

732
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:31,813
LAURA: Yes, Tofor-- they did, I think Tofor is--
definitely maybe here.

733
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:41,093
MATT: Last you heard, two Council members that
were confirmed still alive by Gilmore when you

734
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:57,077
found him-- or, confirmed by Uriel's wife and
family-- thank you, sorry, were Tofor and Asum.

735
00:46:57,077 --> 00:46:58,518
LAURA: Yes.

736
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:03,414
MATT: So both were two of the ones that were saved
by Gilmore, and then once he was too wounded to

737
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:07,055
continue, they left to seek for survivors in Emon.
That was the last you heard of them.

738
00:47:07,055 --> 00:47:13,465
LAURA: Oh. They're not actually here, then. Yes.
They're looking for other survivors, Tofor and Asum.

739
00:47:13,465 --> 00:47:21,094
MATT: "In the place where this-- and what's this
dragon you keep talking about?"

740
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:26,319
LAURA: Oh, shit, you don't know anything. Thordak!
Big. Terrible. Red.

741
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:32,463
MATT: As you say the name again, you can see her
eyes resonate with a clarity, and where once was

742
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:44,642
this very intense expression and air of demanding
information suddenly recedes into this look of

743
00:47:44,642 --> 00:47:48,044
sudden fear, and she's briefly lost in thought.

744
00:47:48,044 --> 00:47:52,195
LAURA: Yes, you defeated him once. He escaped the
Fire Realm.

745
00:47:52,195 --> 00:48:06,795
MARISHA: Not only did he escape, he tore a giant
tear in the rifts between the Fire Realm and ours.

746
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:18,822
MATT: (sighs deeply) "Thordak." And you can see,
she's starting to hyperventilate suddenly, like,

747
00:48:18,822 --> 00:48:26,617
for all of her strong exterior, this is the first
time, aside from the brief hit of the beholder's

748
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:32,663
ray earlier, you see fear in her eyes, and she
starts standing up. (pants) "I need to get some air."

749
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:33,880
MARISHA: Kima, Kima, it'll be--

750
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,089
MATT: "I need to--"

751
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:36,796
MARISHA: Sit here, you want to sit down?

752
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:38,093
MATT: "I need to get s-- I need to get some air."

753
00:48:38,093 --> 00:48:39,225
And she storms out of the room.

754
00:48:39,225 --> 00:48:40,622
MARISHA: Let's go outside.

755
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:41,543
LAURA: Actually, Keyleth--

756
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,325
MARISHA: What?

757
00:48:42,325 --> 00:48:43,782
LAURA: I shut the door behind Kima.

758
00:48:43,782 --> 00:48:44,716
MARISHA: Okay.

759
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,050
LAURA: I want to talk to you.

760
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,126
MARISHA: Yeah.

761
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:54,242
LAURA: I would ask my brother, but, knowing him,
he would walk away. What happened?

762
00:48:54,242 --> 00:48:59,720
MARISHA: Keyleth has a hard time looking her in
the eye.

763
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:08,543
LAURA: Look at me, Keyleth! Be strong! You're
royalty. Tell me what happened.

764
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:21,208
MARISHA: Vex, I don't want to ever see you like
that again. I don't want to ever see anybody like

765
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,700
that again.

766
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:33,045
LAURA: I grab both sides of her face and force her
to look at me. I'm all right. I'm still here.

767
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:46,936
Okay? I need you to tell me what happened. Because
between us? Vax is off. Something's wrong. And I

768
00:49:46,936 --> 00:49:49,354
need to know what it is.

769
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:51,307
MARISHA: We all watched you die.

770
00:49:51,307 --> 00:49:52,702
LAURA: Yes.

771
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:53,851
MARISHA: It's like--

772
00:49:53,851 --> 00:50:04,039
LAURA: How did I get back? Who brought me back?
Kashaw, Zahra, my brother. Anyone else?

773
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:13,241
MARISHA: I guess... you could say, probably an
unseen entity, an unseen force. Oh, I'm

774
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:14,531
lightheaded.

775
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:15,702
LAURA: Sit down.

776
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:16,608
MARISHA: Okay.

777
00:50:16,608 --> 00:50:18,226
LAURA: There's a bed. Sit down.

778
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:24,775
MARISHA: Percy--

779
00:50:24,775 --> 00:50:26,730
LAURA: Percy helped.

780
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:39,326
MARISHA: Let's skip that. When we brought you
back, Kashaw performed a resurrection ritual.

781
00:50:39,326 --> 00:50:40,977
LAURA: Like we did with Pike.

782
00:50:40,977 --> 00:50:49,631
MARISHA: Yes. And he called upon a deity and at
first he was afraid that it was Vesh. Which he was

783
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,802
quite terrified about.

784
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:52,838
LAURA: His wife.

785
00:50:52,838 --> 00:51:02,206
MARISHA: Yes. That, I don't believe, is the
presence that answered his call.

786
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:10,042
LAURA: Okay. Fluttery words here, darling. Get to
the point.

787
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:20,362
MARISHA: I thought I was going to lose you both. I
thought I was going to lose you and Vax.

788
00:51:20,362 --> 00:51:27,367
LAURA: Why Vax? Did he get hurt as well? No. What
did he do?

789
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:44,585
MARISHA: He-- I don't know. I don't know what he
did. He said to take him instead, is what he told

790
00:51:44,585 --> 00:51:58,143
the entity. He offered his life for yours. And my
biggest fear was that neither of you were going to

791
00:51:58,143 --> 00:52:13,757
come back. He offered his life for you. And for
all we know, that offer was accepted.

792
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:17,738
LAURA: Right.

793
00:52:17,738 --> 00:52:25,351
MARISHA: If I had to guess, it was probably the
Raven Queen herself.

794
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:29,250
LAURA: Well. It's rather suiting, isn't it?

795
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:35,427
MARISHA: He seems to do that quite a lot.

796
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:46,796
LAURA: Yes. Keyleth? Thank you, dear. And I
leave.

797
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,002
MATT: Okay.

798
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:54,010
MARISHA: I stay behind and burst into tears.

799
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:58,965
MATT: Okay. Grog and Scanlan! What're you guys
doing?

800
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:01,579
(relieved laughter)

801
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:02,957
LIAM: (Grog voice) Go fish.

802
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:05,119
TRAVIS: So-- what do you want to do?

803
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:15,439
SAM: I don't know. I hadn't really thought about
it. Do you have any games with you?

804
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:17,788
TRAVIS: No.

805
00:53:17,788 --> 00:53:21,772
SAM: Anything in the Bag of Holding?

806
00:53:21,772 --> 00:53:27,841
TRAVIS: I think there's some orc parts in there
that've been in for a couple months.

807
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:29,879
SAM: Doesn't sound very fun.

808
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:34,406
TRAVIS: Right. I got all nervous when they
mentioned a goliath's cave, so I need to go

809
00:53:34,406 --> 00:53:35,740
boom-boom.

810
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:39,406
SAM: Should I play a song so no one can hear it?

811
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:43,222
TRAVIS: Might help. Like, stand guard outside the
door.

812
00:53:43,222 --> 00:53:46,325
SAM: Yeah, yeah. A little muzak.

813
00:53:46,325 --> 00:53:47,791
TRAVIS: Would you mind?

814
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,771
SAM: It's what I'm here for.

815
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:52,573
TRAVIS: Can I go drop some ordnance?

816
00:53:52,573 --> 00:54:03,020
MATT: And as you find one of the few local
ramshackle outhouses-- none are quite

817
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,917
goliath-sized, and it's an uncomfortable
experience, but thank God you brought a bard along

818
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:11,412
or you would have woken up half the populace just
going to bed, as Scanlan, I--

819
00:54:11,412 --> 00:54:22,513
SAM: Nothing to see here, everybody! (plays random
chords on the harmonica) Nothing to see here!

820
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:24,081
TRAVIS: (coughs, then farts) Oh!

821
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:25,429
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

822
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:29,019
(laughter)

823
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:32,206
TRAVIS: Now, the music's playing, right?

824
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:33,302
MATT: Yeah.

825
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,456
TRAVIS: It's just a stall, just me?

826
00:54:35,456 --> 00:54:36,597
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

827
00:54:36,597 --> 00:54:38,393
TRAVIS: All right, can I take out Craven Edge?

828
00:54:38,393 --> 00:54:39,597
MATT: Yeah.

829
00:54:39,597 --> 00:54:41,259
TRAVIS: All right.

830
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:44,553
MARISHA: In the outhouse? Sorry, keep going!

831
00:54:44,553 --> 00:54:50,034
TRAVIS: It's the palace, this is where all the
best thoughts and conversations happen! I don't

832
00:54:50,034 --> 00:54:51,419
know how it is at your house.

833
00:54:51,419 --> 00:54:53,150
LIAM: Keep in mind how confined it is, okay?

834
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:54,013
TRAVIS: Yeah!

835
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:54,963
LIAM: And go.

836
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:57,465
(laughter)

837
00:54:57,515 --> 00:55:02,222
MATT: Yes. (grunting)

838
00:55:02,222 --> 00:55:04,341
SAM: Sounds like a rough one in there, buddy!

839
00:55:04,341 --> 00:55:08,743
MATT: As you (chuckles) as you see one of the wood
boards splinter out the side for a second--

840
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:10,764
SAM: Ah, yup, that's tacos!

841
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:20,724
TRAVIS: You might want to play a bit louder and
maybe take a few steps away, it's about to get violent.

842
00:55:20,724 --> 00:55:22,036
SAM: No problem!

843
00:55:22,036 --> 00:55:23,436
TRAVIS: Yep.

844
00:55:23,436 --> 00:55:28,166
MATT: At that moment you focus, and as you can
feel the blade itself grow cold in your fingertips,

845
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:35,328
you can see what little bit of light that filters
through the bright orangish-red color that's

846
00:55:35,328 --> 00:55:39,503
coming from the sunset, you can see a reflection
in the obsidian blade as a voice comes to your ear

847
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:43,042
and says, "You fed me well."

848
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:52,963
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, right? I mean, we are really
doing well. Question: so, when we were fighting

849
00:55:52,963 --> 00:56:01,869
that big Earthbreaker Groot-looking guy, he called
you a 'dark weapon'. Does that-- do you have

850
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:04,977
feelings, and did that hurt them?

851
00:56:04,977 --> 00:56:13,803
MATT: There's a brief pause before you hear this
long, drawn-out, (heavy sigh).

852
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:19,456
TRAVIS: Right, hold on! No, no, listen. And I take
my thumb and I run it against the blade real quick.

853
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:24,512
MATT: Okay. As you do, all of a sudden the voice
goes, (gasp, contented exhale).

854
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:30,300
TRAVIS: Right, yep, sorry, listen. So, my question
is, as much as I love opening up people to feed

855
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:36,133
you, I want to know, like-- what's in it for you?

856
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:41,196
SAM: Grog, are you talking to your shit?

857
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:43,267
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, you got to let it know who's
boss!

858
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:44,805
SAM: Okay.

859
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:53,703
MATT: The voice creeps in again, this time. "There
is no feeling more terrifying than hunger. And I

860
00:56:53,703 --> 00:57:03,425
"hunger forever. You help satiate that hunger. That
is our arrangement. I give you the strength of

861
00:57:03,425 --> 00:57:12,680
"those you cut down, and I feed upon them. If this
is unsatisfactory, I can and have found others who

862
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,419
"are more willing to be part of this
arrangement--"

863
00:57:15,419 --> 00:57:20,733
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I'm a big fan, really, I mean,
I am yoked out when I'm using you, it's fucking

864
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:29,443
amazing. I mean, people are flying apart, it's
like a dream. But listen, can you ever be... full?

865
00:57:29,443 --> 00:57:35,895
MATT: "I have never been full before. Perhaps
you're the one to find out."

866
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:39,896
TRAVIS: I'll bet I am, actually, you're really
lucky you found me and not these other blokes, not

867
00:57:39,896 --> 00:57:47,627
even half the man I am. But listen, so, there's
no, like, endgame, just to be clear, you just want

868
00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:52,222
to drink and drink, 'cause I've seen the blood,
right? And usually I wipe it off, but you, like,

869
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:56,049
suck it in, and that's a little unsettling, not
going to lie.

870
00:57:56,049 --> 00:58:09,283
MATT: "My hunger grows, but the air tarnishes my
blade. Perhaps we can continue this conversation

871
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:11,202
"elsewhere."

872
00:58:11,202 --> 00:58:18,089
TRAVIS: (farts) Right, yeah, right. Not even a
problem. Well, look, I like the way you cut

873
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:22,915
people open, so we'll continue this another time.
And I sheathe him.

874
00:58:22,915 --> 00:58:31,652
MATT: All right. As you sheathe, the last thing he
says is, "Don't forget: I hunger always."

875
00:58:31,652 --> 00:58:41,566
TRAVIS: I kick the door open, and I'm like, if
you're within 200 feet, back up!

876
00:58:41,566 --> 00:58:45,355
SAM: No one's out here, Grog.

877
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,403
TRAVIS: Oh.

878
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:48,206
SAM: Just me. Are you all right?

879
00:58:48,206 --> 00:58:49,084
TRAVIS: Yeah.

880
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:50,958
SAM: I heard you say something about blood.

881
00:58:51,008 --> 00:58:54,003
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, am I sweating? It was a real
workout, that one.

882
00:58:54,003 --> 00:58:59,649
SAM: At some point you said, "Are you full?" Are
you talking about-- did you fill it all the way up?

883
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:02,235
TRAVIS: Yeah, the privy, you know, it was starting
to give my bum a tickle.

884
00:59:02,235 --> 00:59:04,018
SAM: Wow!

885
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:04,821
TRAVIS: Yeah.

886
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:05,835
SAM: You topped it off!

887
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:07,830
TRAVIS: Yeah. Because, you know, you don't want
to, like, dip in the muck, it's, you know--

888
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:08,853
LAURA: Foul.

889
00:59:08,853 --> 00:59:09,867
SAM: Not at all.

890
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:11,078
TRAVIS: Did you want to--

891
00:59:11,078 --> 00:59:11,994
SAM: I think I'm good.

892
00:59:11,994 --> 00:59:14,913
TRAVIS: Are you sure? I warmed it up for you,
it's, like, ready to go.

893
00:59:14,913 --> 00:59:17,776
SAM: I love a good deuce, but not today, I think.

894
00:59:17,776 --> 00:59:24,700
TRAVIS: All right. Fair enough. But I'm feeling so,
like, vacated--

895
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,147
SAM: We should go get a bite.

896
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:27,558
TRAVIS: I think you're right!

897
00:59:27,558 --> 00:59:28,941
SAM: (laughs) All right, let's go.

898
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,186
TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay.

899
00:59:30,186 --> 00:59:35,221
MATT: Okay. You guys are getting a bite. Percival,
if you want to go ahead and make a tinkering check

900
00:59:35,221 --> 00:59:37,457
with dexterity modifier to create more
ammunition.

901
00:59:37,457 --> 00:59:39,381
TALIESIN: Tinkering check with dexterity
modifier?

902
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:40,250
MATT: Yes.

903
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,464
TALIESIN: Okay.

904
00:59:41,464 --> 00:59:43,294
MATT: Should be plus 11.

905
00:59:43,294 --> 00:59:45,589
TALIESIN: 16.

906
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:52,159
MATT: 16, okay. We'll say, in the time that you've
had here, with the materials you purchased, and

907
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,538
Whitestone's pretty open to supplying you--

908
00:59:56,538 --> 00:59:57,769
TALIESIN: I've got a thing.

909
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:03,733
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you're able to create roughly
40 or so simple bullets in the time that you have.

910
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:11,319
TALIESIN: Do I have time to poke at a modification
to the explosive arrow? I want to try and build a

911
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:17,192
rock breaker. I'm curious to try and build an
arrow for taking down walls or taking down doors.

912
01:00:17,192 --> 01:00:18,587
MATT: Like a siege arrow?

913
01:00:18,587 --> 01:00:26,112
TALIESIN: A light form of siege arrow. Basically,
I want to have a tip that actually manages to

914
01:00:26,112 --> 01:00:30,247
breach stone and then an explosion that goes
outwards, so it's a shattering arrow.

915
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:35,158
MATT: All right, this'll take the remainder of
your evening. You're not going to be able to do

916
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:36,337
much else after this.

917
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:37,452
TALIESIN: I have nothing else to do.

918
01:00:37,452 --> 01:00:39,875
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a tinkering
check with your intelligence modifier.

919
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:50,796
TALIESIN: Okay. So... That's 23.

920
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:57,241
MATT: 23, okay. At the cost of roughly 150 gold
pieces, as you have to go through a few different

921
01:00:57,241 --> 01:01:04,057
attempts to finally get the design right, and the
metalworking you have here is not perfected.

922
01:01:04,057 --> 01:01:07,244
You're not at your workshop back at the keep,
unfortunately, so you have to work with whatever

923
01:01:07,244 --> 01:01:09,137
you have here, and nothing here is designed for
the--

924
01:01:09,137 --> 01:01:11,157
TALIESIN: No, I've got an okay workshop here.

925
01:01:11,157 --> 01:01:13,931
MATT: Yeah. The one that you used before,
previously, but that's from mostly discarded

926
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:20,046
and-- in the time that you've been gone, it's been
cannibalized for a lot of different uses. But it's

927
01:01:20,046 --> 01:01:25,000
makeshift. You manage to complete what you think
could function. You're not entirely certain as to

928
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,127
what the final effect will be, but it all seems to
be in place.

929
01:01:28,127 --> 01:01:30,331
TALIESIN: All right.

930
01:01:30,331 --> 01:01:34,404
MATT: So you can write down 'Explosive Siege
Arrow'.

931
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:35,842
TALIESIN: Siege arrow.

932
01:01:35,842 --> 01:01:41,258
MATT: And we shall find out in time what it does.

933
01:01:41,258 --> 01:01:44,726
MARISHA: Siege arrow. That's fun.

934
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:48,374
TALIESIN: A few things I've been working on, and
that's one of them.

935
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:51,614
MATT: So. Are you guys resting for the evening?
Anything else you wish to accomplish?

936
01:01:51,614 --> 01:01:56,545
LAURA: That would probably be smart. I'm pretty tired
after dying, so I'm going to go to sleep.

937
01:01:56,545 --> 01:01:58,348
MATT: Okay. Vax, anything you want to accomplish
before you--

938
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,417
TALIESIN: God, the guilt. Okay. Yeah.

939
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:04,021
SAM: Can I buy a torch somewhere? Just a torch?

940
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,920
MATT: Sure! Yeah, torches are relatively easy to
find. You want to try one?

941
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,257
SAM: Three.

942
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,818
MATT: Three torches. That's three copper.

943
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:11,827
LAURA: I bring Trinket into the castle with me,
just so you know.

944
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:18,598
MATT: After all this has happened, Trinket has
been, like, almost locked to you. Even you going

945
01:02:18,598 --> 01:02:22,691
upstairs into the tavern, Trinket was like,
(plaintive bear noises) stayed out front, 'cause

946
01:02:22,691 --> 01:02:25,052
Trinket's learned at this point, you can't really
go into all the taverns.

947
01:02:25,052 --> 01:02:26,446
LAURA: It's hard, it's hard.

948
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:27,952
MATT: It's rough, being a bear.

949
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:34,212
SAM: And wherever we're eating, does it happen to
be near Jameson the painter's workshop?

950
01:02:34,212 --> 01:02:40,483
MATT: No, but it's about a 20-minute walk, if you
wanted to go find him.

951
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:46,133
SAM: Be nice to check in with him. Grog, do you
mind walking with me?

952
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:47,582
TRAVIS: Absolutely not.

953
01:02:47,582 --> 01:02:50,058
SAM: All right, so we'll truck on over to
Jameson's.

954
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:56,437
MATT: Okay. You head up to it, and this gentleman
is a painter as well as a stablehand, so you find

955
01:02:56,437 --> 01:03:03,145
your way to the facility, knock on it, and
immediately as the door opens, the smell of fresh

956
01:03:03,145 --> 01:03:07,885
manure hits your nose and Jameson steps out. "Can
I-- you!"

957
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:08,935
SAM: Yes! Hi!

958
01:03:08,935 --> 01:03:10,090
MATT: "Hi!"

959
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,179
SAM: I've come back.

960
01:03:11,179 --> 01:03:15,154
MATT: "I meant to deliver, but they told me not
to, because apparently it's not there anymore?"

961
01:03:15,154 --> 01:03:17,008
SAM: The town, you mean.

962
01:03:17,008 --> 01:03:18,847
MATT: "Town, yeah, where I was supposed to deliver
it to you."

963
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:24,168
SAM: It was wise of you to keep this precious
artifact here, because it would've surely been

964
01:03:24,168 --> 01:03:25,833
destroyed en route or when it arrived--

965
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:29,710
MATT: "It's just the canvas, I don't have a-- It's
a bit too large for my specifications of framing, but--"

966
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,373
SAM: I'm sure it's huge. Did you finish it?

967
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:32,613
MATT: "Yes, yes! Come, come!"

968
01:03:32,613 --> 01:03:33,686
SAM: Can I look?

969
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:34,947
TRAVIS: Oh please, oh please!

970
01:03:34,947 --> 01:03:36,210
SAM: (laughing) Okay, let's go look!

971
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:41,120
MATT: He takes one of the hooded lanterns and
turns up the oil wick on it, and as he turns away

972
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:45,437
he brings you into the back stable area where it's
been sectioned off, and you can see there's paints

973
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:49,144
that have been dropped all across the ground and
the hay, it's this multicolored spattering, this

974
01:03:49,144 --> 01:03:57,483
rainbow vomit across this section of hay floor,
and there in all of its glory, stretched across

975
01:03:57,483 --> 01:04:04,704
and nailed at the corners to this far, far wall,
you see a fantastical landscape of rolling hills

976
01:04:04,704 --> 01:04:10,890
and treelines rising up at the edges. You can see
a mountainscape in the distance. The lighting he

977
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:15,795
uses is magnificent. You can see why many people
in the city specifically requested that you go to

978
01:04:15,795 --> 01:04:25,034
this gentleman. There atop this fantastic green
hilltop, you see on this fine white and grey steed

979
01:04:25,034 --> 01:04:33,906
as it raises up, hooves in the air, is yourself,
shirt open, chest slightly fuzzy and muscular. As

980
01:04:33,906 --> 01:04:36,215
you look off, your hair blowing in the breeze--

981
01:04:36,215 --> 01:04:37,658
SAM: How's the face? How's the face?

982
01:04:37,658 --> 01:04:39,580
MATT: The face is pretty damn spot-on.

983
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,696
SAM: Yes!

984
01:04:40,696 --> 01:04:42,481
(laughter)

985
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:46,114
MATT: The best likeness you can find for somebody
who only had a brief reference, as he sketched you

986
01:04:46,114 --> 01:04:51,065
quickly before he left, and there behind,
clutching you, from the side you can see Pike

987
01:04:51,065 --> 01:04:59,516
wearing these long greyish-silver and blue robes
that are also flowing behind, a long train--

988
01:04:59,516 --> 01:05:05,380
longer than it needs to be, stylistically it was a
choice in the artistics point of this-- it is

989
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:09,640
everything you hoped it would be. You paid good
money for this piece.

990
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:14,352
SAM: I'm going to request-- Grog, I need a minute
here.

991
01:05:14,352 --> 01:05:17,114
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. I understand, take--

992
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:18,295
SAM: Just to weep.

993
01:05:18,295 --> 01:05:19,594
TRAVIS: Take all the time you need.

994
01:05:19,594 --> 01:05:25,723
SAM: So I regard it for a few minutes, taking in
the beauty and the wonder of all I've

995
01:05:25,723 --> 01:05:27,158
accomplished--

996
01:05:27,158 --> 01:05:32,759
MARISHA: I have a question. Would Keyleth and
Scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time?

997
01:05:32,759 --> 01:05:35,815
MATT: Right now? Yes. For different reasons
entirely.

998
01:05:35,815 --> 01:05:39,264
SAM and TALIESIN: (singing) Somewhere out
there...

999
01:05:39,264 --> 01:05:41,187
TRAVIS: Look at the air, look at the air
high-five. There it is.

1000
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,670
SAM, TALIESIN and MARISHA: (singing) Beneath the
pale moonlight

1001
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:46,555
TRAVIS: So white. That was the whitest of white
high fives ever.

1002
01:05:46,555 --> 01:05:55,267
TALIESIN: I'm imagining this as a canvas of Lisa
Frank majesty, by the way. Like, the greatest Lisa

1003
01:05:55,267 --> 01:05:57,730
Frank Trapper Keeper cover in all the land.

1004
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,014
MATT: Oh, man.

1005
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:00,803
(laughter)

1006
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:06,086
SAM: After I weep for a few minutes, I thank
Jameson again and how much did I pay him for this

1007
01:06:06,086 --> 01:06:16,541
thing? You've gone above and beyond, Jameson, and
I know that you're a humble man and you don't want

1008
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:22,818
me to spread word of your accomplishments, but
please allow me to write you an epic poem or a

1009
01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:27,526
song and tell of your artistic gifts and talents,
please.

1010
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,179
MATT: "That would be a fine tip, sir. Please, yes,
do so."

1011
01:06:31,179 --> 01:06:32,459
SAM: I'll get right on it.

1012
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:36,085
MATT: "Send them back to Whitestone, please, ask
for Jameson. The more I work this, hopefully I can

1013
01:06:36,085 --> 01:06:38,448
"make my way out of this dunghole."

1014
01:06:38,448 --> 01:06:41,678
SAM: Don't worry, you'll have lots of commissions
after this, I promise you.

1015
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:42,640
MATT: "Great."

1016
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,903
SAM: And I'm going to give him an extra 50 gold.

1017
01:06:44,903 --> 01:06:47,273
MATT: "I, um--"

1018
01:06:47,273 --> 01:06:49,285
LIAM: That's more than the price of a book.

1019
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:53,961
MATT: "Sir, I-- thank you. Thank you, thank you."

1020
01:06:53,961 --> 01:06:58,876
SAM: For art supplies to get your shop up and
running.

1021
01:06:58,876 --> 01:07:02,152
MATT: "Of course." He looks down and he's gotten a
little bit of paint on the coins, he's like,

1022
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:06,021
(muttering and stammering). He puts it aside
somewhere. "Thank you--" Wipes his hands off on a

1023
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:08,606
nearby rag. "Thank you." And takes your hand and
shakes it vigorously.

1024
01:07:08,606 --> 01:07:10,855
SAM: So, can it be--

1025
01:07:10,855 --> 01:07:14,403
MATT: Yeah, he goes in and he takes his little
claw hammer down, starts pulling the nails out

1026
01:07:14,403 --> 01:07:18,952
from the sides and gingerly rolls up the canvas.
It takes a good, like, three minutes to roll the

1027
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:24,507
thing up, and it's quite heavy as he hands it over
to you-- (heavy grunt) In your hand, yeah, it

1028
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:25,814
almost takes you off your feet.

1029
01:07:25,814 --> 01:07:26,838
SAM: Grog! Grog!

1030
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:27,660
TRAVIS: What?

1031
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,673
SAM: Can you hold this for me?

1032
01:07:28,673 --> 01:07:30,216
TRAVIS: No, it's you, I mean, you're so
magnificent in it--

1033
01:07:30,216 --> 01:07:31,442
SAM: No, I can't do it.

1034
01:07:31,442 --> 01:07:32,826
TRAVIS: I don't know it-- I really--

1035
01:07:32,826 --> 01:07:35,132
SAM: Grog! I watched you shit for an hour!

1036
01:07:35,132 --> 01:07:37,911
TRAVIS: Hey, all right, I'll pick it up.

1037
01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:43,634
MATT: All right. You guys find your way out. At
this point night has taken; you can hear the

1038
01:07:43,634 --> 01:07:50,820
crickets starting to spread throughout the city.
As the rest of the blue night sky takes on--

1039
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:56,366
Evening is ready, do you guys have anything else
to accomplish before the evening comes to a close?

1040
01:07:56,366 --> 01:08:06,788
LIAM: Wait 'til it's quiet. And I leave the room
that I've been given at Whitestone. And I find my

1041
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:17,001
sister's door. And I stand outside it, and I stare
at it for a minute--

1042
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:19,620
LAURA: Vax? Is that you?

1043
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,553
LIAM: And I stealth away.

1044
01:08:22,553 --> 01:08:25,004
LAURA: I open the door.

1045
01:08:25,004 --> 01:08:32,327
MATT: Roll a stealth check, roll a perception
check.

1046
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:35,415
LAURA: Shit.

1047
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:38,942
LIAM: 25.

1048
01:08:38,942 --> 01:08:40,787
LAURA: 22. Damn it.

1049
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,410
MATT: Nothing to be seen. Must have been your
imagination, Vex.

1050
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,280
TRAVIS: He's good.

1051
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:56,932
LIAM: And I wait for the door to close. And then I
walk to Keyleth's door. And I knock.

1052
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:59,912
MATT: You hear a knock at your door.

1053
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:01,516
LAURA: And horses.

1054
01:09:01,516 --> 01:09:04,122
MATT: The clomping of horse hooves in the
distance, apparently.

1055
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:16,247
MARISHA: I open it. Hey. Hi. You okay?

1056
01:09:16,247 --> 01:09:22,268
LIAM: I don't know.

1057
01:09:22,268 --> 01:09:25,742
MARISHA: Come in. Sit down.

1058
01:09:25,742 --> 01:09:27,810
LIAM: I go in.

1059
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,432
MATT: Okay.

1060
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:33,541
MARISHA: How do you feel?

1061
01:09:33,541 --> 01:10:09,721
LIAM: I don't know. All I know is... that I felt
her. I don't know magic, I don't know anything. I

1062
01:10:09,721 --> 01:10:14,397
open doors, and only when the wind is blowing in
the right direction, sometimes, I think. I don't

1063
01:10:14,397 --> 01:10:18,935
know what happened, but I felt her.

1064
01:10:18,935 --> 01:10:23,888
MARISHA: Do you still feel her?

1065
01:10:23,888 --> 01:10:34,253
MATT: Make a perception check, Vax.

1066
01:10:34,253 --> 01:10:36,255
LIAM: 22.

1067
01:10:36,255 --> 01:10:41,183
MATT: As you're sitting there, looking down at the
ground, as she asks this question, you notice the

1068
01:10:41,183 --> 01:10:46,294
symbol of Sarenrae that you have stitched into the
back of your glove, what was once a very vibrant,

1069
01:10:46,294 --> 01:10:53,964
goldish-brass color has actually very heavily
tarnished, and the metal itself seems to have

1070
01:10:53,964 --> 01:10:58,011
cracked in three places. It was not this way a
day before.

1071
01:10:58,011 --> 01:11:16,765
LIAM: Yeah. I don't know if I did anything in
there, and I wouldn't take it back if I did, but I

1072
01:11:16,765 --> 01:11:20,734
don't know what I'm doing.

1073
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:26,503
MARISHA: I don't know if it was very noble or very
stupid, to be honest. Probably a little bit of

1074
01:11:26,503 --> 01:11:40,487
both. I can attempt a Greater Restoration spell,
and see if I can sense anything.

1075
01:11:40,487 --> 01:11:49,092
LIAM: I don't know anything about any of that.
I'll let you.

1076
01:11:49,092 --> 01:11:53,898
MARISHA: Can I?

1077
01:11:53,898 --> 01:12:01,161
MATT: Yeah. So as you prepare your mindset for the
cleansing ritual that is the Greater

1078
01:12:01,161 --> 01:12:02,302
Restoration--

1079
01:12:02,302 --> 01:12:04,145
MARISHA: Just lay back.

1080
01:12:04,145 --> 01:12:11,811
MATT: As soon as the dull green energy begins to
course across your fingertips, and as you touch

1081
01:12:11,811 --> 01:12:17,601
the edge of his shoulder to impart his body with
the cleansing energy, it courses through his

1082
01:12:17,601 --> 01:12:27,852
shoulders, the spell completes. You sense no
difference in your current physicality, mindset,

1083
01:12:27,852 --> 01:12:33,541
and there's this pause, this silence, of no
realization, that is suddenly shattered by the

1084
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:38,338
sound of a (caws). You look over and at the stone
edge of the window you guys are staying in, you

1085
01:12:38,338 --> 01:12:46,115
see stepping there a single dark raven, (clicks,
rapid flapping) and it takes off and flies into

1086
01:12:46,115 --> 01:12:48,007
the night.

1087
01:12:48,007 --> 01:13:09,556
MARISHA: I think this goes beyond any natural
realm that I have any bearing over. And I hug him.

1088
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:25,133
I thought I was going to lose you. And I'm
terrified I'm still going to.

1089
01:13:25,133 --> 01:13:38,190
LIAM: Keyleth, I love you.

1090
01:13:38,190 --> 01:14:07,782
MARISHA: And I think I love you. I just don't know if I
can allow myself to. I'm terrified to allow myself

1091
01:14:07,782 --> 01:14:38,052
to. You do realize that, if by some crazy chance,
we all somehow make it through this domination

1092
01:14:38,052 --> 01:14:50,112
alive, with the Chroma Conclave, and I complete my
Aramente, I'll still watch all of you die.

1093
01:14:50,112 --> 01:15:17,250
Everything could go phenomenally well. And by
becoming Headmaster, we enter a bit of a realm of

1094
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:38,053
immortality where I could live for a very, very
long time. I'm afraid every time I look at one of

1095
01:15:38,053 --> 01:16:02,917
your faces that it's going to be the last, and I
feel like deep down I know that day is coming. So

1096
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:14,060
because of that I'm afraid to let myself feel
anything deeper than I already do.

1097
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:23,619
LIAM: I quickly leave her room.

1098
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:29,128
MATT: The door closes behind Vax.

1099
01:16:29,128 --> 01:16:41,931
MARISHA: And for the second time today Keyleth
bursts into tears. Why do people keep leaving me

1100
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,853
in rooms alone?

1101
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:48,012
MATT: All right.

1102
01:16:48,012 --> 01:16:49,961
TALIESIN: Stop it, you're wasting water.

1103
01:16:49,961 --> 01:16:52,817
MARISHA: We're in a drought, god damn it!

1104
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,504
LAURA: When was the last time you showered,
Keyleth?

1105
01:16:54,504 --> 01:16:56,107
MARISHA: It's been a while.

1106
01:16:56,107 --> 01:16:57,435
TALIESIN: Makeup's runny.

1107
01:16:57,435 --> 01:16:58,953
LIAM: Go water elemental.

1108
01:16:58,953 --> 01:17:05,278
MATT: It's the only way. All right, as you all find
yourself coming to rest for the evening, some of

1109
01:17:05,278 --> 01:17:15,481
you easier than others, eventually you get your
full rest. Those who heal up to, say, full hit

1110
01:17:15,481 --> 01:17:19,485
points for a good night's rest here, get your hit
dice back, so not a whole lot were spent.

1111
01:17:19,485 --> 01:17:22,141
TRAVIS: I lose my strength bonuses.

1112
01:17:22,141 --> 01:17:25,942
MATT: Morning comes to you all, and-- yes?

1113
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:31,797
LIAM: Sorry, just one detail. From there, I went
and fell asleep in this idiot's doorway.

1114
01:17:31,797 --> 01:17:37,035
MATT: Okay. All right. We will go ahead and take a
quick break, we will see you guys back here

1115
01:17:37,035 --> 01:17:43,344
shortly to see what is in store for Vox Machina.
So we'll be back here in a minute.

1116
01:17:43,344 --> 01:31:52,301
[break]

1117
01:31:52,301 --> 01:31:53,694
LIAM: Matt, shit on my face.

1118
01:31:53,694 --> 01:31:55,217
MATT: Welcome back, everybody!

1119
01:31:55,217 --> 01:31:56,798
SAM: It's too close!

1120
01:31:56,798 --> 01:31:58,212
LAURA: They caught it, that one caught it.

1121
01:31:58,212 --> 01:31:59,519
MATT: That was pretty close.

1122
01:31:59,519 --> 01:32:00,687
LIAM: All they heard was "ace."

1123
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:03,479
MATT: It's all good. Welcome back, guys. We're
going to go ahead and jump back in. So as you all,

1124
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:09,883
after that, for some, emotional evening, whether
that be conversational emotion or, you know,

1125
01:32:09,883 --> 01:32:16,024
having to go drop an emotional deuce. You know,
that's important. You find yourselves waking up to

1126
01:32:16,024 --> 01:32:21,658
a fresh morning in Whitestone, hints of blue sky
breaking through the cloud coverage, and that's

1127
01:32:21,658 --> 01:32:24,834
rare for this area because it's the northern
portion of the continent, you know that,

1128
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:31,328
especially being so close to the ocean, a lot of
the cloud, heavy precipitation makes its way in

1129
01:32:31,328 --> 01:32:37,338
the direction of your town, so it's nice to have a
little break in that. Nonetheless, as you guys

1130
01:32:37,338 --> 01:32:40,308
come to consciousness and gather yourselves, your
things, and your plans for the day, what do you

1131
01:32:40,308 --> 01:32:41,315
wish to do?

1132
01:32:41,315 --> 01:32:43,300
TALIESIN: We are a city of seasonal affectation
disorder, so.

1133
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:47,739
LAURA: Well, I open my door and find my brother
falling through it.

1134
01:32:47,739 --> 01:32:51,524
LIAM: I'm awake.

1135
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:53,069
LAURA: Oh, good morning.

1136
01:32:53,069 --> 01:32:54,325
LIAM: Hi.

1137
01:32:54,325 --> 01:32:56,041
LAURA: Comfortable bed, I see.

1138
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:59,665
LIAM: Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't find my room.

1139
01:32:59,665 --> 01:33:04,000
LAURA: Yeah, it's confusing, all these, all these
doors.

1140
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,299
LIAM: What time's it?

1141
01:33:05,299 --> 01:33:12,925
LAURA: I have no idea. My nature check tells me
it's roughly, I dunno, eight? Nine? Something like

1142
01:33:12,925 --> 01:33:15,161
that. Seven? Maybe seven.

1143
01:33:15,161 --> 01:33:19,769
LIAM: Come here, you shithead. Don't fucking do
that again.

1144
01:33:19,769 --> 01:33:22,117
LAURA: It's not like I did it on--

1145
01:33:22,117 --> 01:33:25,583
LIAM: Don't fucking do that again, all right? Just
don't fucking do it again.

1146
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,330
LAURA: All right.

1147
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:28,222
LIAM: Fuck.

1148
01:33:28,222 --> 01:33:30,854
LAURA: I can't breathe. You're about to kill me
again.

1149
01:33:30,854 --> 01:33:35,385
LIAM: You'll live, you'll live. Jesus. Whoever
that is.

1150
01:33:35,385 --> 01:33:49,069
LAURA: So-- (laughs) I heard a rumor that you sort
of saved my life in a really creepy sort of way. I

1151
01:33:49,069 --> 01:33:58,738
talk to people. I talk to so many people. I find
out things. Secrets aren't safe when Vex is around.

1152
01:33:58,738 --> 01:34:02,611
LIAM: Is there any coffee in this fucking castle?

1153
01:34:02,611 --> 01:34:06,497
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, I have a present for you,
because I feel like you're going to really like

1154
01:34:06,497 --> 01:34:10,974
it. Would you like it?

1155
01:34:10,974 --> 01:34:14,926
LIAM: That's random. All right.

1156
01:34:14,926 --> 01:34:34,179
LAURA: I have this armor that I think would be
really great on you. Do you want it? It's really

1157
01:34:34,179 --> 01:34:37,548
expensive. If you don't take it quickly, I might
change my mi--

1158
01:34:37,548 --> 01:34:39,527
LIAM: I don't want it.

1159
01:34:39,527 --> 01:34:43,983
LAURA: Oh, that was expensive cardstock.

1160
01:34:43,983 --> 01:34:46,497
(laughter)

1161
01:34:46,497 --> 01:34:51,505
LIAM: I'll give you the leather armor after I have
a chance to change.

1162
01:34:51,505 --> 01:34:58,615
LAURA: All right. I love you.

1163
01:34:58,615 --> 01:35:03,190
LIAM: (softly) I know. I know.

1164
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:04,756
LAURA: Let's get breakfast.

1165
01:35:04,756 --> 01:35:06,167
LIAM: Yeah.

1166
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:10,087
MATT: From that point, the smell of coffee begins
to fill the air from the inside of the Whitestone

1167
01:35:10,087 --> 01:35:16,642
castle halls. The servants have prepared
breakfast, and a meal is ready for you. Grog

1168
01:35:16,642 --> 01:35:22,814
jumping to attention as the scent reaches your
nose. The rest of you all slowly find your way

1169
01:35:22,814 --> 01:35:24,247
back down. You eat--

1170
01:35:24,247 --> 01:35:28,339
MARISHA: Do we come out and see Vax in the
armor?

1171
01:35:28,339 --> 01:35:31,106
MATT: Are you putting on the armor?

1172
01:35:31,106 --> 01:35:33,017
LIAM: I'm just looking at it in the hallway.

1173
01:35:33,017 --> 01:35:37,829
MARISHA: So I guess I step out and see him looking
at it in the hallway.

1174
01:35:37,829 --> 01:35:40,617
LIAM: Still pretty tired, to be honest. Didn't
sleep a lot in the doorway.

1175
01:35:40,617 --> 01:35:44,776
MATT: Yeah. Some of you guys step out, and you see
Vax standing in the hallway, clutching in his

1176
01:35:44,776 --> 01:35:50,480
hands, looking over all the various, like,
pushed-in, engraved runes across the leatherwork,

1177
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:55,826
the raven feathers that adorn the bottom of the
mantle.

1178
01:35:55,826 --> 01:36:02,340
LAURA: Careful, it smells a lot like must and mold
and birds.

1179
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:14,499
MARISHA: I walk by and... briefly lock eyes and
keep going without saying anything.

1180
01:36:14,499 --> 01:36:15,787
MATT: Okay.

1181
01:36:15,787 --> 01:36:18,541
TRAVIS: Oh shit, you got the armor now?

1182
01:36:18,541 --> 01:36:22,724
LAURA: He stole it, what can I say? He is a really
sneaky, stealthy kind of guy.

1183
01:36:22,724 --> 01:36:24,253
TRAVIS: Nice.

1184
01:36:24,253 --> 01:36:26,114
LAURA: Yeah. Fair and square.

1185
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:30,446
LIAM: I just took it for fashion purposes, I suppose.

1186
01:36:30,446 --> 01:36:32,504
TRAVIS: Oh, you need all the help you can get.

1187
01:36:32,504 --> 01:36:33,632
LIAM: Yeah.

1188
01:36:33,632 --> 01:36:38,369
SAM: Should we go out in the woods and unleash an
undead beast that will kill us all?

1189
01:36:38,369 --> 01:36:42,641
TRAVIS: Yes! Christmas morning! Who has that, by
the way?

1190
01:36:42,641 --> 01:36:43,562
SAM: I do.

1191
01:36:43,562 --> 01:36:44,665
TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah!

1192
01:36:44,665 --> 01:36:45,896
SAM: Don't worry, it's safe.

1193
01:36:45,896 --> 01:36:47,308
TRAVIS: Where d'you keep it?

1194
01:36:47,308 --> 01:36:52,941
SAM: Oh! Hold on-- Got a pouch or some-- you know
what? It's back in my room.

1195
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:58,524
MATT: All right. You go retrieve it.

1196
01:36:58,524 --> 01:37:00,899
SAM: Got it!

1197
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:01,977
TRAVIS: Where's Percy?

1198
01:37:01,977 --> 01:37:07,000
LAURA: Where's Pike? We should bring her with us.
Can we bring Pike with us? I know she's taking

1199
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,596
care of Gilmore, but.

1200
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:13,038
SAM: Mm, that's possibly more important. I think
this thing'll be fine!

1201
01:37:13,038 --> 01:37:17,751
LAURA: We need some sort of somebody that can
heal, I think we've learned this for ourselves.

1202
01:37:17,751 --> 01:37:18,932
SAM: I can heal!

1203
01:37:18,932 --> 01:37:22,981
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got potions, we're fine. It's
probably, like, a big Saint Bernard. What's the

1204
01:37:22,981 --> 01:37:23,889
big deal?

1205
01:37:23,889 --> 01:37:28,978
LAURA: (sighs) Okay. We learn nothing, carry on.

1206
01:37:28,978 --> 01:37:30,298
TRAVIS: Where's Percy?

1207
01:37:30,298 --> 01:37:31,652
TALIESIN: I'm right here.

1208
01:37:31,652 --> 01:37:34,019
TRAVIS: Oh! Shit, you were quiet. Hello.

1209
01:37:34,019 --> 01:37:35,695
TALIESIN: (coughs) Hello. Good morning.

1210
01:37:35,695 --> 01:37:37,603
TRAVIS: Need any coffee? An enema?

1211
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:39,179
TALIESIN: What?

1212
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:40,512
MARISHA: A coffee enema?

1213
01:37:40,512 --> 01:37:43,446
TALIESIN: What!? No. I'm fine. Good morning.

1214
01:37:43,446 --> 01:37:45,323
LIAM: I'm going to walk off with this shit.

1215
01:37:45,323 --> 01:37:46,416
MATT: Okay.

1216
01:37:46,416 --> 01:37:53,326
TRAVIS: And we go outside with the necklace.

1217
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:54,754
SAM: Yeah, where're we headed?

1218
01:37:54,754 --> 01:37:55,761
TRAVIS: The woods!

1219
01:37:55,761 --> 01:37:57,589
LAURA: No. The caves. I thought we were going to
the--

1220
01:37:57,589 --> 01:38:00,010
MARISHA: Going to the caves on the edge of the
woods.

1221
01:38:00,010 --> 01:38:01,754
MATT: Yeah. It's the caves that are--

1222
01:38:01,754 --> 01:38:03,131
MARISHA: Going to go through the woods.

1223
01:38:03,131 --> 01:38:06,148
LIAM: (sings) Into the woods!

1224
01:38:06,148 --> 01:38:13,707
MATT: So. You all gather together and make your
way northwest of Whitestone, towards where you

1225
01:38:13,707 --> 01:38:19,242
found the stone giant fortress and the series of
caves that are in the mountain behind it. You get

1226
01:38:19,242 --> 01:38:25,795
there; it's still seemingly abandoned. You case
the area for a while. No noticeable movement other

1227
01:38:25,795 --> 01:38:28,743
than a few woodland entities that exist in that
vicinity.

1228
01:38:28,743 --> 01:38:33,249
LAURA: Primeval Awareness! (radar sounds)

1229
01:38:33,249 --> 01:38:36,830
MATT: Okay. That is now the sound it makes every
time you do it.

1230
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:37,898
LAURA: I like it.

1231
01:38:37,898 --> 01:38:43,167
MATT: Yeah, so hold onto that one. I'll make that
a new ringtone sound for you guys. What are you

1232
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,299
looking for?

1233
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:45,999
LAURA: Oh, there's so many things I could sense!

1234
01:38:45,999 --> 01:38:47,235
MATT: Yeah.

1235
01:38:47,235 --> 01:38:49,304
TRAVIS: What about sirens?

1236
01:38:49,304 --> 01:38:50,515
LAURA: Sirens?

1237
01:38:50,515 --> 01:38:54,254
TRAVIS: Wait, what are those things called? The
things that took our horses the last time we were here?

1238
01:38:54,254 --> 01:38:55,241
MATT: Harpies?

1239
01:38:55,241 --> 01:38:56,505
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

1240
01:38:56,505 --> 01:38:58,685
LAURA: Sure! Harpies.

1241
01:38:58,685 --> 01:38:59,945
MATT: For how many miles is it?

1242
01:38:59,945 --> 01:39:01,066
LAURA: Six miles!

1243
01:39:01,066 --> 01:39:05,164
MATT: Six miles? Yeah, there's a few blips on the
far, far western side of here. You get the essence

1244
01:39:05,164 --> 01:39:09,896
way off in the mountains, there's maybe a small
nest. Nothing that's immediately dangerous.

1245
01:39:09,896 --> 01:39:13,442
LAURA: What about if I sit for one more minute and
I think if I can sense any giants.

1246
01:39:13,442 --> 01:39:23,298
MATT: You do, to the far, far north. You get the
sense that there is some sort of giant-based

1247
01:39:23,298 --> 01:39:27,347
lifeform maybe two, three miles north of you.

1248
01:39:27,347 --> 01:39:28,497
LAURA: Okay.

1249
01:39:28,497 --> 01:39:29,589
TRAVIS: How's it look?

1250
01:39:29,589 --> 01:39:33,015
LAURA: Well, I mean, clear of the things I checked
for. No giants.

1251
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:35,296
TRAVIS: Sweet! Let's go! Up to the cave!

1252
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,597
MATT: All right. So the fortress or the caves
behind it?

1253
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:39,962
TRAVIS: Fortress or cave?

1254
01:39:39,962 --> 01:39:41,998
LAURA: Were they both empty? I don't remember.

1255
01:39:41,998 --> 01:39:44,206
TALIESIN: Everything was empty, if I recall.

1256
01:39:44,206 --> 01:39:47,585
TRAVIS: Yeah. Small space.

1257
01:39:47,585 --> 01:39:48,993
TALIESIN: Let's do the caves.

1258
01:39:48,993 --> 01:39:51,186
LAURA: All right, sure. Cave.

1259
01:39:51,186 --> 01:39:52,394
TRAVIS: Yeah. Cave.

1260
01:39:52,394 --> 01:39:53,516
MATT: All right.

1261
01:39:53,516 --> 01:39:59,896
LAURA: Oh, if we stick to the woods, it's my
favored terrain. If we go into a cave, not as much.

1262
01:39:59,896 --> 01:40:06,663
SAM: The caves would contain it. It can't fly away
or anything.

1263
01:40:06,663 --> 01:40:09,356
TRAVIS: So is it like, cave-fortress, are they
same level? I can't remember.

1264
01:40:09,356 --> 01:40:11,971
MATT: It's a pathway that leads up into a small
ravine in the mountain pass where you guys

1265
01:40:11,971 --> 01:40:16,781
originally walked down into Whitestone. Up against
the north side of where the mountain meets that

1266
01:40:16,781 --> 01:40:20,639
ravine, there's a big stone fortress that is built
into the side of the mountain, and then around

1267
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,303
that are a series of smaller caves.

1268
01:40:22,303 --> 01:40:24,433
LIAM: (singing) Anything can happen in the woods.

1269
01:40:24,433 --> 01:40:27,006
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to this fortress, then we
got more room to move in case it does suck.

1270
01:40:27,006 --> 01:40:28,505
SAM: All right, fine, fortress.

1271
01:40:28,505 --> 01:40:33,708
MATT: You guys find your way inside, the cold
morning air still has encompassed the stone floor

1272
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:42,531
itself, you can see there are still the scattered
and slowly decomposing bits of meat and flesh in

1273
01:40:42,531 --> 01:40:46,209
the far corner, you still see the splatters of blood
that have turned black and cracked as it dried. No

1274
01:40:46,209 --> 01:40:53,036
corpses here, as the corpses were retooled by the
Briarwoods while they were in control. The

1275
01:40:53,036 --> 01:40:56,168
fortress other than that is still empty, and
seemingly untouched since you last left it.

1276
01:40:56,168 --> 01:40:59,828
SAM: All right, well, I'm just going to do it then!

1277
01:40:59,828 --> 01:41:03,244
LAURA and MARISHA: Wait wait wait!

1278
01:41:03,244 --> 01:41:06,738
MARISHA: Wait, there's doors open to the cave,
right?

1279
01:41:06,738 --> 01:41:09,331
SAM and TALIESIN: We're in a fortress.

1280
01:41:09,331 --> 01:41:10,885
MARISHA: Fortress. Whatever.

1281
01:41:10,885 --> 01:41:13,566
MATT: (laughs) Coffee's just starting to kick in
for you guys.

1282
01:41:13,566 --> 01:41:22,051
LAURA: Just barely! Do we have any buff spells or
some shit that we should cast, to make us cooler?

1283
01:41:22,051 --> 01:41:23,858
MARISHA: Should I throw a wall up?

1284
01:41:23,858 --> 01:41:25,105
SAM: A wall for what?

1285
01:41:25,105 --> 01:41:26,771
MARISHA: Do I need to bar the entrance? Or are
there doors?

1286
01:41:26,771 --> 01:41:29,318
TALIESIN: Vex, by the way--

1287
01:41:29,318 --> 01:41:31,452
MATT: There are doors, but they're partially ajar
where you left them.

1288
01:41:31,452 --> 01:41:33,525
LAURA: Aww, put it on, it's useful!

1289
01:41:33,525 --> 01:41:35,641
LIAM: No. We're not having this conversation.

1290
01:41:35,641 --> 01:41:37,996
TALIESIN: Vex, by the way, I've got something for
you.

1291
01:41:37,996 --> 01:41:39,112
LAURA: What? Yes, dear?

1292
01:41:39,112 --> 01:41:40,368
TALIESIN: And I pull out the arrow.

1293
01:41:40,368 --> 01:41:42,433
LAURA: What is this?

1294
01:41:42,433 --> 01:41:49,987
TALIESIN: This is an evening of unbridled guilt.
Come here, let me show you. In theory, this is a

1295
01:41:49,987 --> 01:41:51,626
siege arrow.

1296
01:41:51,626 --> 01:41:52,959
LAURA: Okay.

1297
01:41:52,959 --> 01:41:57,666
TALIESIN: Shattering stone, shattering doors,
breaking things that should not be broken.

1298
01:41:57,666 --> 01:41:59,498
LAURA: Breaking hearts left and right?

1299
01:41:59,498 --> 01:42:06,169
TALIESIN: If that is what you're after. It should
work! Never forget you're my favorite,

1300
01:42:06,169 --> 01:42:07,938
and I'm so sorry.

1301
01:42:07,938 --> 01:42:11,570
LAURA: I kiss him on the cheek. Thank you, Percy.

1302
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:13,683
TALIESIN: That was much nicer than your brother.

1303
01:42:13,683 --> 01:42:16,372
LAURA: Is that a black eye?

1304
01:42:16,372 --> 01:42:18,874
TALIESIN: (stammering) I didn't sleep.

1305
01:42:18,874 --> 01:42:22,167
LAURA: Huh. This is lovely, I can't wait to use
it.

1306
01:42:22,167 --> 01:42:24,021
TALIESIN: There'll be more.

1307
01:42:24,021 --> 01:42:27,004
SAM: All right, in three, two--

1308
01:42:27,004 --> 01:42:28,359
TRAVIS: Wait hold on, hold on hold on!

1309
01:42:28,359 --> 01:42:31,166
TALIESIN: In a circle! Aim it into the center of
the circle.

1310
01:42:31,166 --> 01:42:35,785
LIAM: And is it three-two-one, three-two-one-do
it, or three-two-one and go,

1311
01:42:35,785 --> 01:42:37,140
SAM: On the one. On one.

1312
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:40,258
TALIESIN: It's Jenga, one one-thousand two
one-thousand three one-thousand four

1313
01:42:40,258 --> 01:42:41,345
one-thousand.

1314
01:42:41,345 --> 01:42:46,417
SAM: Should one of us leave the room in case it
comes out and paralyzes all of us? Just going to

1315
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:48,413
throw that out there.

1316
01:42:48,413 --> 01:42:50,984
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we should, what do you call it,
spread out?

1317
01:42:50,984 --> 01:42:53,477
LAURA: Yeah, definitely, let's all surround it and
make sure we're not all clumped up.

1318
01:42:53,477 --> 01:42:55,818
TALIESIN: If only someone had armor that could
make them immune to paralysis.

1319
01:42:55,818 --> 01:43:00,937
LIAM: That's not a bad idea, you get controlled by
things. Maybe you could wait just

1320
01:43:00,937 --> 01:43:02,287
a little bit further back?

1321
01:43:02,287 --> 01:43:05,239
LAURA: This was somebody's pet, all right? It's
probably not smart enough

1322
01:43:05,239 --> 01:43:06,708
to take control of our minds.

1323
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:07,971
LIAM: That's a big if.

1324
01:43:07,971 --> 01:43:10,421
TRAVIS: I don't mind stepping out, but I would
like to be able to see.

1325
01:43:10,421 --> 01:43:11,574
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah!

1326
01:43:11,574 --> 01:43:16,425
LIAM: Yeah! We won't shut the door, I just want
you outside of any potential blast radius.

1327
01:43:16,425 --> 01:43:22,484
TALIESIN: Let's spread out in a circle; we'll let
it loose in the center, that way it can't even see

1328
01:43:22,484 --> 01:43:23,506
all of us.

1329
01:43:23,506 --> 01:43:28,516
LAURA: All right, I like it. It only gets to see
Scanlan.

1330
01:43:28,516 --> 01:43:30,001
SAM: It can see me.

1331
01:43:30,001 --> 01:43:32,218
LAURA: I'm going to stealth.

1332
01:43:32,218 --> 01:43:36,644
SAM: Well, when a thing is born, it latches on to
the first thing it sees, like its mama.

1333
01:43:36,644 --> 01:43:38,423
LIAM: Yes, we're going to hide.

1334
01:43:38,423 --> 01:43:40,594
MATT: All right, stealth check from both of you
guys?

1335
01:43:40,594 --> 01:43:42,404
MARISHA: So we're going to try and talk to it?

1336
01:43:42,404 --> 01:43:44,061
LAURA: Yeah, Scanlan's going to talk to it.

1337
01:43:44,061 --> 01:43:46,239
MARISHA: Scanlan? You prepared?

1338
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:47,465
LAURA: Natural 20!

1339
01:43:47,465 --> 01:43:51,427
TALIESIN: You just teleport, there's like a phase
effect.

1340
01:43:51,427 --> 01:43:59,117
MATT: The two of you back off and find the nearby
shaded corners, where some of the haphazardly

1341
01:43:59,117 --> 01:44:04,111
tossed hides and furs are in the corner, you
vanish behind the alcoves keeping a watch.

1342
01:44:04,111 --> 01:44:10,350
LAURA: Trinket, don't stand next to me, it gives
it away. Go stand next to Keyleth!

1343
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:12,897
TRAVIS: Is there a doorway in the fortress?

1344
01:44:12,897 --> 01:44:15,249
MATT: Yeah, there's the main doorway you guys
entered, which is two--

1345
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:16,820
TRAVIS: Can I stand in that, then?

1346
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:20,200
MATT: Sure, you stand there, in the entranceway
that's pushed open, which is wide enough for a

1347
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,703
giant to push through. You got a little bit of room to
each side, but you're there.

1348
01:44:23,703 --> 01:44:27,112
TRAVIS: Vax, is this g-- Vax?

1349
01:44:27,112 --> 01:44:28,741
TALIESIN: It's fine, you're fine.

1350
01:44:28,741 --> 01:44:29,992
SAM: Here we go, guys.

1351
01:44:29,992 --> 01:44:37,705
MARISHA: So, those two are stealthed-- I'm at
Scanlan's left shoulder, back a bit.

1352
01:44:37,705 --> 01:44:39,207
LAURA: And Trinket's next to you!

1353
01:44:39,207 --> 01:44:41,712
MARISHA: And Trinket's next to me. I'm rolling
with Trinket.

1354
01:44:41,712 --> 01:44:46,258
TALIESIN: I've got a little bit of distance, yes,
that's good.

1355
01:44:46,258 --> 01:44:50,109
MATT: All righty, and there's Percy here, and
Travis is off this way. Good to know.

1356
01:44:50,109 --> 01:44:57,649
SAM: I don't know how to use this thing.

1357
01:44:57,649 --> 01:45:00,403
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't know how to use it.

1358
01:45:00,403 --> 01:45:08,601
SAM: By the power of Raven's Slumber, I command
thee: (yells) awaken! Beast! Cruel or otherwise!

1359
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:14,000
Face your new master, and know his name is
Scanlan!

1360
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,909
(laughter)

1361
01:45:15,909 --> 01:45:19,427
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh, holy shit! Never could've
been better.

1362
01:45:19,427 --> 01:45:26,199
MATT: As you spend your bonus action to release
the gate hold on the crystal, you guys see as he

1363
01:45:26,199 --> 01:45:31,252
thrusts his hands forward, there's a burst of
shadow energy that, almost like someone throwing a

1364
01:45:31,252 --> 01:45:37,222
big pot of water, this blackness goes out of it,
and then as it hits the ground, it spills into

1365
01:45:37,222 --> 01:45:45,142
smoke on the ground, and as that dark form stops,
it is in the form of an about

1366
01:45:45,142 --> 01:45:55,253
waist-to-lower-torso-height creature. As the form
coalesces into its normal self, you can see before

1367
01:45:55,253 --> 01:46:05,606
you, shaking its head, a rather large, dark grey
and black wolf. (growls, snarls)

1368
01:46:05,606 --> 01:46:08,486
SAM: Easy, easy.

1369
01:46:08,486 --> 01:46:09,949
TRAVIS: Told you it was a dog.

1370
01:46:09,949 --> 01:46:16,356
SAM: Garlic? Galdric, Galdric, easy, Galdric.
Easy. We're friends. Here.

1371
01:46:16,356 --> 01:46:20,126
MATT: He's backing up a little bit, snarling. You
see Trinket starts growling, (growls).

1372
01:46:20,126 --> 01:46:21,787
LAURA: Trinket, be nice-- oh!

1373
01:46:21,787 --> 01:46:25,229
MATT: As you say that (snarls) it looks over at
you in the far corner.

1374
01:46:25,229 --> 01:46:28,430
LAURA: (whispers) I'm natural 20! That still
didn't see me!

1375
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:35,463
MARISHA: I pet Trinket, like, 'Chill, chill, be
cool'.

1376
01:46:35,463 --> 01:46:44,943
MATT: Trinket backs up a little bit, but still
locking eyes. You can see this wolf now, its gums

1377
01:46:44,943 --> 01:46:51,447
and teeth are bared, its fur is all puffed up, its
tail is-- it's definitely holding its ground and

1378
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:53,639
trying to make itself look as intimidating as
possible.

1379
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:55,427
SAM: Is it a small beast?

1380
01:46:55,427 --> 01:47:00,668
MATT: This would be, technically, borderline
medium. This'd be medium, technically.

1381
01:47:00,668 --> 01:47:03,467
SAM: I can only speak with small beasts.

1382
01:47:03,467 --> 01:47:05,965
MARISHA: Wait, use Speak with Animals?

1383
01:47:05,965 --> 01:47:10,001
LIAM: (laughs) She swatted me and said, 'Put your
armor on,' so I'm doing it.

1384
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:11,829
MATT: Okay. That'll take you about 15 minutes.

1385
01:47:11,829 --> 01:47:12,698
LAURA: Aw.

1386
01:47:12,698 --> 01:47:14,316
LIAM: 15 minutes! Well, guess I'm doing it.

1387
01:47:14,316 --> 01:47:18,426
MATT: All right. You don't just slip on leather
armor. (chuckles)

1388
01:47:18,426 --> 01:47:20,465
LIAM: No, I get that, I get that, I would've
guessed two minutes.

1389
01:47:20,465 --> 01:47:26,360
TRAVIS: Can somebody check to see if it's actually
a wolf or just looks like one? Like, check it?

1390
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,619
LAURA: Can I use my perception?

1391
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:32,432
MATT: You're a bit far away from it right now. You
can try to get closer if you want.

1392
01:47:32,432 --> 01:47:33,776
LAURA: Can I sneak?

1393
01:47:33,776 --> 01:47:35,507
MATT: Yeah, make another stealth check.

1394
01:47:35,507 --> 01:47:39,281
LAURA: I do get advantage, because of my cloak.
Sweet.

1395
01:47:39,281 --> 01:47:41,444
LIAM: You should yell out, 'I'm stealthing'.

1396
01:47:41,444 --> 01:47:47,359
LAURA: I'm stealthing! Damn it. 19?

1397
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:52,754
MATT: Okay. As you begin making your way forward,
it doesn't seem to notice you.

1398
01:47:52,754 --> 01:47:53,991
LAURA: Hey, it doesn't?

1399
01:47:53,991 --> 01:47:54,867
MATT: No.

1400
01:47:54,867 --> 01:47:56,771
LAURA: Can I see it better now to perceive it?

1401
01:47:56,771 --> 01:48:01,004
MATT: Looking right at it, and from your
experience in the wild as well, and Keyleth,

1402
01:48:01,004 --> 01:48:09,022
you're getting it, this does not appear to
be anything beyond a large wolf.

1403
01:48:09,156 --> 01:48:16,977
TALIESIN: I'm going to get on my knees and put out
my hand and call it.

1404
01:48:16,977 --> 01:48:19,527
Galdric, Galdric.

1405
01:48:19,527 --> 01:48:22,715
MATT: Go ahead and make an animal handling check.

1406
01:48:22,715 --> 01:48:24,977
SAM: Animal handling! We've never done that
before!

1407
01:48:24,977 --> 01:48:27,384
LAURA: If I help my brother get on the armor, will
it happen faster?

1408
01:48:27,384 --> 01:48:28,238
MATT: Probably.

1409
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:29,521
LAURA: I help him put on the armor.

1410
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:30,471
MATT: Okay.

1411
01:48:30,471 --> 01:48:32,717
LIAM: (whispering) Ow ow ow! That's too tight!

1412
01:48:32,717 --> 01:48:34,640
LAURA: Well, you're not the same size as the other
guy!

1413
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:40,096
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a little bit better. Ten.

1414
01:48:40,096 --> 01:48:44,545
MATT: Ten. As you put out your hand, Galdric
snarls, and as you say, "Here, boy."

1415
01:48:44,545 --> 01:48:48,990
(growls and snaps) It lashes out at your hand.

1416
01:48:48,990 --> 01:48:53,256
That is going to be-- That's a 21 to hit?

1417
01:48:53,256 --> 01:48:58,165
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

1418
01:48:58,165 --> 01:49:01,204
TRAVIS: Keyleth, can't you talk to, like, plants
and shit?

1419
01:49:01,204 --> 01:49:05,032
MATT: You take six points of piercing damage as
its jaws clench down on your hand, and you tear

1420
01:49:05,032 --> 01:49:07,863
your hand away. You can feel the warmth flowing
under the glove.

1421
01:49:07,863 --> 01:49:09,581
TALIESIN: Gently, I'm gentle with it.

1422
01:49:09,581 --> 01:49:11,115
MARISHA: I cast Speak with Animals.

1423
01:49:11,115 --> 01:49:14,712
LIAM: I click my Boots of Haste!

1424
01:49:14,712 --> 01:49:16,138
MATT: You do?

1425
01:49:16,138 --> 01:49:17,627
SAM: Aren't you getting dressed?

1426
01:49:17,627 --> 01:49:18,979
LAURA: He can dress faster!

1427
01:49:18,979 --> 01:49:21,072
TRAVIS: Speed change.

1428
01:49:21,072 --> 01:49:22,336
MATT: All right.

1429
01:49:22,336 --> 01:49:23,349
TRAVIS: Quick change.

1430
01:49:23,349 --> 01:49:24,513
SAM: Seven-and-a-half minutes!

1431
01:49:24,513 --> 01:49:26,244
(laughter)

1432
01:49:26,244 --> 01:49:30,457
MATT: You guys all become immediately aware of the
creaking of leather in the distance as the two

1433
01:49:30,457 --> 01:49:32,917
siblings are in the process of fast-changing one
of the other.

1434
01:49:32,917 --> 01:49:34,428
LAURA: The rustle of feathers.

1435
01:49:34,428 --> 01:49:44,776
MARISHA: Okay, I cast Speak with Animals. And I
crouch down to the ground. And bow down a little

1436
01:49:44,776 --> 01:49:49,366
bit, and I say: are you the one they call
Galdric?

1437
01:49:49,366 --> 01:49:56,702
MATT: Looks over at you for a second. The growl
stops, and its posture changes a little bit. It

1438
01:49:56,702 --> 01:49:58,433
raises its nose. (sniffs)

1439
01:49:58,433 --> 01:50:00,811
MARISHA: Was Purvan your master?

1440
01:50:00,811 --> 01:50:06,055
MATT: Looking at you as you guys hear Keyleth
making this series of growling sounds.

1441
01:50:06,055 --> 01:50:08,257
LAURA: Trinket totally understands you, no?

1442
01:50:08,257 --> 01:50:11,744
MATT: Strangely enough, Trinket does, Trinket's
like, (confused bear noise).

1443
01:50:11,744 --> 01:50:15,027
TALIESIN: Trinket is Scooby-Doo, apparently.

1444
01:50:15,027 --> 01:50:19,398
TRAVIS: Shitballs! Taint! You going that way?

1445
01:50:19,398 --> 01:50:20,882
MARISHA: Oh my god, I get a secret!

1446
01:50:20,882 --> 01:50:29,074
SAM: There are several items that are sold out at
the store! If you'd like to go on and see what

1447
01:50:29,074 --> 01:50:32,898
items have already sold out, check it out.
(laughs)

1448
01:50:32,898 --> 01:50:35,422
LAURA: We need to get more t-shirts in stock.

1449
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:38,760
SAM: Yeah, we know that. We know that, guys. We
know.

1450
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:46,549
LAURA: That needs to happen. But there is still
the Critical Role logo t-shirt available. What is

1451
01:50:46,549 --> 01:50:48,154
happening? What is he--

1452
01:50:48,154 --> 01:50:49,705
SAM: Is there a ring or something?

1453
01:50:49,705 --> 01:50:50,974
LAURA: Is the ring still available?

1454
01:50:50,974 --> 01:50:51,782
SAM: I don't know.

1455
01:50:51,782 --> 01:50:53,764
LAURA: If the ring is still available, check out
our ring!

1456
01:50:53,764 --> 01:51:07,867
MARISHA: I can respond back, right? Your master
died a great champion for the Raven Queen. He has

1457
01:51:07,867 --> 01:51:17,365
been paid a great honor, and now the Raven Queen
has chosen a new master.

1458
01:51:17,365 --> 01:51:19,518
LAURA: I push Vax forward.

1459
01:51:19,518 --> 01:51:25,243
MATT: You've gotten maybe part of the tunic on.

1460
01:51:25,243 --> 01:51:27,518
(laughter)

1461
01:51:27,518 --> 01:51:30,271
SAM: Is he Donald-Duck-ing it right now?

1462
01:51:30,271 --> 01:51:37,833
MATT: Practically. There are undergarments, but
not much. It's, like, bare legs and knees, part of

1463
01:51:37,833 --> 01:51:44,755
an arm. Yeah, he got thrust out of the changing
room about 20 seconds into it.

1464
01:51:44,755 --> 01:51:46,419
SAM: Nice.

1465
01:51:46,419 --> 01:51:50,039
LIAM: I still walk toward the wolf.

1466
01:51:50,039 --> 01:51:51,527
TALIESIN: Waddle.

1467
01:51:51,527 --> 01:51:54,728
LIAM: No no no, I did the top, I did the top,
c'mon!

1468
01:51:54,728 --> 01:51:57,604
MATT: The wolf turns his head a little bit
curiously.

1469
01:51:57,604 --> 01:51:59,759
MARISHA: I continue to speak to the wolf.

1470
01:51:59,759 --> 01:52:03,842
LIAM: And I kneel. And bow my head.

1471
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:17,106
MARISHA: A great darkness has fallen upon our
lands. Upon Othanzia. We could use all of the

1472
01:52:17,106 --> 01:52:29,359
assistance that we can achieve. Would you be
willing to find a new purpose? Join Vax'ildan--

1473
01:52:29,359 --> 01:52:33,319
LIAM: Keyleth?

1474
01:52:33,319 --> 01:52:35,088
MARISHA: Yes?

1475
01:52:35,088 --> 01:52:40,233
LIAM: Tell him to come forward and look into my
eyes.

1476
01:52:40,233 --> 01:52:42,205
LAURA: (whispers) That's a bad idea for dogs.

1477
01:52:42,205 --> 01:52:43,645
LIAM: Tell him.

1478
01:52:43,645 --> 01:52:47,416
LAURA: (whispers) It's gonna bite your face off.

1479
01:52:47,416 --> 01:53:00,043
MARISHA: Galdric. Please. Approach your new master
and look into his eyes.

1480
01:53:00,043 --> 01:53:02,181
LAURA: Give him some chocolate, man!

1481
01:53:02,181 --> 01:53:08,630
MATT: The wolf looks towards you, looks towards
the loosely half-dressed half-elf.

1482
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:13,526
MARISHA: Look into his eyes. I said look into his
eyes. And see the touch of the Raven Queen inside

1483
01:53:13,526 --> 01:53:14,489
of him.

1484
01:53:14,489 --> 01:53:21,797
MATT: Wolf slowly stalks towards you across the
stone floor. You can hear the claws of the wolf

1485
01:53:21,797 --> 01:53:27,998
clattering against the stonework. As you can see
it's partially, like, digging into the stonework

1486
01:53:27,998 --> 01:53:30,534
with each step. It has purpose with each stride.

1487
01:53:30,534 --> 01:53:34,107
LIAM: As it's coming, I'm taking daggers out and
throwing 'em on the ground.

1488
01:53:34,107 --> 01:53:52,326
MATT: The wolf stops and looks up at you. Turns
around and walks towards the doorway where you are.

1489
01:53:52,326 --> 01:53:55,141
SAM: Where who is?

1490
01:53:55,141 --> 01:53:59,545
MATT: Where Grog is. Grog, who's now at the door,
at the exit.

1491
01:53:59,545 --> 01:54:01,264
LAURA: (whispers) What's his name?

1492
01:54:01,264 --> 01:54:02,819
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Galdric.

1493
01:54:02,819 --> 01:54:07,335
MARISHA: Galdric!

1494
01:54:07,335 --> 01:54:10,147
MATT: Keeps walking.

1495
01:54:10,147 --> 01:54:11,944
LAURA: Galdric!

1496
01:54:11,944 --> 01:54:13,664
SAM: Going to stop him, Grog?

1497
01:54:13,664 --> 01:54:14,852
TRAVIS: Well, I'm in the doorway.

1498
01:54:14,852 --> 01:54:21,512
MARISHA: Grog, don't move. Don't move. Look at the
dog. Don't move, and don't hurt the dog. Please

1499
01:54:21,512 --> 01:54:22,821
just look at the dog.

1500
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:24,898
LAURA: I pull out one of my treats I have for
Trinket.

1501
01:54:24,898 --> 01:54:28,088
MATT: Okay. Trinket starts lumbering up towards
you (thudding).

1502
01:54:28,088 --> 01:54:32,503
LAURA: Wait, wait, Trinket-- This is for your
buddy Galdric. Galdric!

1503
01:54:32,503 --> 01:54:36,302
MATT: Just keeps walking, doesn't even look at you
in the face, walks--

1504
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:37,980
LAURA: I throw the treat and say, hey!

1505
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:44,440
MATT: It scatters across the stone. Walks between
your legs and exits out.

1506
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,901
TRAVIS: I pivot on my back foot. I take out Craven
Edge--

1507
01:54:47,901 --> 01:54:49,000
TALIESIN: No!

1508
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:54,523
TRAVIS: No, I do, I take out Craven Edge and I
sink it into the earth right beside his head. And

1509
01:54:54,523 --> 01:54:57,531
I say, (shouts) heel!

1510
01:54:57,531 --> 01:55:01,369
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

1511
01:55:01,369 --> 01:55:04,722
LAURA: Whoa, is it good, is it good?

1512
01:55:04,722 --> 01:55:07,256
TRAVIS: 20.

1513
01:55:07,256 --> 01:55:16,888
MATT: As the sword (crack) into the rock outside
of this fortress, it probably embeds itself a good

1514
01:55:16,888 --> 01:55:23,528
foot and a half into the mountain. You guys all
hear Grog's shout echo through the inside of the

1515
01:55:23,528 --> 01:55:31,036
fortress itself, causing little bits of dust and
small pebbles to dislodge from the roof, slowly

1516
01:55:31,036 --> 01:55:37,531
fall down. The wolf has stopped and spun in its
place and reached out and lashed the blade with

1517
01:55:37,531 --> 01:55:41,829
its jaws and (cling) as it releases it.

1518
01:55:41,829 --> 01:55:56,746
TRAVIS: Stay.

1519
01:55:56,746 --> 01:55:58,972
MATT: He sits.

1520
01:55:58,972 --> 01:56:02,434
TRAVIS: That went well!

1521
01:56:02,434 --> 01:56:05,987
(laughter)

1522
01:56:05,987 --> 01:56:08,007
SAM: Dog whisperer!

1523
01:56:08,007 --> 01:56:09,490
TRAVIS: Good pup.

1524
01:56:09,490 --> 01:56:12,219
SAM: Are you its master now?

1525
01:56:12,219 --> 01:56:21,587
TRAVIS: No, no, I don't think it has a master.
This is a very powerful beast. But it needs a firm

1526
01:56:21,587 --> 01:56:35,025
hand. And I think it needs a job. So. What do we
plan to do with Galdric? Said his name right?

1527
01:56:35,025 --> 01:56:36,200
SAM: Yeah.

1528
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,906
LAURA: We plan on having him help us kill some
dragons?

1529
01:56:38,906 --> 01:56:43,218
TALIESIN: I think he's a wolf. I think perhaps
something a little less ambitious.

1530
01:56:43,218 --> 01:56:48,351
LAURA: Trinket hides very well when dragons are
around.

1531
01:56:48,351 --> 01:56:57,803
TALIESIN: I think, perhaps, joining the Whitestone
conclave might be a-- Having him

1532
01:56:57,803 --> 01:56:59,630
guard Whitestone, perhaps.

1533
01:56:59,630 --> 01:57:01,742
LAURA: Good, yeah! I like it!

1534
01:57:01,742 --> 01:57:09,594
TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull
out one thing of dry food rations, and a probably

1535
01:57:09,594 --> 01:57:13,151
pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain.

1536
01:57:13,151 --> 01:57:16,683
LIAM: Where did we get that?

1537
01:57:16,683 --> 01:57:20,069
TRAVIS: Oh, there's a veritable Walmart of shit in
this bag.

1538
01:57:20,069 --> 01:57:22,058
(laughter)

1539
01:57:22,058 --> 01:57:25,672
TRAVIS: And I, like a hamburger patty, smash it
all together.

1540
01:57:25,672 --> 01:57:31,664
MATT: The only reason you even know this was at
one point dark elf brain matter is because that's

1541
01:57:31,664 --> 01:57:38,121
what you willed to reach in and find. It does not
at all visually match your memory of its--

1542
01:57:38,121 --> 01:57:41,069
TRAVIS: Does it have a little bit of a viscous-y
ooze, mostly?

1543
01:57:41,069 --> 01:57:42,475
MATT: Oh yeah, no, it's--

1544
01:57:42,475 --> 01:57:44,342
TRAVIS: It'll soften up the dry food.

1545
01:57:44,342 --> 01:57:45,475
LIAM: Gray Chicken McNuggets.

1546
01:57:45,475 --> 01:57:48,211
MATT: It'll soften up a lot of things. It's pretty
terrifying.

1547
01:57:48,211 --> 01:57:49,505
LAURA: It'll make the wolf vomit.

1548
01:57:49,505 --> 01:57:53,999
TRAVIS: So I throw that on the ground, and I pour
a little ale on top of it.

1549
01:57:53,999 --> 01:57:55,983
(laughter)

1550
01:57:55,983 --> 01:57:57,974
SAM: Wolves love getting drunk.

1551
01:57:57,974 --> 01:58:01,688
MATT: Very good. It leans forward and smells it.

1552
01:58:01,688 --> 01:58:05,421
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, it wasn't the best, I can do
better. Okay.

1553
01:58:05,421 --> 01:58:09,358
LAURA: Trinket goes up and starts eating it.

1554
01:58:09,358 --> 01:58:12,598
TRAVIS: He's going to barf that all over the
carpet later.

1555
01:58:12,598 --> 01:58:14,880
LIAM: Forget the chocolate.

1556
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,993
TRAVIS: I need to carry beef in this bitch.

1557
01:58:16,993 --> 01:58:18,848
TALIESIN: It goes bad.

1558
01:58:18,848 --> 01:58:22,182
LIAM: We have Dork! We've got nothing of Dork
left?

1559
01:58:22,182 --> 01:58:28,788
LAURA: Oh, you know what I have, by the way? I
still have, like, a cooler Bag of Holding. That we

1560
01:58:28,788 --> 01:58:30,192
got from the Slayer's Take.

1561
01:58:30,192 --> 01:58:32,120
TRAVIS: Oh! That's really good to know.

1562
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,942
TRAVIS: I pour into a little chalice some ale.

1563
01:58:34,942 --> 01:58:40,636
LAURA: Like, it keeps things cold. Yeah, it's like
a little bitty one, but it keeps parts from going bad.

1564
01:58:40,636 --> 01:58:47,802
MATT: It's nowhere near as large as a Bag of
Holding, but it has a slow stasis for organic goods.

1565
01:58:47,802 --> 01:58:50,268
SAM: We should keep some food on hand next time!

1566
01:58:50,268 --> 01:58:51,788
LAURA: Totally!

1567
01:58:51,788 --> 01:58:56,324
TRAVIS: I offer him some ale, just to see if he
even likes it. Some dogs like beer, some others don't.

1568
01:58:56,324 --> 01:58:58,317
MATT: Mm. Wolf doesn't seem to be interested.

1569
01:58:58,317 --> 01:59:00,150
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right. Then I chug it.

1570
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:07,198
SAM: So are we telling this wolf something or
commanding it to come with us as we return to town?

1571
01:59:07,198 --> 01:59:11,452
TALIESIN: I think he would be helpful to guard the
town, at this point.

1572
01:59:11,452 --> 01:59:13,396
LAURA: Well, he'll follow Grog, I suppose.

1573
01:59:13,396 --> 01:59:15,698
SAM: Let's go back to town and bring him with us.

1574
01:59:15,698 --> 01:59:17,020
TRAVIS: All right.

1575
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:20,366
MATT: You guys return to Whitestone. It's another,
like, three-hour trek to find your way back down

1576
01:59:20,366 --> 01:59:27,855
to the city. Stalks up next to you. Definitely
seems to be attentive to your commands. Doesn't

1577
01:59:27,855 --> 01:59:33,175
appear to be a bond per se, but of everyone that
it's encountered so far, you're the only one that

1578
01:59:33,175 --> 01:59:35,458
really gathered its respect.

1579
01:59:35,458 --> 01:59:38,401
LAURA: I threw a treat at it. I don't understand.

1580
01:59:38,401 --> 01:59:41,588
TRAVIS: That's a great thing to throw at a giant
400-pound bull mastiff.

1581
01:59:41,588 --> 01:59:47,358
MARISHA: I spoke words at it. Apparently that's
not good enough. Communicating.

1582
01:59:47,358 --> 01:59:51,860
TRAVIS: Right, so we're walking back to town.
We've got a giant fuck-off wolf with us.

1583
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:54,845
Vax looks like Edward Scissorhands.

1584
01:59:54,845 --> 01:59:57,414
LIAM: I'm peeling that off as we walk.

1585
01:59:57,414 --> 01:59:58,451
LAURA and TRAVIS: What?

1586
01:59:58,451 --> 01:59:59,334
TRAVIS: No!

1587
01:59:59,334 --> 02:00:00,430
LAURA: Leave it the fuck on!

1588
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:01,327
LIAM: I'm peeling it off.

1589
02:00:01,327 --> 02:00:03,055
LAURA: It's really expensive. What, do you want to
damage it?

1590
02:00:03,055 --> 02:00:04,869
LIAM: I'm peeling it off.

1591
02:00:04,869 --> 02:00:07,663
LAURA: (quietly) Fuck, he doesn't appreciate
presents.

1592
02:00:07,663 --> 02:00:12,234
MATT: All right, so you take what little bit of
the armor you had on, off, and are you putting

1593
02:00:12,234 --> 02:00:13,740
your other armor back on?

1594
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:15,562
LAURA: He doesn't have any other armor. I took his
armor.

1595
02:00:15,695 --> 02:00:19,730
LIAM: I have regular fucking armor that I grew up
in with you, you fucking shit.

1596
02:00:19,730 --> 02:00:24,504
SAM: Do you want to trade with me, Vax? I've got
some armor you could take.

1597
02:00:24,504 --> 02:00:26,213
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1598
02:00:26,213 --> 02:00:27,735
LIAM: You're a funny man.

1599
02:00:27,735 --> 02:00:33,833
MATT: All right, so you're back in town and you
have a wolf.

1600
02:00:33,833 --> 02:00:36,017
TRAVIS: Do we find a holding pen for the wolf?

1601
02:00:36,017 --> 02:00:38,735
TALIESIN: I don't think we need to. I think we can
communicate to him--

1602
02:00:38,735 --> 02:00:40,608
LAURA: No. Tell him not to attack villagers.

1603
02:00:40,608 --> 02:00:44,419
TALIESIN: Ask him if he'll be willing to keep the
town safe.

1604
02:00:44,419 --> 02:00:48,464
LAURA: Do it in a really aggressive way, though,
Keyleth. Stern.

1605
02:00:48,464 --> 02:00:50,389
MARISHA: Very aggressive? Okay. Okay.

1606
02:00:50,389 --> 02:00:52,592
SAM: We should find some food for the thing, too.

1607
02:00:52,592 --> 02:00:56,258
MARISHA: If I turned into a dog. If I turned into
a wolf, do you think he'd respect me more?

1608
02:00:56,258 --> 02:00:57,516
LAURA: No, he'll probably attack you.

1609
02:00:57,516 --> 02:00:58,692
TRAVIS: He'll mount you.

1610
02:00:58,692 --> 02:01:00,281
LAURA: Or he'll bone you.

1611
02:01:00,281 --> 02:01:01,695
TALIESIN: I'm not ready for that game.

1612
02:01:01,695 --> 02:01:02,962
SAM: Do it.

1613
02:01:02,962 --> 02:01:04,486
TRAVIS: Let's be clear.

1614
02:01:04,486 --> 02:01:07,320
(laughter)

1615
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:08,852
LAURA: Matt's like, "mm-mm."

1616
02:01:08,852 --> 02:01:10,355
LIAM: Oh, you soured the DM.

1617
02:01:10,355 --> 02:01:11,630
(laughter)

1618
02:01:11,630 --> 02:01:14,208
TALIESIN: To be fair, that's happened before.

1619
02:01:14,208 --> 02:01:15,940
LAURA: Yeah, I remember.

1620
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:17,170
TALIESIN: With the troll.

1621
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:20,492
TRAVIS: With the troll. It was so good. That was
you, wasn't it?

1622
02:01:20,492 --> 02:01:22,052
TALIESIN: No, it wasn't me. Was it you?

1623
02:01:22,052 --> 02:01:23,200
SAM: I don't know.

1624
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,604
TRAVIS: Who was getting humped on?

1625
02:01:24,604 --> 02:01:25,820
TALIESIN: I don't remember.

1626
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:30,819
SAM: Finalize this wolf so we can go kill
something.

1627
02:01:30,819 --> 02:01:39,016
MARISHA: I take my staff and I say, Galdric! I'm
being assertive.

1628
02:01:39,016 --> 02:01:40,128
LIAM: Yes.

1629
02:01:40,128 --> 02:01:41,539
SAM: She's the alpha.

1630
02:01:41,539 --> 02:01:43,607
LAURA: (whispering) Grog, go stand behind her.

1631
02:01:43,607 --> 02:01:47,846
MARISHA: You want a task? I'll give you one.

1632
02:01:47,846 --> 02:01:53,590
MATT: All right. How long does Speak With--

1633
02:01:53,590 --> 02:01:54,978
MARISHA: I don't know.

1634
02:01:54,978 --> 02:01:57,864
MATT: It lasts for ten minutes, so you can cast it
again. It's first level.

1635
02:01:57,864 --> 02:01:59,460
MARISHA: Oh, has it not been ten minutes?

1636
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:01,600
MATT: It has been more than ten minutes. It took
you three hours to return.

1637
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,524
MARISHA: Okay, we walked back? Okay, I'll cast it
again.

1638
02:02:03,524 --> 02:02:04,745
MATT: All righty.

1639
02:02:04,745 --> 02:02:09,500
MARISHA: Can I cast Speak With Animals on other
people? I can't, right? No.

1640
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:13,488
MATT: All right, so as you shout, go ahead and
make an animal handling check, with advantage

1641
02:02:13,488 --> 02:02:14,997
because of your ability to speak.

1642
02:02:14,997 --> 02:02:17,324
MARISHA: With advantage?

1643
02:02:17,324 --> 02:02:18,469
MATT: Yes.

1644
02:02:18,469 --> 02:02:28,577
MARISHA: I'll take the-- what is that, 16? Plus a
six, so 22.

1645
02:02:28,577 --> 02:02:38,141
MATT: Okay. Galdric turns to you and essentially
leans towards you and you get the essence, the

1646
02:02:38,141 --> 02:02:41,440
idea of a message across, and to keep me from
having to walk behind now, at this point, as you

1647
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:47,531
guys have managed to make seeming amends at the
moment, employs the idea of,

1648
02:02:47,531 --> 02:02:50,391
"I'll listen if you give me a task."

1649
02:02:50,391 --> 02:02:54,338
MARISHA: He talked back.

1650
02:02:54,338 --> 02:02:56,085
LAURA: Have him guard the village.

1651
02:02:56,085 --> 02:03:05,920
MARISHA: Okay. (louder) Galdric. Only a beast of
your great fortitude--

1652
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,471
LAURA: Just fucking tell him to do it!

1653
02:03:07,471 --> 02:03:11,141
MARISHA: Right, okay. Sorry. Would you like to
guard--

1654
02:03:11,141 --> 02:03:12,639
SAM: It's a command.

1655
02:03:12,639 --> 02:03:17,305
MARISHA: -- the town, Whitestone? (shouting) Guard
this town, dog.

1656
02:03:17,305 --> 02:03:19,026
TRAVIS: Keyleth, repeat after me.

1657
02:03:19,026 --> 02:03:19,996
MARISHA: Yes.

1658
02:03:19,996 --> 02:03:23,567
TRAVIS: In exchange for food, protect these
lands.

1659
02:03:23,567 --> 02:03:31,526
MARISHA: Galdric. In exchange for food, shelter,
and a cozy fire every once in awhile--

1660
02:03:31,526 --> 02:03:35,445
TRAVIS: I didn't say that shit. I didn't say that.
He's a wolf. He doesn't need those.

1661
02:03:35,445 --> 02:03:37,921
MARISHA: Patrol these lands.

1662
02:03:37,921 --> 02:03:39,197
LAURA: Protect these lands.

1663
02:03:39,197 --> 02:03:40,683
MARISHA: Protect these lands.

1664
02:03:40,683 --> 02:03:44,822
TRAVIS: (quietly) Holy shit.

1665
02:03:44,822 --> 02:03:47,411
MATT: "For how long?"

1666
02:03:47,411 --> 02:03:50,573
LAURA: (laughs) He already asked that.

1667
02:03:50,573 --> 02:03:52,401
MARISHA: Why does he want details? Why does the
dog want--

1668
02:03:52,401 --> 02:03:54,907
LAURA: As long as we need you to.

1669
02:03:54,907 --> 02:03:57,675
TRAVIS: No, no. A great danger approaches.

1670
02:03:57,675 --> 02:03:59,084
TALIESIN: Until the danger has passed.

1671
02:03:59,084 --> 02:04:00,560
TRAVIS: You'll know it when it comes.

1672
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:04,814
MARISHA: (clears throat) A great danger--

1673
02:04:04,814 --> 02:04:07,122
LAURA: Approaches!

1674
02:04:07,122 --> 02:04:17,700
MARISHA: Approaches! A great danger approaches.
Your service is required until that danger--

1675
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:19,132
TALIESIN: Has passed.

1676
02:04:19,132 --> 02:04:26,314
MARISHA: Has passed! Is no longer in effect.
You'll know. You'll know, because they're fucking

1677
02:04:26,314 --> 02:04:32,865
dragons, man. You'll know. Protect--

1678
02:04:32,865 --> 02:04:46,377
TRAVIS: I walk over and put my hand over Keyleth's
mouth. You stay. We feed you. Is there a tavern or

1679
02:04:46,377 --> 02:04:48,474
a butcher shop or something nearby?

1680
02:04:48,474 --> 02:04:56,084
MATT: There is a butcher. As you're having this
thought, however, Galdric turns back over to you

1681
02:04:56,084 --> 02:05:01,298
and says, "I can feed myself."

1682
02:05:01,298 --> 02:05:02,977
LAURA: Yeah, you can.

1683
02:05:02,977 --> 02:05:06,352
MATT: "But I will watch until this danger has
passed."

1684
02:05:06,352 --> 02:05:07,887
LAURA: Awesome.

1685
02:05:07,887 --> 02:05:09,361
MATT: "Then am I free to go?"

1686
02:05:09,361 --> 02:05:13,687
MARISHA: Then you are free to go.

1687
02:05:13,687 --> 02:05:22,070
MATT: "Very well. I grow tired of service. I wait
too long." And the wolf looks at you, gives you

1688
02:05:22,070 --> 02:05:25,003
like an acknowledgement, and then walks off into
the woods.

1689
02:05:25,003 --> 02:05:26,213
LAURA: Bye, buddy!

1690
02:05:26,213 --> 02:05:28,767
MARISHA: Thanks, Galdric. Appreciate it, man.

1691
02:05:28,767 --> 02:05:32,744
LAURA: Man, that's a cool-looking wolf.

1692
02:05:32,744 --> 02:05:36,142
MARISHA: I look at Grog. How was that? Did that
sound okay?

1693
02:05:36,142 --> 02:05:38,675
TRAVIS: That was the dumbest thing I've ever
heard.

1694
02:05:38,675 --> 02:05:41,485
(laughter)

1695
02:05:41,485 --> 02:05:42,964
TALIESIN: You did good, you did good.

1696
02:05:42,964 --> 02:05:44,316
SAM: I thought she did very well.

1697
02:05:44,316 --> 02:05:50,421
MARISHA: Thank you. It really liked you. You
should learn how to talk to animals.

1698
02:05:50,421 --> 02:05:52,090
LAURA: What is that? What is that you have? What
is that?

1699
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:56,332
TALIESIN: I'm holding onto the Raven's Slumber
jewel at the moment.

1700
02:05:56,332 --> 02:05:58,046
SAM: The thing that can capture evil.

1701
02:05:58,046 --> 02:06:02,100
TALIESIN: It's empty now, and do you know what I
bet would fit in it very nicely?

1702
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:04,821
TRAVIS: Me.

1703
02:06:04,821 --> 02:06:13,357
LAURA: And we can carry him around and then pop
him out. Wait, okay, wait. Is it going to hurt

1704
02:06:13,357 --> 02:06:15,058
him? Does it hurt him? Is it like, it's bad?

1705
02:06:15,058 --> 02:06:19,816
SAM: Not only does it not hurt him, he does not
age or feel any pain.

1706
02:06:19,816 --> 02:06:21,824
TRAVIS: A willing creature need not make a saving
throw.

1707
02:06:21,824 --> 02:06:24,531
TALIESIN: It's automatic, and no time passes.

1708
02:06:24,531 --> 02:06:30,475
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try it, and I'm going to
try it, and just to see how he likes it. If he's

1709
02:06:30,475 --> 02:06:31,743
okay with it.

1710
02:06:31,743 --> 02:06:32,589
MATT: Okay.

1711
02:06:32,589 --> 02:06:33,710
LAURA: Hey, buddy, come here.

1712
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:36,515
MATT: As you turn around and look, you see there's
a small puddle on the ground where Trinket has

1713
02:06:36,515 --> 02:06:41,751
vomited up. He's pushing dirt over it.

1714
02:06:41,751 --> 02:06:47,147
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got to teach him to quit
rummaging, that is really foul.

1715
02:06:47,147 --> 02:06:51,146
LAURA: What was that? Trinket, what did you eat?
Don't eat the puke. Do not eat the puke.

1716
02:06:51,146 --> 02:06:52,178
Come here.

1717
02:06:52,178 --> 02:06:53,783
MATT: Trinket's like scraping dirt over it.

1718
02:06:53,783 --> 02:06:55,445
TRAVIS: Got a carrot on your chin.

1719
02:06:55,445 --> 02:07:06,704
LAURA: Trinket. Do you want to go for a ride? You
like rides? Yeah? You want to go for one? All

1720
02:07:06,704 --> 02:07:11,362
right, sit still. This'll be fun. I don't know how
to use it.

1721
02:07:11,362 --> 02:07:13,245
TALIESIN: Just point, yep.

1722
02:07:13,245 --> 02:07:15,267
LAURA: I point to him with the--

1723
02:07:15,267 --> 02:07:17,876
SAM: You should probably say something cool.

1724
02:07:17,876 --> 02:07:22,686
LAURA: By the power vested in me, I now pronounce
you my Pokemon.

1725
02:07:22,686 --> 02:07:28,072
(laughter)

1726
02:07:28,072 --> 02:07:37,764
MATT: Words be damned. It takes you an action or
so to activate the crystal, but as you do, Trinket

1727
02:07:37,764 --> 02:07:43,995
gives a confused look before Trinket's shadow
seems to crawl up his legs until it forms into

1728
02:07:43,995 --> 02:07:50,089
this circle, this dark core, roughly half the size of
Trinket's form, before it

1729
02:07:50,089 --> 02:07:51,344
shoots into the crystal.

1730
02:07:51,344 --> 02:07:53,697
LAURA: Is he about this size, but I don't like
that one, is he about this size?

1731
02:07:53,697 --> 02:07:57,534
MATT: A little larger than that before he goes
into the crystal, but once he's in the crystal,

1732
02:07:57,534 --> 02:07:58,630
it's small.

1733
02:07:58,630 --> 02:07:59,738
LAURA: Oh, it's a little crystal?

1734
02:07:59,738 --> 02:08:01,321
LIAM: Trinkachu, I choose you.

1735
02:08:01,321 --> 02:08:05,322
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh. That's really fun.
Okay. How do I let him go?

1736
02:08:05,322 --> 02:08:08,942
MARISHA: I think you-- yeah.

1737
02:08:08,942 --> 02:08:10,314
LAURA: I release you.

1738
02:08:10,314 --> 02:08:16,252
MATT: Okay. As you do that, once again the same
dark energy you saw earlier spills out and hits

1739
02:08:16,252 --> 02:08:22,943
the ground in front of you, and from that dark
shadow area Trinket's form emerges, standing there

1740
02:08:22,943 --> 02:08:24,579
looking really confused.

1741
02:08:24,579 --> 02:08:27,933
LAURA: How was it? Did it hurt? Can you talk to
him? You can still talk to him. Talk to him. Ask

1742
02:08:27,933 --> 02:08:28,837
him if it hurt.

1743
02:08:28,837 --> 02:08:31,154
MATT: (vomiting noises) Vomits a little bit more
on the ground.

1744
02:08:31,154 --> 02:08:32,483
LAURA: Well, that's not good.

1745
02:08:32,483 --> 02:08:35,906
MARISHA: You know, sometimes the teleportation
makes you lose your lunch.

1746
02:08:35,906 --> 02:08:37,296
LAURA: Ask him how he's doing.

1747
02:08:37,296 --> 02:08:39,343
MARISHA: Trinket? You all right buddy? You all
right, there?

1748
02:08:39,343 --> 02:08:41,264
MATT: "Feeling sick."

1749
02:08:41,264 --> 02:08:43,878
LAURA: Ask him how the little car ride was, ask
him if he liked the ride.

1750
02:08:43,878 --> 02:08:46,528
MARISHA: How was the ride? Did you feel all right?
How was--?

1751
02:08:46,528 --> 02:08:47,822
MATT: "Yeah?"

1752
02:08:47,822 --> 02:08:51,326
LAURA: Okay, would you mind, ask him if he'd mind
doing that on occasion, you know, whenever

1753
02:08:51,363 --> 02:08:52,625
I need him to.

1754
02:08:52,625 --> 02:08:54,192
MARISHA: What was it like in there? Was it--?

1755
02:08:54,192 --> 02:08:55,535
MATT: "I don't remember."

1756
02:08:55,535 --> 02:08:57,675
MARISHA: Okay, that's good, that's good. Would you
mind--

1757
02:08:57,675 --> 02:08:59,527
LAURA: Ask him if he cares if I do it again, ask
him if he cares.

1758
02:08:59,527 --> 02:09:02,981
MARISHA: Would you mind doing that, you know,
frequently? On occasion.

1759
02:09:02,981 --> 02:09:04,560
MATT "If she wants me to, okay."

1760
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:10,148
LAURA: What did he say, what did he say? He looked
really cute when he said something.

1761
02:09:10,148 --> 02:09:15,495
MARISHA: You have a lot of men who will do
anything for you.

1762
02:09:15,495 --> 02:09:20,716
LAURA: Oh, buddy! I go and hug him really tight
and scratch his ears.

1763
02:09:20,716 --> 02:09:22,370
MATT: You do, and avoid the little bit of--

1764
02:09:22,370 --> 02:09:30,462
LAURA: --vomit on, I don't even care! Oh my gosh,
thank you! This is the best, this is the best and

1765
02:09:30,462 --> 02:09:33,344
we can travel with him, we can climb with him, we
can sneak around.

1766
02:09:33,344 --> 02:09:36,209
SAM: Hey, and if Trinket isn't in it, you can also
use it to capture baddies.

1767
02:09:36,209 --> 02:09:38,332
LAURA: I know, it's great!

1768
02:09:38,332 --> 02:09:42,422
TALIESIN: And because of the way that the
projection works, you could also in theory capture

1769
02:09:42,422 --> 02:09:46,208
a baddie and then let them loose off a cliff and
watch them drop.

1770
02:09:46,208 --> 02:09:48,707
LAURA: Oh my god.

1771
02:09:48,707 --> 02:09:50,261
MARISHA: Oh my god, you're right.

1772
02:09:50,261 --> 02:09:52,446
TALIESIN: It's very convenient.

1773
02:09:52,446 --> 02:09:56,255
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Okay.

1774
02:09:56,255 --> 02:09:59,264
MATT: So. You have a crystal, you've set a wolf on
a path.

1775
02:09:59,264 --> 02:10:00,489
SAM: Where are we going next?

1776
02:10:00,489 --> 02:10:01,966
MATT: Where are you going now?

1777
02:10:01,966 --> 02:10:03,406
TALIESIN: Your home, I imagine.

1778
02:10:03,406 --> 02:10:04,801
LAURA: Don't we need to--oh, yeah.

1779
02:10:04,801 --> 02:10:06,222
SAM: What's our to-do list?

1780
02:10:06,222 --> 02:10:11,300
MARISHA: We don't have to worry about it. We can,
it's fine.

1781
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:12,859
TALIESIN: Fire Ashari it is.

1782
02:10:12,859 --> 02:10:15,302
SAM: Wait, wait, wait. What are the things that we
need to do?

1783
02:10:15,302 --> 02:10:16,912
LAURA: We need to check in on Keyleth's family.

1784
02:10:16,912 --> 02:10:18,336
SAM: Cobalt Reserve, Ashari.

1785
02:10:18,336 --> 02:10:20,513
LAURA: Grog's family.

1786
02:10:20,513 --> 02:10:23,972
SAM: Did we already take care of Osysa's mate,
Frostweald?

1787
02:10:23,972 --> 02:10:26,085
LAURA: No, but that's down--

1788
02:10:26,085 --> 02:10:27,654
TALIESIN: That's far.

1789
02:10:27,654 --> 02:10:29,462
MARISHA: That's the other Vestige, correct?

1790
02:10:29,462 --> 02:10:31,294
LAURA: Yes, that's over by Grog's family.

1791
02:10:31,294 --> 02:10:33,239
MATT: That's information about the Vestiges.

1792
02:10:33,239 --> 02:10:34,875
SAM: We need to steal an airship.

1793
02:10:34,875 --> 02:10:37,221
TALIESIN: I agree, that's still very important.

1794
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:39,951
TRAVIS: I can't remember where, what--

1795
02:10:39,951 --> 02:10:41,773
LAURA: They were by Kraghammer.

1796
02:10:41,773 --> 02:10:45,236
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'm having terrible hiccups.

1797
02:10:45,236 --> 02:10:52,520
SAM: What about, we need to find Kaylie at
some point. We also need to, who's gone, where's

1798
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:54,662
Allu-- where's Ki-- where's people?

1799
02:10:54,662 --> 02:10:57,917
LAURA: Allura should be here in like a day. She
should be here very soon.

1800
02:10:57,917 --> 02:11:00,152
TRAVIS: What's close to here? (hiccups)

1801
02:11:00,152 --> 02:11:02,994
TALIESIN: Nothing's close, we're specifically far
away from everything.

1802
02:11:02,994 --> 02:11:05,290
MARISHA: But we can go wherever we want as long as
we've been there before.

1803
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:08,817
TRAVIS: Well, we should definitely go to the Fire
Ashari.

1804
02:11:08,817 --> 02:11:10,258
TALIESIN: Fire Ashari is the next--

1805
02:11:10,258 --> 02:11:11,714
LAURA: We should go to the Fire Ashari.

1806
02:11:11,714 --> 02:11:13,679
MARISHA: Oh god, I'm immediately nauseous.

1807
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:15,268
MATT: (bear noises)

1808
02:11:15,268 --> 02:11:16,610
LIAM: That's two of us.

1809
02:11:16,610 --> 02:11:21,453
MARISHA: Oh, Trinket, buddy. What time is it?

1810
02:11:21,453 --> 02:11:23,105
LAURA: (laughs) Do you need some water?

1811
02:11:23,105 --> 02:11:27,575
MATT: It's still, with the travel to and from,
it's middle afternoon, like one o'clock in the

1812
02:11:27,575 --> 02:11:28,700
afternoon.

1813
02:11:28,700 --> 02:11:30,222
TALIESIN: Take it.

1814
02:11:30,222 --> 02:11:33,628
SAM: If we're going to go, do we need anything
before we leave? We got everything we need?

1815
02:11:33,628 --> 02:11:37,400
Potions and stuff? Want to buy some meat for your
cooler?

1816
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:41,390
LAURA: Yeah, let's get some meat.

1817
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:44,974
MATT: It's pretty easy to go ahead and procure it,
five gold of meat will fill that thing.

1818
02:11:44,974 --> 02:11:46,025
LAURA: Yeah!

1819
02:11:46,025 --> 02:11:48,625
MATT: So go ahead and mark five gold off your
paper.

1820
02:11:48,625 --> 02:11:50,813
SAM: How much, could I buy a medical kit
somewhere?

1821
02:11:50,813 --> 02:11:53,634
MATT: Yeah, you could find a general store and
purchase a medical kit.

1822
02:11:53,634 --> 02:11:54,779
SAM: How much is that?

1823
02:11:54,779 --> 02:11:56,352
MATT: I'm going to look that up right now.

1824
02:11:56,352 --> 02:11:58,201
SAM: All right, whatever, I've got it.

1825
02:11:58,201 --> 02:12:00,873
TALIESIN: It's nifty that you have a book that
tells you how much something like that costs.

1826
02:12:00,873 --> 02:12:04,746
MATT: Imagine that. It's like it's a handbook of
some kind, it's crazy.

1827
02:12:04,746 --> 02:12:07,055
MARISHA: Does anyone have any fire-resistant
items?

1828
02:12:07,055 --> 02:12:08,411
LAURA: He does.

1829
02:12:08,411 --> 02:12:09,577
LIAM: I do.

1830
02:12:09,577 --> 02:12:10,824
LAURA: Put it on.

1831
02:12:10,824 --> 02:12:13,228
MARISHA: I might pick up some fire resistant
potions as well.

1832
02:12:13,228 --> 02:12:20,227
TRAVIS: I have this black iron plate that I
haven't used ever. 'While wearing this heavy plate

1833
02:12:20,227 --> 02:12:22,969
'armor, the bearer gains resistance to any fire
damage.'

1834
02:12:22,969 --> 02:12:25,180
MATT: Five gold for an herbalist's kit for you.

1835
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:27,246
LAURA: Oh, plate armor, none of us can wear it but
Pike.

1836
02:12:27,246 --> 02:12:28,871
MATT: An herbalist's kit, like five gold.

1837
02:12:28,871 --> 02:12:30,493
SAM: Can that stabilize people?

1838
02:12:30,493 --> 02:12:32,592
MATT: If used with a medicine check, yeah.

1839
02:12:32,592 --> 02:12:35,550
LAURA: Okay, I have this, which I can't wear.

1840
02:12:35,550 --> 02:12:37,153
TALIESIN: What is that?

1841
02:12:37,153 --> 02:12:41,798
LAURA: It's a purple and black robe. It was Lady
Briarwood's robes.

1842
02:12:41,798 --> 02:12:43,092
TALIESIN: What does it do?

1843
02:12:43,092 --> 02:12:47,836
LAURA: Clings to nearby darkness as you walk.
While wearing this robe, you gain resistance to

1844
02:12:47,836 --> 02:12:52,144
piercing damage. Anybody need pierce resistance
that can wear robes?

1845
02:12:52,144 --> 02:12:57,638
TALIESIN: I'm pretty reasonable.

1846
02:12:57,638 --> 02:13:00,164
SAM: Do I wear robes?

1847
02:13:00,164 --> 02:13:02,201
MATT: Robes would be worn instead of your armor.

1848
02:13:02,201 --> 02:13:03,479
SAM: No thanks.

1849
02:13:03,479 --> 02:13:09,744
LAURA: What about Gloves of Missile Snaring? That
appeal to anyone?

1850
02:13:09,744 --> 02:13:11,540
SAM: Missile snaring? What does that do?

1851
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:17,732
LAURA: These gloves seem to almost meld into your
hands when you don them, and when a ranged weapon

1852
02:13:17,732 --> 02:13:22,479
attack hits you, you can use your reaction to
reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity

1853
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:28,355
modifier provided that you have a free hand. If
you reduce the damage to zero, you can catch the

1854
02:13:28,355 --> 02:13:31,195
missile if it's small enough to hold in that
hand.

1855
02:13:31,195 --> 02:13:32,703
TALIESIN: Does it require attuning?

1856
02:13:32,703 --> 02:13:34,504
MARISHA: They're pretty sleek.

1857
02:13:34,504 --> 02:13:36,653
LAURA: It requires two, no it just requires one
free hand.

1858
02:13:36,653 --> 02:13:38,124
TALIESIN: Yes, but does it require attuning?

1859
02:13:38,124 --> 02:13:40,360
LAURA: Yes it does, it requires attuning.

1860
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:42,453
TALIESIN: I might be attuned out at this point.

1861
02:13:42,453 --> 02:13:45,355
LAURA: Anybody? I feel like that could be cool for
you, Scanlan.

1862
02:13:45,355 --> 02:13:47,642
SAM: I think I can take it?

1863
02:13:47,642 --> 02:13:52,817
TALIESIN: What's your dex? Your dexterity is not
very-- actually, it might work out well for me,

1864
02:13:52,817 --> 02:13:54,193
weirdly enough.

1865
02:13:54,193 --> 02:13:55,548
MARISHA: Are you fully attuned?

1866
02:13:55,548 --> 02:13:58,344
TALIESIN: I can undo something that I'm not
using.

1867
02:13:58,344 --> 02:14:03,967
MARISHA: Percy, you have access here in Whitestone
to alchemy supplies, correct?

1868
02:14:03,967 --> 02:14:09,743
TALIESIN: Matt, I have access to alchemy supplies
here in Whitestone, correct?

1869
02:14:09,743 --> 02:14:14,635
MATT: (laughs) I mean, there are elements of your
initial workshop I guess, that a lot of supplies

1870
02:14:14,635 --> 02:14:18,394
have been cannibalized but a few things can be
pieced together. Plus there was a lot of

1871
02:14:18,394 --> 02:14:24,312
alchemical elements and tools that were utilized
in the subterranean tunnels as part of the

1872
02:14:24,312 --> 02:14:30,922
refinement process for the whitestone residuum,
the large vats of acid that were distilled by the

1873
02:14:30,922 --> 02:14:35,063
Briarwoods while they were here, and there are
other elements of their own tinkering in the

1874
02:14:35,063 --> 02:14:39,034
alchemical arts that remain scattered throughout
the castle. So yeah, you can definitely find

1875
02:14:39,034 --> 02:14:42,491
enough to tinker with if you want.

1876
02:14:42,491 --> 02:14:46,880
MARISHA: I mean, we could take the rest of the
evening and I can attempt to make some fire

1877
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,590
resist potions.

1878
02:14:48,590 --> 02:14:49,933
SAM: Eh.

1879
02:14:49,933 --> 02:14:54,363
TRAVIS: All right, here's what I'm thinking,
right? I mean, if we go after my herd, we're in

1880
02:14:54,363 --> 02:15:01,101
for a fight. A big one. If we go to your Fire
Ashari, we're doing recon and hopefully learning

1881
02:15:01,101 --> 02:15:02,271
something, right?

1882
02:15:02,271 --> 02:15:06,962
MARISHA: Well, we're going to be in for a fight at
the Fire Ashari as well because there's a giant

1883
02:15:06,962 --> 02:15:12,390
sunder in the fire plane, and last time I checked
there were fire imps and elementals pouring

1884
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:13,978
through there.

1885
02:15:13,978 --> 02:15:15,462
TRAVIS: Are those bad?

1886
02:15:15,462 --> 02:15:16,433
TALIESIN: Eh.

1887
02:15:16,433 --> 02:15:17,885
MARISHA: They're annoying

1888
02:15:17,885 --> 02:15:22,100
TALIESIN: As long as we're quick we can go about
it.

1889
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:23,676
MARISHA: Well.

1890
02:15:23,676 --> 02:15:25,234
SAM: What's our mission?

1891
02:15:25,234 --> 02:15:30,130
TRAVIS: You really want to get the rest of the
testicles of--

1892
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:35,452
MARISHA: I mean, we could theoretically see if there are
survivors and I can attempt to close the tear in

1893
02:15:35,452 --> 02:15:43,187
the plane. I don't know if I can do that. However,
I don't know anyone else particularly more

1894
02:15:43,187 --> 02:15:45,117
qualified to attempt it.

1895
02:15:45,117 --> 02:15:48,728
TRAVIS: Allura or that bearded dude.

1896
02:15:48,728 --> 02:15:52,032
MARISHA: We're talking about the Fire Ashari and
possibly what to do there.

1897
02:15:52,032 --> 02:15:54,813
LAURA: Oh.

1898
02:15:54,813 --> 02:15:57,361
MARISHA: We can go and look for survivors--

1899
02:15:57,361 --> 02:15:59,564
LAURA: And bring them here.

1900
02:15:59,564 --> 02:16:02,886
MARISHA: And someone should probably close the
tear in the fire plane.

1901
02:16:02,886 --> 02:16:05,151
LAURA: Should we wait for Allura then, before we
go?

1902
02:16:05,151 --> 02:16:09,061
TRAVIS: Well, if there are survivors, they might
not be that way for very long if we don't go.

1903
02:16:09,061 --> 02:16:11,782
LAURA: They've been there for a while already.

1904
02:16:11,782 --> 02:16:13,092
MARISHA: If there are survivors--

1905
02:16:13,092 --> 02:16:14,503
LAURA: Then they're surviving.

1906
02:16:14,503 --> 02:16:19,078
MARISHA: They've survived. I agree. It's not going
to be pretty.

1907
02:16:19,078 --> 02:16:20,938
TALIESIN: I know you don't want to go.

1908
02:16:20,938 --> 02:16:22,115
MARISHA: I really don't.

1909
02:16:22,115 --> 02:16:33,542
TALIESIN: But we need to go. I say we take the
rest of the day. You make your potions, we leave

1910
02:16:33,542 --> 02:16:34,665
first thing in the morning.

1911
02:16:34,665 --> 02:16:36,282
LAURA: Wait for Allura, hopefully she'll be here
by then.

1912
02:16:36,282 --> 02:16:40,197
TALIESIN: Maybe Allura will join us by tomorrow
morning. If not, we teleport over.

1913
02:16:40,197 --> 02:16:43,868
MATT: Okay, you guys are going to rest for the
evening?

1914
02:16:43,868 --> 02:16:51,217
TRAVIS: Wait, hold on, is there like a house of
entertainment in Whitestone? I know it's just

1915
02:16:51,217 --> 02:16:53,348
getting back on its feet but you know.

1916
02:16:53,348 --> 02:16:55,313
MATT: That would be a question more for Percival.

1917
02:16:55,313 --> 02:17:02,639
TRAVIS: Percy? I'm having a bit of a soul struggle
and I'm wondering if I might bend

1918
02:17:02,639 --> 02:17:04,303
your ear for a moment.

1919
02:17:04,303 --> 02:17:05,207
TALIESIN: Sure.

1920
02:17:05,207 --> 02:17:06,838
TRAVIS: Yeah, could I speak to you over here?

1921
02:17:06,838 --> 02:17:07,811
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1922
02:17:07,811 --> 02:17:11,018
TRAVIS: Right, so, like, I want to get my freak
on.

1923
02:17:11,018 --> 02:17:13,882
TALIESIN: I don't feel that way about you.

1924
02:17:13,882 --> 02:17:15,070
(laughter)

1925
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:16,394
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I, I'm sorry.

1926
02:17:16,394 --> 02:17:17,790
TALIESIN: I mean, you're very attractive.

1927
02:17:17,790 --> 02:17:21,917
TRAVIS: That was very unclear. So I know this
is like your home and stuff and you might not have

1928
02:17:21,917 --> 02:17:24,627
been aware of it, but they have these houses where
like....

1929
02:17:24,627 --> 02:17:28,250
TALIESIN: Oh, where you get your freak on!

1930
02:17:28,250 --> 02:17:29,109
TRAVIS: Yes.

1931
02:17:29,109 --> 02:17:31,115
TALIESIN: Yes. Yes, we have them.

1932
02:17:31,115 --> 02:17:33,786
TRAVIS: Oh good, do you think they're still in
order?

1933
02:17:33,786 --> 02:17:36,520
TALIESIN: Oh, I imagine so.

1934
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:37,967
TRAVIS: Could you point me in that direction?

1935
02:17:37,967 --> 02:17:41,153
TALIESIN: No, I have no idea where they are. I do
know that they exist. I actually had things to do

1936
02:17:41,153 --> 02:17:42,792
here. I didn't have time for these.

1937
02:17:42,792 --> 02:17:46,230
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, me too, important things. I was
thinking for Scanlan in case he gets bored, you

1938
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:48,894
know, you've got to keep him focused.

1939
02:17:48,894 --> 02:17:52,106
TALIESIN: I wouldn't actually know where any of
these places were, would I?

1940
02:17:52,106 --> 02:17:55,364
MATT: No, and those that did exist in this town
have not been...

1941
02:17:55,364 --> 02:18:00,137
TALIESIN: I figured as much. I'm just fucking with
him. Okay. No.

1942
02:18:00,137 --> 02:18:03,724
TRAVIS: Oh, okay, well, I'll let Scanlan know.
Just keep it between you and me 'cause he's very

1943
02:18:03,724 --> 02:18:05,602
sensitive about these things.

1944
02:18:05,602 --> 02:18:10,771
TALIESIN: Your secret is safe with my
indifference. That's fine.

1945
02:18:10,771 --> 02:18:13,951
TRAVIS: Well, my, my, indifference

1946
02:18:13,951 --> 02:18:15,851
TALIESIN: I know you do.

1947
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:16,734
TRAVIS: Yep.

1948
02:18:16,734 --> 02:18:17,841
TALIESIN: You're wonderful.

1949
02:18:17,841 --> 02:18:19,807
MARISHA: Can I start telling that to people in
real life?

1950
02:18:19,807 --> 02:18:21,807
TALIESIN: Yes you can. I do it all the time.

1951
02:18:21,807 --> 02:18:23,517
MARISHA: Yes. Your secret is safe with my
indifference.

1952
02:18:23,517 --> 02:18:25,190
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm going to rest.

1953
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:30,439
SAM: Before we set off on this, is there anything
closer or more pressing? I don't actually know why

1954
02:18:30,439 --> 02:18:33,239
we're going to her place, but I'm fine with it.

1955
02:18:33,239 --> 02:18:40,171
MARISHA: To look for survivors and close the giant
tear in the fire plane that evil, well not evil,

1956
02:18:40,171 --> 02:18:42,462
fiery entities are pouring through.

1957
02:18:42,462 --> 02:18:44,026
TALIESIN: It's a hellmouth, it's basically a
hellmouth.

1958
02:18:44,026 --> 02:18:45,532
TRAVIS: It's either that or we go goliath
hunting.

1959
02:18:45,532 --> 02:18:46,782
LAURA: That's next.

1960
02:18:46,782 --> 02:18:49,337
TALIESIN: But this is quick, this is something
that we can knock off the list.

1961
02:18:49,337 --> 02:18:50,741
SAM: All right, let's knock it off.

1962
02:18:50,741 --> 02:18:52,565
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, let's just check it off.

1963
02:18:52,565 --> 02:18:58,661
LIAM: As we're walking through town, do I see any
weaponsmiths?

1964
02:18:58,661 --> 02:19:02,329
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1965
02:19:02,329 --> 02:19:03,647
LIAM: Okay.

1966
02:19:03,647 --> 02:19:07,121
TALIESIN: I'll help you make the potions.

1967
02:19:07,121 --> 02:19:11,194
LIAM: 21.

1968
02:19:11,194 --> 02:19:16,247
MATT: Okay, that'll help cut down on the time. 21?
There are two functional smiths left in the town.

1969
02:19:16,247 --> 02:19:24,970
There were two more than that overall, that were
more like blacksmithy, but they both unfortunately

1970
02:19:24,970 --> 02:19:29,511
lost their lives in the insurrection. But there
are two functional blacksmiths in this, yeah.

1971
02:19:29,511 --> 02:19:32,420
LIAM: And one's nearby, to pass through?

1972
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:35,573
MATT: About a ten-minute diversion.

1973
02:19:35,573 --> 02:19:37,059
LIAM: I'm splitting off from the group.

1974
02:19:37,059 --> 02:19:38,493
MATT: Okay.

1975
02:19:38,493 --> 02:19:39,976
SAM: We've got to get out of here.

1976
02:19:39,976 --> 02:19:42,960
LIAM: One's in front of me now?

1977
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:49,234
MATT: Well, you find your way to-- it's a small
blacksmith, and most of it's outside. Though the

1978
02:19:49,234 --> 02:19:57,120
day is growing late, you do see an older
gentleman, long, tattered grey hair pulled into a

1979
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:01,290
very tight bun in the back and a beard that is
actually tied off to the side. Otherwise it would

1980
02:20:01,290 --> 02:20:07,117
be hanging down into his work. He's wearing
soot-covered clothes, big leather apron, leather

1981
02:20:07,117 --> 02:20:13,655
gloves, and he's currently in the process of (ping
ping) turning over and hammering out a piece of

1982
02:20:13,655 --> 02:20:15,760
orange glowing steel.

1983
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:20,204
LIAM: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, I have a very
simple request.

1984
02:20:20,204 --> 02:20:24,040
MATT: He doesn't stop. He seems to, he
acknowledges your presence but he's still working

1985
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:26,526
as he's listening. (smithing sounds)

1986
02:20:26,526 --> 02:20:30,407
LIAM: I have six gold burning a hole in my pocket.
I'm not looking for anything simple. Do you have a

1987
02:20:30,407 --> 02:20:32,921
short sword? A regular old shortsword.

1988
02:20:32,921 --> 02:20:37,934
MATT: (ting) He looks over at you. "If that's what
you're looking for, on that wall over there we've

1989
02:20:37,934 --> 02:20:41,243
"got two shortswords." (ting)

1990
02:20:41,243 --> 02:20:43,613
LIAM: What's the difference between the two that I
can see?

1991
02:20:43,613 --> 02:20:47,724
MATT: (smithing sounds) That you can see? Make a
perception check.

1992
02:20:47,724 --> 02:20:54,564
LIAM: 22.

1993
02:20:54,564 --> 02:21:01,346
MATT: Looking over them both, from this distance,
they're both made with different hilt designs and

1994
02:21:01,346 --> 02:21:05,100
different pommel designs, the grips are a little
different but other than that the blades are

1995
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:06,519
pretty much identical.

1996
02:21:06,519 --> 02:21:11,113
LIAM: I grab one off the wall. I slap down six
gold, which I know is way too much and say, thank

1997
02:21:11,113 --> 02:21:14,259
you sir. Pelor lives here. And I walk away.

1998
02:21:14,259 --> 02:21:16,782
MATT: Okay, as you start walking away he goes,
"Hey."

1999
02:21:16,782 --> 02:21:17,815
LIAM: Yeah?

2000
02:21:17,815 --> 02:21:21,182
MATT: "You're going to pay proper for that
shortsword."

2001
02:21:21,182 --> 02:21:22,982
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry. How much does it cost?

2002
02:21:22,982 --> 02:21:24,825
MATT: "12 gold pieces."

2003
02:21:24,825 --> 02:21:30,895
LIAM: My apologies. 12?

2004
02:21:30,895 --> 02:21:33,714
MATT: "12 gold pieces, friend."

2005
02:21:33,714 --> 02:21:39,414
LIAM: So I put down six. I put down another 14. I
really apologize. I was just confused.

2006
02:21:39,414 --> 02:21:44,368
MATT: "It's all right. No harm no foul." Takes the
gold and scoops it and puts it into his pouch.

2007
02:21:44,368 --> 02:21:46,676
"Have a good day."

2008
02:21:46,676 --> 02:21:53,116
LIAM: I walk down the street going like-- it's
big.

2009
02:21:53,116 --> 02:21:57,909
MATT: It's much bigger than you're used to, but
it's got a fine balance to it and it's well-made.

2010
02:21:57,909 --> 02:22:01,065
All right, so as you guys have all--

2011
02:22:01,065 --> 02:22:02,826
LAURA: I've got an opal dagger you could have
used.

2012
02:22:02,826 --> 02:22:04,271
LIAM: I don't need your dagger.

2013
02:22:04,271 --> 02:22:05,738
TALIESIN: We're going to make our potions?

2014
02:22:05,738 --> 02:22:07,410
MATT: Yes, yes. All right, so.

2015
02:22:07,410 --> 02:22:09,560
MARISHA: I have another question.

2016
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:11,934
MATT: What is your other question?

2017
02:22:11,934 --> 02:22:18,523
MARISHA: Before we all go to bed tonight can we
get like a fuckton of the green stone under

2018
02:22:18,523 --> 02:22:19,552
Whitestone?

2019
02:22:19,552 --> 02:22:20,893
TALIESIN: There's really not a lot of it.

2020
02:22:20,893 --> 02:22:25,246
MARISHA: Say like $1,000 worth and maybe have like
a real nice Heroes' Feast before tomorrow?

2021
02:22:25,246 --> 02:22:26,447
LIAM: Wise as fuck.

2022
02:22:26,447 --> 02:22:29,861
LAURA: Or in the morning.

2023
02:22:29,861 --> 02:22:31,863
LIAM: Heroes' Breakfast.

2024
02:22:31,863 --> 02:22:35,277
MARISHA: I've got to do it at night, because I
have to Tree Stride in the morning.

2025
02:22:35,277 --> 02:22:40,862
MATT: You can choose either to create the potion
or to mine the residuum for the evening. You

2026
02:22:40,862 --> 02:22:45,404
cannot do both. Both are time, like, to pull that
material from the-- because most of it that

2027
02:22:45,404 --> 02:22:51,283
remains has been already embedded within the
ziggurat beneath. You would actually have to

2028
02:22:51,283 --> 02:22:53,469
physically chip it from the structure.

2029
02:22:53,469 --> 02:22:54,905
LAURA: I have a plan, Keyleth.

2030
02:22:54,905 --> 02:22:55,708
MARISHA: Yes?

2031
02:22:55,708 --> 02:23:07,192
LAURA: We will cover the 1,000 gold from our own
party funds and have someone here mine some shit

2032
02:23:07,192 --> 02:23:09,241
for us and give it to us later.

2033
02:23:09,241 --> 02:23:13,194
MARISHA: I like that plan, yeah. Sounds good to
me.

2034
02:23:13,194 --> 02:23:14,703
SAM: How about the wolf?

2035
02:23:14,703 --> 02:23:18,026
TALIESIN: So potions.

2036
02:23:18,026 --> 02:23:23,780
LAURA: Percival, do you have people here who can
mine? Looking for work, people--?

2037
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:25,470
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, why not?

2038
02:23:25,470 --> 02:23:29,998
TALIESIN: I'll let them know that they should
start trying to pull the residuum out of the wall,

2039
02:23:29,998 --> 02:23:32,048
but it's dangerous down there.

2040
02:23:32,048 --> 02:23:33,151
LAURA: Yeah, it is.

2041
02:23:33,151 --> 02:23:37,659
TALIESIN: And tampering with it is definitely...

2042
02:23:37,659 --> 02:23:40,739
TRAVIS: Necessary.

2043
02:23:40,739 --> 02:23:43,526
TALIESIN: Should be ginger. It would, I'm trying
to keep everything ginger down there.

2044
02:23:43,526 --> 02:23:47,944
LAURA: So maybe we should take 1,000 gold just from
your family stores then, huh? That might be

2045
02:23:47,944 --> 02:23:49,221
smarter.

2046
02:23:49,221 --> 02:23:55,131
TALIESIN: We currently have 1,000 gold from my
family stores that are in the group treasury at

2047
02:23:55,131 --> 02:23:56,152
the moment.

2048
02:23:56,152 --> 02:24:00,025
LAURA: Oh, we do. No, that's 500. That was just
500. Just so you know.

2049
02:24:00,025 --> 02:24:01,560
TALIESIN: I feel like it was more than that.

2050
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,016
LAURA: No, it was just 500.

2051
02:24:03,016 --> 02:24:05,180
LIAM: Hey, de Rolo, do you remember what happened
yesterday?

2052
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:08,105
TALIESIN: He's not there.

2053
02:24:08,105 --> 02:24:09,757
LAURA: Isn't he, though?

2054
02:24:09,757 --> 02:24:12,119
TALIESIN: I was going to do such a nice
thing for you, but never mind now.

2055
02:24:12,119 --> 02:24:15,594
LAURA: (laughs) No, no, no, do something really
nice for me.

2056
02:24:15,594 --> 02:24:18,271
LIAM: Where did I go? Oh, I went to buy a
shortsword.

2057
02:24:18,271 --> 02:24:20,680
TALIESIN: No, never mind. You went to buy a
shortsword.

2058
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:25,258
LAURA: Dear, dear, dear, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm
sorry. Do nice things. All right?

2059
02:24:25,258 --> 02:24:29,293
TALIESIN: I'm trying to be gentle with my family
right now. They're taking on an awful lot.

2060
02:24:29,293 --> 02:24:31,869
LAURA: You're right. They're taking on so many
people.

2061
02:24:31,869 --> 02:24:34,637
TALIESIN: And we'll see what we can do.

2062
02:24:34,637 --> 02:24:37,342
LIAM: I'd like to think you hear me in your mind.

2063
02:24:37,342 --> 02:24:40,033
TALIESIN: Always fucking hear you in my mind.

2064
02:24:40,033 --> 02:24:44,260
LAURA: Let's just use the damned party funds for
the time being. It's fine, Keyleth. This is a really

2065
02:24:44,308 --> 02:24:45,755
important feast.

2066
02:24:45,755 --> 02:24:48,605
TALIESIN: We're busy making potions.

2067
02:24:48,605 --> 02:24:49,915
LAURA: All right.

2068
02:24:49,915 --> 02:24:53,104
MATT: So you prepare a Heroes' Feast before you
begin this potion-creation process? Is that what I

2069
02:24:53,104 --> 02:24:54,367
understand or not?

2070
02:24:54,367 --> 02:24:55,324
LAURA: What?

2071
02:24:55,324 --> 02:24:59,733
MARISHA: Can I make some potions and then, like, I
make dinner for us before we go to bed?

2072
02:24:59,733 --> 02:25:05,251
MATT: It's going to take you about the length of a
day to create the potion, with his help it takes

2073
02:25:05,251 --> 02:25:12,346
it to about half, so it'll be about 12 hours of
creating. Eight to 12 hours. So.

2074
02:25:12,346 --> 02:25:13,637
TRAVIS: Pick one.

2075
02:25:13,637 --> 02:25:14,882
TALIESIN: Pick one.

2076
02:25:14,882 --> 02:25:16,574
MARISHA: I'll do a damn feast.

2077
02:25:16,574 --> 02:25:17,731
TALIESIN: No potion?

2078
02:25:17,731 --> 02:25:21,062
MATT: You can do the potion as well. The feast
only takes a moment to cast.

2079
02:25:21,062 --> 02:25:23,151
MARISHA: All right, okay. Yeah.

2080
02:25:23,151 --> 02:25:27,594
MATT: I'm just saying, be aware that you guys will
probably have, if you want to get a full rest

2081
02:25:27,594 --> 02:25:31,304
after that potion creation process, you're going
to have to wait until like this time tomorrow,

2082
02:25:31,304 --> 02:25:34,673
like late in the day to make your journey. Which
is fine, if you're willing to be patient about it.

2083
02:25:34,673 --> 02:25:36,313
TRAVIS: Sure.

2084
02:25:36,313 --> 02:25:40,132
MATT: Yes, no?

2085
02:25:40,132 --> 02:25:43,364
TRAVIS: Say one, just say one.

2086
02:25:43,364 --> 02:25:48,110
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it, let's do it. Let's go
in prepared and then we can always rest on that side.

2087
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:50,239
MATT: Cool. For a fine, fine dinner.

2088
02:25:50,239 --> 02:25:54,042
LAURA: Just want to make sure we feast right
before we leave so that it's most useful.

2089
02:25:54,042 --> 02:26:00,634
MATT: All right, so. You, everyone else goes to
sleep while you and Percy work tirelessly through

2090
02:26:00,634 --> 02:26:03,478
the night. If I could have you--

2091
02:26:03,478 --> 02:26:04,920
LIAM: Fuck!

2092
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:09,372
MATT: (laughs) Just for the sake of it, I want you
to go ahead and make an arcana check.

2093
02:26:09,372 --> 02:26:14,674
MARISHA: Aw, an arcana? Do I get advantage because
of my little skill in alchemy? I'm skilled in

2094
02:26:14,674 --> 02:26:15,705
alchemy.

2095
02:26:15,705 --> 02:26:18,007
MATT: Yeah. Oh, that's right you are, never mind,
go ahead and do that.

2096
02:26:18,007 --> 02:26:21,997
MATT: Proficiency bonus, are you proficient in
alchemy?

2097
02:26:21,997 --> 02:26:22,905
MARISHA: Yeah.

2098
02:26:22,905 --> 02:26:26,696
MATT: So proficiency bonus, and for this, use
intellect modifier.

2099
02:26:26,696 --> 02:26:36,508
MARISHA: Okay. Intellect, which makes it plus
seven. Do I have advan-- ooh, I rolled a natural 19.

2100
02:26:36,508 --> 02:26:46,280
MATT: Okay. We'll say, for the fair cost of,
reduced due to the roll, 450 gold pieces, you

2101
02:26:46,280 --> 02:26:49,145
create a potion of resistance of your choice of
resistance.

2102
02:26:49,145 --> 02:26:50,317
MARISHA: Just one?

2103
02:26:50,317 --> 02:26:51,330
MATT: Just one.

2104
02:26:51,330 --> 02:26:52,117
MARISHA: Fire.

2105
02:26:52,117 --> 02:26:53,128
MATT: It takes a long time, man.

2106
02:26:53,128 --> 02:26:53,944
MARISHA: Fire!

2107
02:26:53,944 --> 02:26:58,321
MATT: Fire, all right. You create a potion of fire
resistance. The materials cost you 450 gold to

2108
02:26:58,321 --> 02:27:05,217
create, you finish it by about sunrise the next
day. Everyone else begins slowly waking up after

2109
02:27:05,217 --> 02:27:07,606
the night's rest as you guys both, bags under your
eyes.

2110
02:27:07,606 --> 02:27:11,635
LAURA: Oh, that was a good night's sleep, I tell
you what.

2111
02:27:11,635 --> 02:27:12,793
TRAVIS: Seriously.

2112
02:27:12,793 --> 02:27:13,666
SAM: Keyleth, could you--

2113
02:27:13,666 --> 02:27:15,467
MARISHA: What? Oh, god, you snuck up on me.

2114
02:27:15,467 --> 02:27:17,271
SAM: Could you make me some tea real quick?

2115
02:27:17,271 --> 02:27:18,392
MARISHA: Scanlan.

2116
02:27:18,392 --> 02:27:19,643
SAM: What?

2117
02:27:19,643 --> 02:27:21,209
MARISHA: Go fuck yourself.

2118
02:27:21,209 --> 02:27:22,644
SAM: What, you were up before me, I thought--

2119
02:27:22,644 --> 02:27:28,213
TALIESIN: All right. All right, this is fine.

2120
02:27:28,213 --> 02:27:29,437
MARISHA: This is fine.

2121
02:27:29,437 --> 02:27:30,276
TALIESIN: This is good.

2122
02:27:30,276 --> 02:27:31,129
MARISHA: This is great.

2123
02:27:31,129 --> 02:27:34,729
MATT: You're doing a Heroes' Feast for breakfast,
then? Is that how it's working?

2124
02:27:34,729 --> 02:27:40,353
MARISHA: I'll take a nap. I'll cook breakfast,
guys, good morning. Good morning!

2125
02:27:40,353 --> 02:27:41,813
LAURA: Oh hey, good morning, Keyleth!

2126
02:27:41,813 --> 02:27:45,608
SAM: Why don't you sleep during the day, we'll all
take our feast, and then blast off at night time?

2127
02:27:45,608 --> 02:27:50,516
MARISHA: Because I have to teleport and cooking
this feast are both 6th-level spells and I can

2128
02:27:50,516 --> 02:27:51,646
only do one of those a day.

2129
02:27:51,646 --> 02:27:53,211
TRAVIS: Man, it's hard being a druid.

2130
02:27:53,211 --> 02:27:55,367
LAURA: Can anybody else make a feast? That's
here?

2131
02:27:55,367 --> 02:27:57,819
MARISHA: Pike. Pike. Pike?

2132
02:27:57,819 --> 02:27:59,389
SAM: She's with Gilmore.

2133
02:27:59,389 --> 02:28:01,099
TRAVIS: She's not here.

2134
02:28:01,099 --> 02:28:04,698
LAURA: (sighs) I miss Pike.

2135
02:28:04,698 --> 02:28:07,657
LIAM: We all miss Pike.

2136
02:28:07,657 --> 02:28:10,128
MARISHA: I'll cook breakfast, guys.

2137
02:28:10,128 --> 02:28:13,085
LAURA: No, I'll cook breakfast. No, I won't cook
breakfast.

2138
02:28:13,085 --> 02:28:15,475
LIAM: That's a good idea, for you to not cook
breakfast.

2139
02:28:15,475 --> 02:28:16,609
MATT: What's the plan?

2140
02:28:16,609 --> 02:28:18,011
MARISHA: I'm cooking breakfast!

2141
02:28:18,011 --> 02:28:21,218
MATT: Are you cooking breakfast or are you
summoning breakfast? That's my question.

2142
02:28:21,218 --> 02:28:25,796
LAURA: Are you summoning breakfast and then you're
sleeping and then we're leaving?

2143
02:28:25,796 --> 02:28:29,197
MARISHA: I'm summoning-- yes, I'm summoning
breakfast and then I'm sleeping.

2144
02:28:29,197 --> 02:28:31,591
LAURA: And then you're sleeping and then we're
leaving as soon as you wake up.

2145
02:28:31,591 --> 02:28:36,420
MATT: Okay, that's what I was wondering. We got
the answer, okay, cool. Hoo, today's been a slog.

2146
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:43,870
All right, so you go ahead and you use Heroes'
Feast, summoning forth a fantastical breakfast meal

2147
02:28:43,870 --> 02:28:48,036
filled with coffee and eggs and everything you
would hope for, the finest materials.

2148
02:28:48,036 --> 02:28:50,180
LAURA: Froot Loops!

2149
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:53,159
MATT: (laughs) Sure, Froot Loops is on the menu,
why not?

2150
02:28:53,159 --> 02:28:54,460
TALIESIN: Lucky Charms.

2151
02:28:54,460 --> 02:29:00,157
MATT: No Lucky Charms, sorry, those aren't
available on Tal'Dorei. But yes, all you guys take

2152
02:29:00,157 --> 02:29:08,322
an hour to finish devouring this, you finish your
meal, all you guys get a 2d10 hit point maximum

2153
02:29:08,322 --> 02:29:10,055
increase to your hit points.

2154
02:29:10,055 --> 02:29:11,982
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, greens, greens!

2155
02:29:11,982 --> 02:29:17,037
MATT: And immune to poison, frightened, and all
wisdom saving throws have advantage.

2156
02:29:17,037 --> 02:29:18,867
TRAVIS: Damn!

2157
02:29:18,867 --> 02:29:23,426
SAM: Advantage on wisdom.

2158
02:29:23,426 --> 02:29:26,096
MATT: Yes, the usual.

2159
02:29:26,096 --> 02:29:27,574
TRAVIS: Almost broke.

2160
02:29:27,574 --> 02:29:28,871
MARISHA: And wisdom.

2161
02:29:28,871 --> 02:29:30,360
LAURA: And you're immune to fear, right?

2162
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:33,257
MARISHA: Immune to fear, poison, and what else?

2163
02:29:33,257 --> 02:29:35,568
MATT: And you get advantage on wisdom saving
throws.

2164
02:29:35,568 --> 02:29:36,508
SAM: Okay.

2165
02:29:36,508 --> 02:29:41,911
MATT: After which, Percy and Keyleth pretty much
fall asleep at the table as it vanishes and they

2166
02:29:41,911 --> 02:29:47,267
both collapse to the ground, eggs out of the
corner of their mouth. Eventually they make

2167
02:29:47,267 --> 02:29:50,938
themselves back up to sleep and the rest of you
guys peter around for the remainder of the day

2168
02:29:50,938 --> 02:29:56,943
while they get their full rest. It now comes to,
at the end of that eight-hour period of time, I'd

2169
02:29:56,943 --> 02:30:03,055
say about three, four in the afternoon before they
finally wake up. You've restored your spells.

2170
02:30:03,055 --> 02:30:03,918
MARISHA: Yay!

2171
02:30:03,918 --> 02:30:06,895
MATT: And the rest of you are ready to go about
your business.

2172
02:30:06,895 --> 02:30:08,405
LAURA: Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2173
02:30:08,405 --> 02:30:09,892
LIAM: Wait! While they're sleeping, right--

2174
02:30:09,892 --> 02:30:10,974
MATT: Mm-hmm?

2175
02:30:10,974 --> 02:30:12,622
LIAM: I take Scanlan aside.

2176
02:30:12,622 --> 02:30:13,642
MATT: Okay.

2177
02:30:13,642 --> 02:30:14,423
SAM: Oi.

2178
02:30:14,423 --> 02:30:15,466
LIAM: Hey, buddy.

2179
02:30:15,466 --> 02:30:16,495
SAM: Hey, friendo.

2180
02:30:16,495 --> 02:30:17,496
LIAM: Yeah.

2181
02:30:17,496 --> 02:30:19,890
SAM: What's up?

2182
02:30:19,890 --> 02:30:21,025
LIAM: We don't talk a lot.

2183
02:30:21,025 --> 02:30:23,597
SAM: Well, we start to and then you leave the
room, usually.

2184
02:30:23,597 --> 02:30:26,940
(laughter)

2185
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:31,406
LIAM: I don't handle personal emotional
confrontation very well.

2186
02:30:31,406 --> 02:30:33,182
SAM: It's okay. I walk away.

2187
02:30:33,182 --> 02:30:35,762
(laughter)

2188
02:30:35,762 --> 02:30:36,734
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

2189
02:30:36,734 --> 02:30:38,147
SAM: Then I come back, I feel bad.

2190
02:30:38,147 --> 02:30:39,560
TALIESIN: No, no, that was perfect.

2191
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:41,397
LIAM: Where did you go?

2192
02:30:41,397 --> 02:30:42,986
SAM: Just kidding, just kidding.

2193
02:30:42,986 --> 02:30:49,295
LIAM: Pull up a chair, sit down, I want to ask you
something.

2194
02:30:49,295 --> 02:30:51,073
SAM: I'm already as low as I can go.

2195
02:30:51,073 --> 02:30:55,910
LIAM: You're right. How do you do it?

2196
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:57,848
SAM: How do I do what?

2197
02:30:57,848 --> 02:31:02,186
LIAM: How do you do it? You're risking your life
as much as anyone in this group, you're almost

2198
02:31:02,186 --> 02:31:12,095
dying every day. You're fucking smiling all the
time. How do you do it? I'm kind of asking as Liam

2199
02:31:12,095 --> 02:31:19,715
to Sam as well, but mostly as Vax to Scanlan. How
do you do it? You almost died yesterday as well.

2200
02:31:19,715 --> 02:31:25,056
Or two days ago, fuck. Why do you do it?

2201
02:31:25,056 --> 02:31:35,865
SAM: Well, Vax. I don't know, I mean, I like you
people, okay? Everything before this was not as

2202
02:31:35,932 --> 02:31:43,362
good. This is better. That's why. It's very
simple. You had a shitty childhood, didn't you?

2203
02:31:43,362 --> 02:31:45,764
You and the sister?

2204
02:31:45,764 --> 02:31:47,186
LIAM: Yeah.

2205
02:31:47,186 --> 02:31:55,052
SAM: I think Grog had some troubles. We've all had
our share of shit before we all met. Now we're

2206
02:31:55,052 --> 02:32:00,459
together, we're a family, this is better. That's
how I smile. It's better than it was before.

2207
02:32:00,459 --> 02:32:02,744
That's it.

2208
02:32:02,744 --> 02:32:05,132
LIAM: We're probably going to die in the next
month.

2209
02:32:05,132 --> 02:32:07,372
SAM: Yes, but it's fun while it lasts.

2210
02:32:07,372 --> 02:32:16,942
LIAM: All right. Thought I might--

2211
02:32:16,942 --> 02:32:19,369
SAM: Glean some wisdom?

2212
02:32:19,369 --> 02:32:21,738
LIAM: Yeah, but I'm just as confused as before.

2213
02:32:21,738 --> 02:32:25,199
SAM: Listen, I'm older than you.

2214
02:32:25,199 --> 02:32:27,263
LIAM: How much older?

2215
02:32:27,263 --> 02:32:36,324
SAM: A bit. I've seen more than you have. And it's
all shitty, so it just depends on how you look at

2216
02:32:36,324 --> 02:32:44,641
it. You can dwell on the shit, or you can just
leave it behind in people's beds and keep going.

2217
02:32:44,641 --> 02:32:49,288
MARISHA: Oh god, that works on too many levels.

2218
02:32:49,288 --> 02:32:51,095
TALIESIN: Oh god, that's too deep.

2219
02:32:51,095 --> 02:32:52,213
MARISHA: Too deep.

2220
02:32:52,213 --> 02:32:54,518
LIAM: You did that. Water under the bridge.

2221
02:32:54,518 --> 02:32:57,233
SAM: I walk away.

2222
02:32:57,233 --> 02:33:03,825
LIAM: That little motherfucker shit in my bed.

2223
02:33:03,825 --> 02:33:14,570
MATT: All right. As you regather your will, path
chosen; Keyleth, do you wish to prepare the

2224
02:33:14,570 --> 02:33:16,281
transportation spell?

2225
02:33:16,281 --> 02:33:17,465
MARISHA: Yeah.

2226
02:33:17,465 --> 02:33:19,059
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

2227
02:33:19,059 --> 02:33:22,876
MATT: All right. All of you gather and find your
way down to the Sun Tree in the center of the

2228
02:33:22,876 --> 02:33:30,847
town. At this point, it's later afternoon, you've
been growing accustomed these past few days of

2229
02:33:30,847 --> 02:33:39,267
taking action right around dusk, and as the sky
turns from a blue to a bit of an orangish hue, you

2230
02:33:39,267 --> 02:33:47,262
all find yourselves ready to transition back over
to the continent of Issylra.

2231
02:33:47,262 --> 02:33:53,479
MARISHA: Let's go. To the Sun Tree.

2232
02:33:53,479 --> 02:33:58,016
MATT: Keyleth steps forward, touches her hand to
the Sun Tree, completes her mental incantation,

2233
02:33:58,016 --> 02:34:05,331
and you watch the trunk once again tear open into
the somewhat oval walkway into the tree itself. On

2234
02:34:05,331 --> 02:34:07,913
the opposite side, what's your destination?

2235
02:34:07,913 --> 02:34:15,095
MARISHA: Oh, god. As close as I can get to the
Fire Ashari, I guess.

2236
02:34:15,095 --> 02:34:24,237
MATT: Okay. You recall, passing through, there
were a number of trees towards the base of the

2237
02:34:24,237 --> 02:34:30,176
mountain that were starting to grow petrified from
the proximity to the ash that constantly falls

2238
02:34:30,176 --> 02:34:35,261
from the sky. They died a long time ago and are
slowly beginning to petrify. As the portal opens

2239
02:34:35,261 --> 02:34:43,054
up on the opposite side, you can see beyond that
the dark rock that formulates that mountain range.

2240
02:34:43,054 --> 02:34:48,085
At the same time, you can see a dull orange glow,
and you all begin to step through in rapid

2241
02:34:48,085 --> 02:34:54,459
succession, Trinket racing up after Vex. All of
you find yourself stepping out the other side, at

2242
02:34:54,459 --> 02:35:03,320
which point you look up and you can see the
pathway that you took towards the top of the

2243
02:35:03,320 --> 02:35:09,327
mountain where the Fire Ashari called Pyrah, where
they maintained their ever-vigilant watch on the

2244
02:35:09,327 --> 02:35:20,482
tear into the fire elemental plane. What you do
notice immediately is that the path that you took

2245
02:35:20,482 --> 02:35:29,905
initially is no longer a simple walkway. Against
the now very dark sky, this side of the realm

2246
02:35:29,905 --> 02:35:37,279
itself, night is, actually, no, sorry. At this
point, you've actually beaten the sun.

2247
02:35:37,279 --> 02:35:40,144
MARISHA: Oh, do we gain a few hours?

2248
02:35:40,144 --> 02:35:41,473
MATT: Yeah, you guys have gained a few hours,
technically.

2249
02:35:41,473 --> 02:35:42,969
MARISHA: Awesome.

2250
02:35:42,969 --> 02:35:45,620
MATT: So it's still light in the sky from other
parts in the distance, however, there is a

2251
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:54,163
perpetual dark cloud of smoke and actual storm
cloud gathering across this mountain range. As you

2252
02:35:54,163 --> 02:35:58,430
recall the first time you were here, that's the
nature of Pyrah, it's always under this thick,

2253
02:35:58,430 --> 02:36:03,855
heavy, soot-and-ash-filled cloud cover. The
pathway that winds up the mountain, though, is

2254
02:36:03,855 --> 02:36:12,159
instead a glowing orange mass of slowly dribbling
molten rock that has filled that entire walkway,

2255
02:36:12,159 --> 02:36:17,132
and it has come to rest at the base of the
mountain where it has gathered and begun to cool.

2256
02:36:17,132 --> 02:36:25,271
You guys are hundreds of feet off from this point
as you step out of the tree. However, where you

2257
02:36:25,271 --> 02:36:33,055
see the molten rock has reached the base of the
mountain, you-- it's cooled and formed into solid

2258
02:36:33,055 --> 02:36:39,094
rock at its base, and you start seeing flashes of
the orange turning dark, then another section

2259
02:36:39,094 --> 02:36:45,405
turns dark from the opposite side. And then a few
moments pass and you can see the orange of the

2260
02:36:45,405 --> 02:36:58,526
next section, up in like ten-foot segments, it's
going dark and hardening on its own. You get the

2261
02:36:58,526 --> 02:37:04,853
sense that your arrival did not trigger this more
than it has been happening since

2262
02:37:04,853 --> 02:37:06,522
before you arrived.

2263
02:37:06,522 --> 02:37:09,979
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to figure out
what's up?

2264
02:37:09,979 --> 02:37:15,524
MATT: Sure. Actually, this would be a perception
check to see if you can ascertain.

2265
02:37:15,524 --> 02:37:19,820
MARISHA: 16.

2266
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:27,471
MATT: 16. It's difficult to make out at this
distance, but you can see, along portions of the

2267
02:37:27,471 --> 02:37:36,257
jagged mountainside, a collection of small figures
that are making their way up the mountain, and

2268
02:37:36,257 --> 02:37:43,500
their slow ascent is met with the lava flow
cooling in sections.

2269
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:45,918
MARISHA: Do they look like people, like
humanoids?

2270
02:37:45,918 --> 02:37:51,328
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance, they
look human-ish, humanoid-ish.

2271
02:37:51,328 --> 02:37:54,026
TALIESIN: I attempt to use the optics on my gun to
get a better look at them.

2272
02:37:54,026 --> 02:37:57,468
MATT: Sure, go ahead and make a perception check.

2273
02:37:57,468 --> 02:38:02,505
TALIESIN: 18.

2274
02:38:02,505 --> 02:38:10,308
MATT: 18. A little bit of a clearer look through,
they do appear to be humanoid. You do see two

2275
02:38:10,308 --> 02:38:15,379
arms, two legs. You can't gauge size comparison
from this distance.

2276
02:38:15,379 --> 02:38:17,266
SAM: How far?

2277
02:38:17,266 --> 02:38:22,719
MATT: At this point, they're probably a good 800
feet up the mountain.

2278
02:38:22,719 --> 02:38:25,211
MARISHA: 800 feet?

2279
02:38:25,211 --> 02:38:28,769
TALIESIN: Are they dressed like the Ashari that
I've met?

2280
02:38:28,769 --> 02:38:35,692
MATT: From what you can make out, their color
palette shifts, there are reds and browns, some

2281
02:38:35,692 --> 02:38:45,564
stand out as an aquamarine white. The Ashari you
saw were a pretty consistent color palette. This

2282
02:38:45,564 --> 02:38:47,206
is a little more varied.

2283
02:38:47,206 --> 02:38:48,760
TALIESIN: I don't know who these people are.

2284
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:54,646
MARISHA: They could still be Ashari. Just in their
elemental forms. Are there any birds around? I

2285
02:38:54,646 --> 02:38:56,349
look up, do I see birds in the sky?

2286
02:38:56,349 --> 02:39:01,772
MATT: There are no birds in the sky.
Unfortunately, because of the nature of this area,

2287
02:39:01,772 --> 02:39:08,830
especially as the oppressive fumes and dust
continue to pour off from the top of the caldera

2288
02:39:08,830 --> 02:39:12,518
of this mountain range, it has made it not fitting
for any sort of aerial life that you're used to

2289
02:39:12,518 --> 02:39:17,669
seeing. You glance around for about a minute or
two and you don't see any sort of bird life in the air.

2290
02:39:17,669 --> 02:39:24,654
TRAVIS: Did the ground cool where they were
walking? Could we follow them up?

2291
02:39:24,654 --> 02:39:26,157
TALIESIN: We should.

2292
02:39:26,157 --> 02:39:32,856
MARISHA: Let's stay far behind. Let's go quietly.

2293
02:39:32,856 --> 02:39:35,326
LAURA: Let's walk. Stealth? I cast Pass Without a
Trace on all of us.

2294
02:39:35,326 --> 02:39:38,747
MATT: Okay. Everyone make a stealth check,
including Trinket.

2295
02:39:38,747 --> 02:39:42,232
TRAVIS: You don't want to put him in the thing?

2296
02:39:42,232 --> 02:39:43,874
SAM: You could.

2297
02:39:43,874 --> 02:39:45,088
LAURA: (gasps) Okay.

2298
02:39:45,088 --> 02:39:46,293
LIAM: Try it out.

2299
02:39:46,293 --> 02:39:48,983
LAURA: I put it on a string so I could put it
around my neck because it's a necklace because

2300
02:39:48,983 --> 02:39:50,389
it's cooler that way.

2301
02:39:50,389 --> 02:39:52,193
MATT: Well, it has a chain on it that it came
with.

2302
02:39:52,193 --> 02:39:53,633
LAURA: It's got a chain on it, so it's around my
neck.

2303
02:39:53,633 --> 02:39:54,970
MATT: All right, so you take it, you put--

2304
02:39:54,970 --> 02:39:56,467
SAM: It has a chain and a string now.

2305
02:39:56,467 --> 02:39:57,945
MATT: Chain and string.

2306
02:39:57,945 --> 02:39:59,974
MARISHA: The string's so you don't forget.

2307
02:39:59,974 --> 02:40:04,289
MATT: Exactly. You trigger the necklace, pointing
it in the direction of Trinket, and once again

2308
02:40:04,289 --> 02:40:09,777
Trinket is absorbed into the crystal, vanishing
within the inside. All right.

2309
02:40:09,777 --> 02:40:12,662
TRAVIS: 17.

2310
02:40:12,662 --> 02:40:14,112
MATT: 17.

2311
02:40:14,112 --> 02:40:16,662
SAM: Pass Without a Trace is--?

2312
02:40:16,662 --> 02:40:19,313
TRAVIS: Plus ten. I rolled shitty.

2313
02:40:19,313 --> 02:40:20,617
LAURA: 30.

2314
02:40:20,617 --> 02:40:21,788
LIAM: 35.

2315
02:40:21,788 --> 02:40:22,880
MARISHA: 32.

2316
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:23,807
TALIESIN: 29.

2317
02:40:23,807 --> 02:40:25,069
SAM: 25.

2318
02:40:25,069 --> 02:40:33,042
MATT: Okay. You guys begin making your trek up.
How are you going up the mountain? Are you scaling

2319
02:40:33,042 --> 02:40:34,939
the cooled flow?

2320
02:40:34,939 --> 02:40:36,116
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

2321
02:40:36,116 --> 02:40:40,070
MATT: That's probably the safest route given the
fact that most of the other side of the mountain

2322
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:46,660
range itself is pretty jagged, and elements of it,
because of the formation of this giant volcanic

2323
02:40:46,660 --> 02:40:51,381
caldera, there are portions of broken stone and
obsidian glass that sticks out the side.

2324
02:40:51,381 --> 02:41:03,279
MARISHA: As we're walking up, I fall behind
and I slip Vax the potion of fire protection.

2325
02:41:03,279 --> 02:41:16,867
MATT: All right. You guys continue in pace with
this, eventually, and make

2326
02:41:16,867 --> 02:41:19,765
another perception check?

2327
02:41:19,765 --> 02:41:25,932
MARISHA: Much better, that's a natural 19. 30.

2328
02:41:25,932 --> 02:41:32,966
MATT: 30. Okay. Looking up, as this cluster of
individuals makes their way towards the very top

2329
02:41:32,966 --> 02:41:40,471
of the mountain, seemingly not taking sight of
your traveling group, you're beginning to see the

2330
02:41:40,471 --> 02:41:46,273
nature of each section of this flow cooling. And
what you're seeing is the group will move up a

2331
02:41:46,273 --> 02:41:56,253
bit, stop, and there appears to be a burst of--
sometimes it looks like very strong wind, sometimes

2332
02:41:56,253 --> 02:42:03,808
it looks like a very localized sleet storm that is
brought against the side of the mountain and is

2333
02:42:03,808 --> 02:42:09,219
actually forcefully cooling the flow down
temporarily, at least in those sections, before it

2334
02:42:09,219 --> 02:42:13,890
begins to spill over and continue its slow molten
descent, but they're doing their best to continue

2335
02:42:13,890 --> 02:42:16,504
to force it back up the mountain and--

2336
02:42:16,504 --> 02:42:18,623
LAURA and MARISHA: Those are druids.

2337
02:42:18,623 --> 02:42:24,389
MARISHA: I cast Skywrite in the clouds above us,
in the smoke.

2338
02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:25,706
MATT: Okay.

2339
02:42:25,706 --> 02:42:28,510
MARISHA: And I write--

2340
02:42:28,510 --> 02:42:31,801
LAURA: "So, how are you guys doing up there?"

2341
02:42:31,801 --> 02:42:33,512
TALIESIN: "Hi."

2342
02:42:33,512 --> 02:42:45,107
MARISHA: "Hi. Hey you guys." I write, in druidic
symbols, "Keyleth, Kaitiaki."

2343
02:42:45,107 --> 02:42:49,769
SAM: What's that? Is that her?

2344
02:42:49,769 --> 02:43:01,120
MATT: Okay. You notice the pace in which this
group has ascended comes to a halt at the very,

2345
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:08,191
very top of the mountain range where it ends, and
there's a slight pause before the clouds shift a

2346
02:43:08,191 --> 02:43:19,762
second time and it says, from what you understand,
"Kaitiaki. Survivors remain, Keyleth."

2347
02:43:19,762 --> 02:43:26,004
MARISHA: And I respond with, "Help has arrived."

2348
02:43:26,004 --> 02:43:29,006
SAM: You guys are texting?

2349
02:43:29,006 --> 02:43:30,251
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

2350
02:43:30,251 --> 02:43:32,016
MATT: Druid texting.

2351
02:43:32,016 --> 02:43:34,412
LAURA: What are you saying?

2352
02:43:34,412 --> 02:43:35,914
TALIESIN: Stop looking at your phone.

2353
02:43:35,914 --> 02:43:37,632
LAURA: What do they say?

2354
02:43:37,632 --> 02:43:39,286
SAM: Why don't we go over there and talk to them?

2355
02:43:39,286 --> 02:43:40,535
MARISHA: They're survivors.

2356
02:43:40,535 --> 02:43:41,954
TRAVIS: Well, let's go.

2357
02:43:41,954 --> 02:43:43,271
LAURA: Are they nice?

2358
02:43:43,271 --> 02:43:46,574
MARISHA: They're survivors. What does it matter?

2359
02:43:46,574 --> 02:43:48,925
TRAVIS: And we go.

2360
02:43:48,925 --> 02:43:56,623
MARISHA: Let's go. And I tell them, you know,
"Arriving. Stand down. Here we come."

2361
02:43:56,623 --> 02:43:57,724
TALIESIN: "Lol."

2362
02:43:57,724 --> 02:43:59,453
MARISHA: "Lol. Winky-face."

2363
02:43:59,453 --> 02:44:06,492
LIAM: As we travel, because I was too out of it to
respond and she's way ahead, I take the potion

2364
02:44:06,492 --> 02:44:10,001
that Keyleth gave to me, because she didn't have
to, I've got the David Bowie armor on now.

2365
02:44:10,001 --> 02:44:11,810
MATT: You did don it. Okay.

2366
02:44:11,810 --> 02:44:13,414
LIAM: Yes, yeah. Before going to bed.

2367
02:44:13,414 --> 02:44:14,434
MARISHA: Oh you did, okay.

2368
02:44:14,434 --> 02:44:16,832
LIAM: And I press it into Vex's hand.

2369
02:44:16,832 --> 02:44:19,404
MATT: Okay.

2370
02:44:19,404 --> 02:44:23,958
LAURA: Hey, I took your, all right, I'm going to
take it.

2371
02:44:23,958 --> 02:44:29,436
MATT: What was your choice of resistance? I assume
it was fire. Okay. All right. As you guys progress

2372
02:44:29,436 --> 02:44:35,067
up, and it is, though it is a safe route, it is
still a relatively steep incline and you're all

2373
02:44:35,067 --> 02:44:40,124
having to work together to find handholds, and it
is very arduous physically getting up there. I

2374
02:44:40,124 --> 02:44:44,657
would like everyone to go ahead and make a constitution
saving throw.

2375
02:44:44,657 --> 02:44:45,942
SAM: Oh, shit.

2376
02:44:45,942 --> 02:44:47,425
LAURA: A constitution?

2377
02:44:47,425 --> 02:44:48,400
MATT: Yes.

2378
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:50,279
LAURA: Oh, do we get advantage because of the
feast?

2379
02:44:50,279 --> 02:44:51,468
TRAVIS: No, that's only wisdom.

2380
02:44:51,468 --> 02:44:52,486
LAURA: Shit.

2381
02:44:52,486 --> 02:44:54,515
LIAM: Come on, Colville meteorite die.

2382
02:44:54,515 --> 02:44:55,633
TRAVIS: 17.

2383
02:44:55,633 --> 02:44:56,666
LIAM: I'm so weak.

2384
02:44:56,666 --> 02:44:57,884
LAURA: Come on, jade.

2385
02:44:57,884 --> 02:44:59,225
LIAM: Natural 20!

2386
02:44:59,225 --> 02:45:00,275
LAURA: You motherfucker!

2387
02:45:00,275 --> 02:45:01,428
LIAM: Thank you, Matthew Colville.

2388
02:45:01,428 --> 02:45:03,140
LAURA: I'm rolling my giant jade dice, because
it's green.

2389
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:05,277
TRAVIS: Way to announce it.

2390
02:45:05,277 --> 02:45:12,438
LAURA: Womp-womp. Oh, that's a six.

2391
02:45:12,438 --> 02:45:14,267
TRAVIS: (laughs) You're fucked.

2392
02:45:14,267 --> 02:45:15,496
MARISHA: 20.

2393
02:45:15,496 --> 02:45:16,534
TALIESIN: 13.

2394
02:45:16,534 --> 02:45:17,576
SAM: Five.

2395
02:45:17,576 --> 02:45:23,469
MATT: Okay. As you guys begin to get partially up
the mountain, the proximity of the heat from the--

2396
02:45:23,469 --> 02:45:26,446
because the exterior of the rock has cooled, but
it's still molten beneath and there are

2397
02:45:26,446 --> 02:45:31,253
parts of that are still cracking open, and bits of
the heat are still pouring through, plus the

2398
02:45:31,302 --> 02:45:37,036
general physical exertion from the not-very-hardy
physiques of both Vex and Scanlan, you both suffer

2399
02:45:37,036 --> 02:45:40,793
one level of exhaustion from the ascent up the
side of this mountain.

2400
02:45:40,793 --> 02:45:43,537
LAURA: Oh, Trinket's in his thing, he's not
worried at all.

2401
02:45:43,537 --> 02:45:46,630
TALIESIN: I don't actually know what one level of
exhaustion is.

2402
02:45:46,630 --> 02:45:50,666
MATT: You guys have disadvantage on ability
checks. All your skill checks right now, until

2403
02:45:50,666 --> 02:45:52,607
your next long rest, are at disadvantage.

2404
02:45:52,607 --> 02:45:54,300
TRAVIS: Levels of exhaustion suck.

2405
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:56,691
SAM: Not saving.

2406
02:45:56,691 --> 02:46:03,176
MATT: However, as you guys are approaching towards
the top, you can see now the humanoids that were at

2407
02:46:03,176 --> 02:46:07,995
the top of this mountain crest have been since
keeping the flow at bay and each time it begins to

2408
02:46:07,995 --> 02:46:12,223
crest over again and continue its flow, it's
blasted again from the side and cools and it's

2409
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:15,461
building this very, very slow gradual
outcropping--

2410
02:46:15,461 --> 02:46:22,376
MARISHA: I use my cantrip Gust and cool areas
alongside as we ascend.

2411
02:46:22,376 --> 02:46:26,406
MATT: Okay. You glance up and you now have a
better view of this group, and what you do see

2412
02:46:26,406 --> 02:46:34,189
ahead of you, specifically Keyleth, appears to be
a cluster of about eight or so Fire Ashari-dressed

2413
02:46:34,189 --> 02:46:42,152
individuals. You can't make out their physical
details yet. Along with five other entities that

2414
02:46:42,152 --> 02:46:47,258
are dressed in the colors and vestments of those
from Zephrah.

2415
02:46:47,258 --> 02:46:50,433
MARISHA: Oh shit!

2416
02:46:50,433 --> 02:46:52,060
TRAVIS: From who? From what?

2417
02:46:52,060 --> 02:46:53,656
LIAM: What's the matter?

2418
02:46:53,656 --> 02:46:55,268
LAURA: What's up? What's happening?

2419
02:46:55,268 --> 02:46:58,509
MARISHA: I run up.

2420
02:46:58,509 --> 02:47:01,020
MATT: Keyleth goes running up.

2421
02:47:01,020 --> 02:47:04,570
MARISHA: You said seven or eight from 
Zephrah?

2422
02:47:04,570 --> 02:47:08,105
MATT: There are five from Zephrah.

2423
02:47:08,105 --> 02:47:11,012
LAURA: Are we going to, we're going to follow?

2424
02:47:11,012 --> 02:47:13,001
LIAM: Yeah, I'm breaking out of stealth and
running.

2425
02:47:13,001 --> 02:47:16,564
TALIESIN: Ah. Yeah. No. We're running now.

2426
02:47:16,564 --> 02:47:22,190
LAURA: I walk. I'm pretty tired. You and me. Let's
just walk.

2427
02:47:22,190 --> 02:47:24,430
SAM: Yeah. You can carry me.

2428
02:47:24,430 --> 02:47:25,893
TALIESIN: Cardio. God.

2429
02:47:25,893 --> 02:47:29,647
MATT: Okay, it takes a while to get up there. As
you guys begin to approach, a little bit behind

2430
02:47:29,647 --> 02:47:39,511
Keyleth, and you look, you see the only two
notable Fire Ashari that you see there are

2431
02:47:39,511 --> 02:47:46,472
Nastoen, which is a human female that you saw was
one of the four that first greeted you as you

2432
02:47:46,472 --> 02:47:51,397
approached Pyrah when you got to the mountaintop.
She looks a little rough, but she's definitely in

2433
02:47:51,397 --> 02:47:57,907
one piece. The other one that greets you, and
immediately you recognize as Flamespeaker

2434
02:47:57,907 --> 02:48:10,511
Cerkonos, who currently does not have his right
arm. It is charred and is, through some semblance

2435
02:48:10,511 --> 02:48:16,940
of flame, cauterized to where he no longer has a
shoulder and part of his torso is a black mass of

2436
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:22,921
burnt skin, probably intentionally, but as you
approach he puts his hand out and goes,

2437
02:48:22,921 --> 02:48:25,385
"Hail, Keyleth."

2438
02:48:25,385 --> 02:48:30,060
MARISHA: Hail, Cerkonos. And I run up and give him
a hug.

2439
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:38,012
MATT: He pats you on the back and there's a
coldness to his look, his expression. You can see

2440
02:48:38,012 --> 02:48:43,415
in a brief instant, though there is strength and
determination, there is a moment as he looks into

2441
02:48:43,415 --> 02:48:46,182
your face that you can see the sorrow of losing
most of his people.

2442
02:48:46,182 --> 02:48:50,812
MARISHA: And I look back at him and I say: I'm so
sorry.

2443
02:48:50,812 --> 02:49:05,098
MATT: "This is not your fault. We had this coming.
We are the able-bodied few you see."

2444
02:49:05,098 --> 02:49:09,493
MARISHA: Are these all that have survived?

2445
02:49:09,493 --> 02:49:20,558
MATT: "We are 25 living. The rest reside at the
base of the mountain, to be watched, or are the

2446
02:49:20,558 --> 02:49:31,167
"watchers. But our attrition is of our own making.
We helped outsiders too long ago."

2447
02:49:31,167 --> 02:49:39,835
MARISHA: What? What do you mean, like, how long
ago? 12, 15 years?

2448
02:49:39,835 --> 02:49:43,050
MATT: "We helped seal a drake in this rift."

2449
02:49:43,050 --> 02:49:45,974
LAURA: Thordak.

2450
02:49:45,974 --> 02:49:54,990
MATT: "That is the name they call him. We helped
bring and bind the beast to this rift, sealing

2451
02:49:54,990 --> 02:50:05,801
"within it the heart of a primordial flame, one of
the few pure essence crystals of our plane. Such a

2452
02:50:05,801 --> 02:50:12,438
"binding will not allow it to leave. It is a
punishment for the most terrible of evils that the

2453
02:50:12,438 --> 02:50:22,556
"Ashari take under their order. We carved from the
crystal in bind. This beast was too strong and

2454
02:50:22,556 --> 02:50:30,588
"took the entire crystal, but it seemed enough. It
seemed enough."

2455
02:50:30,588 --> 02:50:41,762
MARISHA: Cerkonos, it's not your fault. There are
greater forces at work here, beyond us. That's

2456
02:50:41,762 --> 02:50:47,504
something that I am desperately trying to reassure
myself of every day.

2457
02:50:47,504 --> 02:50:59,210
MATT: And a voice comes up from over the mountain
range, raspy, older, and with a casual importance

2458
02:50:59,210 --> 02:51:10,387
to it, and it says, "So, are you claiming some
semblance of dealing with this?" And as it steps

2459
02:51:10,387 --> 02:51:19,809
over, the face looks down with recognition. "My
god. Keyleth."

2460
02:51:19,809 --> 02:51:22,714
MARISHA: Who are you?

2461
02:51:22,714 --> 02:51:31,206
MATT: You guys look up and you see long,
silver-haired half-elf in later years dressed in

2462
02:51:31,254 --> 02:51:46,251
the blue and white robes of the Air Ashari. You
see before you Korren, your father. "You live."

2463
02:51:46,251 --> 02:51:48,921
MARISHA: Dad!

2464
02:51:48,921 --> 02:51:54,966
MATT: He steps forward and goes in, as he steps
away from Cerkonos, takes you in his arms and

2465
02:51:54,966 --> 02:51:58,769
holds you extremely tight against him.

2466
02:51:58,769 --> 02:52:07,501
MARISHA: I'm sorry I didn't check in sooner. I
didn't want you to be disappointed.

2467
02:52:07,501 --> 02:52:11,839
MATT: "Shh." He puts his finger up to your lips,
holds you back and looks you over and with a smile

2468
02:52:11,839 --> 02:52:19,481
on his face, you can see the hardness of his
expression fade. "Keyleth, you've grown."

2469
02:52:19,481 --> 02:52:23,473
MARISHA: A lot's happened.

2470
02:52:23,473 --> 02:52:29,521
MATT: "You look just like her."

2471
02:52:29,521 --> 02:52:32,666
MARISHA: I haven't found Mom.

2472
02:52:32,666 --> 02:52:42,329
MATT: "Her path was her own. I'm just glad that
you have maintained yours." He wipes the tear from

2473
02:52:42,329 --> 02:52:44,699
your face and says, "How goes the Aramente?"

2474
02:52:44,699 --> 02:52:47,370
MARISHA: Well.

2475
02:52:47,370 --> 02:52:50,141
LAURA: She's kicking ass.

2476
02:52:50,141 --> 02:53:03,829
MATT: "Good. Good." And he places his thumb at the
corner of his eye. "We were called naught but a

2477
02:53:03,829 --> 02:53:10,314
"day ago by the surviving Pyrah. Told of the angry
mountain and the terrible drake that sundered the

2478
02:53:10,314 --> 02:53:17,100
"rift. I helmed the team while the majority of our
people stayed to keep Zephrah cloaked and safe

2479
02:53:17,100 --> 02:53:24,695
"from the marauding beast. We've only just made our
way up the mountain. Your arrival is quite

2480
02:53:24,695 --> 02:53:28,428
"fortuitous, as we need all the help we can get."

2481
02:53:28,428 --> 02:53:30,991
SAM: How can we be of assistance?

2482
02:53:30,991 --> 02:53:40,986
MATT: "Come. See what remains of Pyrah." He turns
around and walks back over towards the top of the

2483
02:53:40,986 --> 02:53:42,007
mountain.

2484
02:53:42,007 --> 02:53:43,310
MARISHA: Daddy.

2485
02:53:43,310 --> 02:53:46,576
MATT: He stops. Looks over his shoulder towards
you. "Yes?"

2486
02:53:46,576 --> 02:53:51,394
MARISHA: It's good to see you again, father.

2487
02:53:51,394 --> 02:54:02,435
MATT: "It's good to see you as well, daughter. Now
come. Show me what you've learned." Goes back to

2488
02:54:02,435 --> 02:54:10,073
walking. The rest of the Fire Ashari stand up,
acknowledge and recognize those of you that stand

2489
02:54:10,073 --> 02:54:18,864
here before, visiting once before. Cerkonos looks
about. "You show strength and honor by coming here

2490
02:54:18,864 --> 02:54:28,458
"in our time of need. This will not be forgotten.
Now come." As you follow them up over the top of

2491
02:54:28,458 --> 02:54:32,619
the mountain, you see once again before you the
caldera of this once-volcanic mountain has been

2492
02:54:32,619 --> 02:54:39,732
blown apart in areas. You can see sections of
large black stone that are now pushed up into

2493
02:54:39,732 --> 02:54:48,424
jagged obelisks where once was a relatively smooth
blackened shale countryside. You can see there are

2494
02:54:48,424 --> 02:54:55,481
pits of molten rock that have been punched through
the floor and have gathered into these pools where

2495
02:54:55,481 --> 02:55:02,522
the air above is slowly shifting and warped by the
heat that is now released above the mountaintop.

2496
02:55:02,522 --> 02:55:08,524
The flow of lava that descends down the side of
this mountain continues and swells and heads

2497
02:55:08,524 --> 02:55:13,832
inward towards the Cindergrove. The Cindergrove,
from what you can see from this distance, is but a

2498
02:55:13,832 --> 02:55:20,605
fraction of what was once there, most of the trees
now torn apart and scattered amongst the top of

2499
02:55:20,605 --> 02:55:27,013
this mountain. You can see bits and pieces of the
various petrified trees thrown hundreds of feet

2500
02:55:27,013 --> 02:55:33,010
from the center. There are still standing, defiant
trees amongst what once was the Cindergrove, but

2501
02:55:33,010 --> 02:55:38,636
they are very sparse, many of them now blackened
by what you can see in the very distance beyond

2502
02:55:38,636 --> 02:55:47,325
the broken huts and homes that once held the
Pyrah, you can see in the distance moving, glowing

2503
02:55:47,325 --> 02:55:56,520
dots of various elemental energies spiraling
outward from a very large central red rift that

2504
02:55:56,520 --> 02:56:03,873
sits there pulsing and pulsing with bright, almost
sunlight energy. It's like staring into the sun at

2505
02:56:03,873 --> 02:56:08,920
the very zenith of its movement. You have to avert
your eyes even staring towards this rift, now a

2506
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:14,469
good 30, 40 feet taller than it was when you last
returned here. What was once the portal in the

2507
02:56:14,469 --> 02:56:19,136
ground has now ruptured and is emerging, slowly
piercing out of the top of this mountain.

2508
02:56:19,136 --> 02:56:27,092
Undaunted, your father and the other Ashari
continue walking forward with no words.

2509
02:56:27,092 --> 02:56:44,491
LAURA: I rush forward a little bit to talk to him.
Question. Your majesty? I want to help, we all

2510
02:56:44,491 --> 02:56:51,638
want to help as much as possible, but I don't know
any magic. Most of us don't. Are we going to be

2511
02:56:51,638 --> 02:56:53,478
able to do anything?

2512
02:56:53,478 --> 02:57:00,031
MATT: "Well, I certainly hope so. If you've
survived this long with my daughter, you've picked

2513
02:57:00,031 --> 02:57:01,545
"up a few tricks."

2514
02:57:01,545 --> 02:57:03,186
LAURA: Well, that I have.

2515
02:57:03,186 --> 02:57:11,420
MARISHA: Father, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
for these people. They are the most capable

2516
02:57:11,420 --> 02:57:12,962
that I know.

2517
02:57:12,962 --> 02:57:16,505
MATT: "This is good. Because that's who we need
right now."

2518
02:57:16,505 --> 02:57:29,785
MARISHA: However, since we're druids, we're a
little bit more, you know. Geared. Prepared to

2519
02:57:29,785 --> 02:57:37,368
deal with the fire. I can cast Protection from
Energy on a couple of these people, if you

2520
02:57:37,368 --> 02:57:40,907
wouldn't mind maybe grabbing the other two?

2521
02:57:40,907 --> 02:57:44,190
MATT: "I will do what I can."

2522
02:57:44,190 --> 02:57:53,503
MARISHA: And I cast Protection from Fire on Percy,
you have it, you have it, do you have it?

2523
02:57:53,503 --> 02:57:56,579
TRAVIS: Well, I really don't even know what I'm
going to do here.

2524
02:57:56,579 --> 02:57:58,737
MARISHA: Well, it's going to protect you from
fire.

2525
02:57:58,737 --> 02:58:01,070
TRAVIS: Okay.

2526
02:58:01,070 --> 02:58:02,546
MARISHA: Scanlan?

2527
02:58:02,546 --> 02:58:03,984
SAM: Hit me, babe.

2528
02:58:03,984 --> 02:58:09,183
MARISHA: I'll do Percy and Scanlan. Father, can
you--?

2529
02:58:09,183 --> 02:58:12,819
MATT: It's a concentration spell, so you can only
really have one person going, and that's your

2530
02:58:12,819 --> 02:58:13,951
concentration.

2531
02:58:13,951 --> 02:58:15,532
MARISHA: Can only have one person going.

2532
02:58:15,532 --> 02:58:16,422
MATT: Yep.

2533
02:58:16,422 --> 02:58:17,289
TRAVIS: Well, good.

2534
02:58:17,289 --> 02:58:19,882
MARISHA: I could cast it at higher levels. Can I
cast it at higher levels?

2535
02:58:19,882 --> 02:58:21,022
TRAVIS: I'll take a mulligan on this one.

2536
02:58:21,022 --> 02:58:22,489
MARISHA: Can't do that with this one? Fuck.

2537
02:58:22,489 --> 02:58:24,118
LAURA: Do Scanlan. Do Scanlan.

2538
02:58:24,118 --> 02:58:25,508
SAM: No, I'm fine, don't worry about me.

2539
02:58:25,508 --> 02:58:31,379
MARISHA: Well, I'm going to cast it on myself, for
starters. Because I want it.

2540
02:58:31,379 --> 02:58:32,399
LAURA: All right.

2541
02:58:32,399 --> 02:58:36,972
MARISHA: So I'm going to cast Protection from Fire
on myself.

2542
02:58:36,972 --> 02:58:39,165
LAURA: What does a potion of fire resistance do?

2543
02:58:39,165 --> 02:58:40,180
LIAM: Halves.

2544
02:58:40,180 --> 02:58:41,195
LAURA: The same thing?

2545
02:58:41,195 --> 02:58:42,722
LAURA and MARISHA: Halves all fire damage?

2546
02:58:42,722 --> 02:58:43,829
LAURA: Okay.

2547
02:58:43,829 --> 02:58:51,792
MATT: All right. As the cluster of you begin
stepping deeper into the caldera, you begin to

2548
02:58:51,792 --> 02:58:59,954
approach the outskirts of the remnants of the
Pyrah tribe's homestead. You can see where most of

2549
02:58:59,954 --> 02:59:07,182
it has been either completely burnt to a cinder or
lies tattered by some great force, shattered. And

2550
02:59:07,182 --> 02:59:12,002
you start, as you're walking through, you can see
where the landscape itself, all the jagged bits of

2551
02:59:12,002 --> 02:59:17,267
black obsidian glass are shooting up out of the
ground and there's broken pieces of the dark rock

2552
02:59:17,267 --> 02:59:22,001
and volcanic material, and it isn't until your
eyes begin to focus that you realize that elements

2553
02:59:22,001 --> 02:59:27,901
of this rock is not rock at all but the twisted
and charred remains of the Pyrah that didn't

2554
02:59:27,901 --> 02:59:35,958
escape in time, blending in with the ground and
landscape surrounding. The rest of the Ashari

2555
02:59:35,958 --> 02:59:41,673
continue pushing forward, not taking notice,
focused, as before you, you can see the rift,

2556
02:59:41,673 --> 02:59:47,939
still blinking ever-bright, in the center of the
remains of the Cindergrove. You steel yourselves.

2557
02:59:47,939 --> 02:59:57,786
MARISHA: I turn and I look at them and nod and
follow in my people's footsteps.

2558
02:59:57,786 --> 03:00:00,995
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's
session.

2559
03:00:00,995 --> 03:00:02,582
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh shit.

2560
03:00:02,582 --> 03:00:06,778
TRAVIS: Okay. We're cooking with gas now.

2561
03:00:06,778 --> 03:00:08,750
LAURA: As Marisha collapses in a pool of tears.

2562
03:00:08,750 --> 03:00:11,177
TALIESIN: Cry more, cry more!

2563
03:00:11,177 --> 03:00:13,454
MATT: You knew this was coming.

2564
03:00:13,454 --> 03:00:20,421
LAURA: Yeah, man. You're going to have a headache
tomorrow, dude.

2565
03:00:20,421 --> 03:00:23,060
MARISHA: I'm so tired. I'm tired.

2566
03:00:23,060 --> 03:00:27,260
LAURA: Aw, we've got exhaustion, Sam. That's
balls.

2567
03:00:27,260 --> 03:00:29,283
SAM: Yeah, that's not great.

2568
03:00:29,283 --> 03:00:32,785
LIAM: Thanks for tuning in to Therapy Thursday,
everyone.

2569
03:00:32,785 --> 03:00:36,507
TRAVIS: Where we take shits and talk to swords.

2570
03:00:36,507 --> 03:00:38,509
LAURA: There you go.

2571
03:00:38,509 --> 03:00:41,235
MATT: Got a little bit of column A, little bit of
column B, we got some drama, we got some personal

2572
03:00:41,235 --> 03:00:48,189
issues, we got some reunions, we got some
hardships, we got--

2573
03:00:48,189 --> 03:00:49,292
TALIESIN: Wild animals.

2574
03:00:49,292 --> 03:00:51,315
LAURA: Yeah, so many things!

2575
03:00:51,315 --> 03:00:54,809
MATT: And a travel method for Trinket.

2576
03:00:54,809 --> 03:00:57,225
LAURA: Oh my god, I'm so excited about it!

2577
03:00:57,225 --> 03:00:59,954
MATT: I wasn't sure how you guys were going to use
that one, as soon as you mentioned it I was like,

2578
03:00:59,954 --> 03:01:06,950
all right, that's what they're doing. That's a way
to do it. Yeah. Well cool, guys, we'll be back

2579
03:01:06,950 --> 03:01:13,117
next week Thursday with Chris Hardwick, who will be
joining us as a guest.

2580
03:01:13,117 --> 03:01:14,203
LAURA: Yay!

2581
03:01:14,203 --> 03:01:16,134
MARISHA: How is he going to be here?

2582
03:01:16,134 --> 03:01:19,133
TALIESIN: As himself. He's going to be playing
himself, it's going to be very exciting.

2583
03:01:19,133 --> 03:01:21,527
TRAVIS: Guys, I'm a human. Usually.

2584
03:01:21,527 --> 03:01:24,391
LIAM: I'm super busy, I'm super busy.

2585
03:01:24,391 --> 03:01:27,036
TALIESIN: Out of the rift suddenly comes Chris
Hardwick.

2586
03:01:27,036 --> 03:01:28,998
MARISHA: Super busy, but I'm super successful.

2587
03:01:28,998 --> 03:01:31,107
LIAM: I'll help save the world, but I got like 50
things on my schedule.

2588
03:01:31,107 --> 03:01:40,879
MATT: Yeah, so we'll be back then. I think April
21st is going to be our 50th episode. We're

2589
03:01:40,879 --> 03:01:52,036
going to be doing a fun little evening there.
We'll have Critmas coming up, probably end up

2590
03:01:52,036 --> 03:01:55,876
being that night, maybe another night that week, we'll
have details coming up soon, we're trying to

2591
03:01:55,876 --> 03:01:59,721
figure out the schedule on that. This'll be our
big 50th anniversary Critmas blowout, and then

2592
03:01:59,721 --> 03:02:03,863
we're going to scale it back to like an
annual-type event it looks like, both to save the

2593
03:02:03,863 --> 03:02:10,724
people who work this channel Thursday nights and
stay super later to get here, to save the length

2594
03:02:10,724 --> 03:02:14,722
of the episodes, and to help all of us who have to
then go to work sometimes very early

2595
03:02:14,722 --> 03:02:16,043
the next morning.

2596
03:02:16,043 --> 03:02:20,522
LIAM: We love you, but I need to sleep. It's as
simple as that. We love you, and we love Critmas,

2597
03:02:20,522 --> 03:02:23,180
but it's a health thing.

2598
03:02:23,180 --> 03:02:27,494
MATT: So what we'll be doing is this will be our
big blowout Critmas, we'll still do it probably

2599
03:02:27,494 --> 03:02:32,410
for the holidays, and we really implore you guys
to give to charities, send us stuff, we still read

2600
03:02:32,410 --> 03:02:35,983
them, we'll still do Periscopes, those
of us who get gifts, some of us will open them on

2601
03:02:35,983 --> 03:02:39,580
Periscope for you, so we'll still have the
interaction, we'll have to do it on our own time

2602
03:02:39,580 --> 03:02:42,432
and not at 11, midnight.

2603
03:02:42,432 --> 03:02:43,724
TRAVIS: 12, 12:30.

2604
03:02:43,724 --> 03:02:44,969
LIAM: 12:37.

2605
03:02:44,969 --> 03:02:46,304
TALIESIN: On a 7AM call.

2606
03:02:46,304 --> 03:02:50,577
MATT: So this'll be our big general blowout. So if
you're planning something for the next Critmas,

2607
03:02:50,577 --> 03:02:54,868
this'll be the one to get it in for. But yeah, you
can check out the guide to Critmas on Geek &amp;

2608
03:02:54,868 --> 03:02:58,242
Sundry, it has a list of all our supported
charities if you want to give there. It's highly

2609
03:02:58,242 --> 03:03:03,575
recommended. Thank you guys so much for those who
donated to 826 tonight so we can go ahead and help

2610
03:03:03,575 --> 03:03:05,121
out the Seattle branch.

2611
03:03:05,121 --> 03:03:07,226
MARISHA: 826 Seattle! We love you.

2612
03:03:07,226 --> 03:03:09,291
MATT: And yeah. Do we have anything else?

2613
03:03:09,291 --> 03:03:13,316
ALL: Happy St. Patty's Day.

2614
03:03:13,316 --> 03:03:15,592
LAURA: You guys are hopefully sitting at home
being very good.

2615
03:03:15,592 --> 03:03:18,202
LIAM: For fuck's sake, take an Uber.

2616
03:03:18,202 --> 03:03:24,865
MATT: All right, guys. Well, have a wonderful
night, and is it Thursday yet? Bye!
