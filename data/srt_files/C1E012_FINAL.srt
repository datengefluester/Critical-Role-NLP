1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:01:08,499
[dramatic music]

2
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:16,310
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

3
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:24,121
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

4
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:28,167
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

5
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,933
(record scratch) Wait.

6
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:36,672
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

7
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:39,899
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

8
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,344
Also ale.

9
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:47,779
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

10
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:54,152
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

11
00:01:54,152 --> 00:02:02,371
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

12
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:09,207
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his disobedience

13
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:11,453
cost him dearly.

14
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:19,312
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

15
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:26,591
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

16
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:34,313
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

17
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:39,968
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

18
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:46,925
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

19
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:52,901
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

20
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,506
Also ale!

21
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:59,892
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

22
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:04,830
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

23
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,708
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

24
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:13,609
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

25
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:19,476
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

26
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:25,250
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

27
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,773
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

28
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:36,694
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

29
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:41,297
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

30
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:46,627
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

31
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:53,791
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

32
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:59,520
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

33
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,922
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

34
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:10,889
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

35
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:16,942
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

36
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:22,573
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

37
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:29,412
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

38
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:35,530
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

39
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,322
will ever return.

40
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:42,625
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

41
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:48,944
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

42
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:57,714
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

43
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:04,607
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

44
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:10,480
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

45
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,125
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

46
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:21,520
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

47
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,496
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

48
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,669
would stand in their way.

49
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:35,198
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

50
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:41,049
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

51
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:47,819
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

52
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,214
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

53
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:57,604
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

54
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:04,197
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

55
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:12,131
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

56
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:17,168
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood.

57
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:22,303
Her ancestors were a family of Deep Gnomes
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

58
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:28,592
Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them
with the curse of the last name Trickfoot.

59
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,241
Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption,
had other plans for Pike's great-great grandfather

60
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:40,579
Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after
a dream. A dream that changed the course of the

61
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:46,000
Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to 
Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him

62
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,123
and his family would live a life of service and
devotion.

63
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:57,973
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal, 
whether it was animals, people, or even flowers.

64
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:02,121
She felt she had a purpose in making things whole
that had once been broken.

65
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,085
She studied and learned the ways to heal
through divine magic.

66
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:12,813
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day Wilhand was captured and almost killed

67
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,522
by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the 
goliaths took a stand against the

68
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:22,450
murder of the innocent gnome, and he himself was
beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,

69
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:29,147
abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike
for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian

70
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:36,016
as best she could, bringing him back to life.
When he awoke, she discovered his name

71
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:42,781
was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best
of friends, a rather unlikely pair.

72
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:48,757
Little did she know that in a few years' time
Grog would soon return the favor and

73
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:54,718
bring her back from the clutches of death.
(roar, crunch)

74
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,808
After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She
wanted to be stronger so that it would never

75
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:05,120
happen again. She spent four months at sea, 
training with the men and women aboard a ship

76
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:11,971
called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol
in one hand and her morningstar in the other,

77
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:14,854
this time, Pike is ready.

78
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:22,161
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

79
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,520
eye on you.

80
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:29,179
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

81
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:33,004
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

82
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:38,956
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

83
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:44,748
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.

84
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:50,215
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world, and honed his

85
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:53,594
skills as a bard extraordinaire.

86
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:57,993
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

87
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:03,712
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

88
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:10,028
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

89
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:14,134
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

90
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:21,382
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

91
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:26,827
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow

92
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,535
gnome, Pike.

93
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:34,259
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

94
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:37,027
and makes the females swoon.

95
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:45,577
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

96
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:48,248
located in the heart of Draconia.

97
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:53,900
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

98
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,631
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

99
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:03,778
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

100
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:09,111
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

101
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:13,558
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

102
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:19,762
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time. In the room were stacks of

103
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:24,650
books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas
around the known world. For months, I would

104
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,224
frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts
from legend.

105
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:32,883
After a long period of research, I made a list of
artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these

106
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:37,425
findings to the high council and was told that all
of the information in the chamber I had stumbled

107
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:43,394
upon was either believed to be fiction, or
unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.

108
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,463
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

109
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:51,048
A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to
convince the city council to lend support in me

110
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:55,902
leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and
diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from

111
00:10:55,902 --> 00:11:01,227
town to town and making friends and allies, in and
for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn,

112
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:07,208
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,
but it was exactly what I needed so I could

113
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:12,124
explore the world and find these artifacts, as I
felt the truth was out there.

114
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:17,767
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say
poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most

115
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:23,300
give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to
things sometimes. I've also been known to be

116
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:30,933
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

117
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:35,535
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn!

118
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:42,345
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

119
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:47,739
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door.

120
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:54,186
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by
a chance encounter between elven royalty and human

121
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:59,836
peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early
years, the twins were eventually sent off to their

122
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:05,577
father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their
cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

123
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:11,668
and their time in the capital didn't last. The
siblings stole away one autumn night and set out

124
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,613
on the open road.

125
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:18,703
After a few years of wandering, they eventually
decided to return to their mother, and journeyed

126
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:24,870
back to the lands of their youth. But instead of
finding their childhood home, they returned to a

127
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:31,344
pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home
burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for

128
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:41,318
answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and

129
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:45,164
his sister set out to find their fortune together
in Tal'Dorei.

130
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:52,481
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to
solve life's challenges in his own particular way,

131
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:58,761
often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his
knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough,

132
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:04,002
(knife scraping) the way of blades the elves
schooled him in more than

133
00:13:04,002 --> 00:13:05,517
makes up the difference.

134
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:11,456
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

135
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:18,938
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

136
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:23,938
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

137
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:29,470
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world

138
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,709
were each other.

139
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,080
MATT: Hello, everyone! Sorry for the delay; we had
a few folks that were in transit, but we're all

140
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,749
good. We're all here now, and welcome to a very
special episode of Critical Role. We have a number

141
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:46,765
of members of our party that are on vacation this
week, so as opposed to continuing a climactic

142
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:52,081
endpoint of a long 11-12 week story arc, we're
going to hold off a week and have them return next

143
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:57,567
week to pick up where we left off, just after the
battle with the big bad beholder, K'Varn the Mad.

144
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:01,956
However, this week, what we're going to be doing
is, essentially, a little workshop. A class, if you

145
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:05,582
will, on Dungeons & Dragons and roleplaying games
in general. For those of you out there that have

146
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:08,809
never played before, for those of you who have
played and want to pick up some new skills or

147
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:13,291
ideas, and for many who are out there who have
either had a hard time dungeon mastering or have

148
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,862
been too scared to try being a dungeon master or
game master, depending on your roleplaying game of

149
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:20,970
choice, we're going to try to dispel some of that
and give some tips and tricks along the way.

150
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,806
So, first and foremost, let's go around the table
and say hello to everyone who is here. We have

151
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:29,125
Marisha Ray, who plays Keyleth in our usual
campaign.

152
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,284
MARISHA: Hello!

153
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:32,881
MATT: We have Taliesin, who plays Percy in our
campaign.

154
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,468
TALIESIN: Greetings. Hello.

155
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:36,782
MATT: We have Orion, who plays Tiberius in our
campaign.

156
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:38,359
ORION: Good evening, everyone.

157
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:41,196
MATT: And the birthday boy, Liam O'Brien.

158
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:42,058
LIAM: Oh, hi!

159
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,853
(cheering)

160
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:47,869
MARISHA: May birthdays for the win.

161
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:50,859
MATT: So we have the support team here from
Critical Role to offer suggestions, answer

162
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:54,411
questions, and help these other guys here I'm
going to introduce in a second with their

163
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:59,364
character creation for the end of the evening. I'm
going to completely improvise on the spot a short

164
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:04,667
game for these fellows, and we'll see how that
pans out. For some of them, their first game of

165
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,590
D&D. We shall see how that goes.

166
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,003
So let's go ahead and introduce on this side of
the table. We have Dan Casey.

167
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:11,493
DAN: Hello!

168
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,389
MARISHA: Dan Casey!

169
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:13,392
DAN: How are you doing?

170
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:15,738
MARISHA: Dan Casey, everybody. Dan Casey in the
house!

171
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:16,960
TALIESIN: There we go. Dan Casey.

172
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,161
MARISHA: Yeah, Dan Casey.

173
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:24,229
MATT: Right over yonder.

174
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:26,397
MARISHA: Hollywood Squares.

175
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:27,412
ORION: Oh.

176
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:33,703
DAN: Circle takes the square! What's up, guys?

177
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:35,754
MATT: What's your experience with roleplaying
games?

178
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:41,489
DAN: I am sort of a lapsed D&D player. I played a
lot of 3.5. I played some AD&D back in the day,

179
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,390
when I had no idea what the term THAC0 meant, at
all. I still don't.

180
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,866
MATT: Nobody still, to this day, knows.

181
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,319
DAN: It's an eldritch mystery not meant to be
known by the likes of men.

182
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,958
MATT: Yes, completely agree. Thankfully,
that's gone now.

183
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,404
DAN: Exactly! Yeah. So I've been playing a little
bit recently. I just started a Pathfinder campaign

184
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:59,738
with some friends, so I have a working knowledge,
but I'm a little rusty, I would say.

185
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:04,228
MATT: Okay. No worries. We'll try and get you up
to speed on that. We have in the middle here,

186
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:10,191
dressed so eloquently, our fantastic overlord, Zac
Eubank.

187
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:15,884
ZAC: I am the Snugglelord! There have been none
before me and there will be none after.

188
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:18,108
I am the Snugglelord.

189
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,650
MATT: It has been decreed, here and now.

190
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,127
LIAM: You killed and skinned a unicorn.

191
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:25,594
ZAC: You can stop.

192
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:26,563
ERIKA: Okay.

193
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:28,093
(laughter)

194
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:33,591
MATT: Our third party member of the newcomers
tonight is in transit, as well, and should be here

195
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:38,186
shortly. Should we introduce them or wait until
they get here? What do you think?

196
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:41,810
ZAC: How are you doing, Ify? How's it going, man?
Oh, good.

197
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,261
DAN: Cloak of Invisibility.

198
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:45,570
ORION: It's called "Giant Penis Jokes."

199
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:52,138
MATT: There you go. We'll have Ify here shortly.
Ify, as I know, plays D&D and knows it pretty

200
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:57,561
well, so we're not losing any speed by continuing
without him. To begin now, before we go, we have a

201
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,083
few gifts here that came in.

202
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,473
MARISHA: We have more gifts?

203
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:07,080
MATT: I've got here an inflatable Cthulu beard for
the dungeon master, so when I feel like going full

204
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,269
eldritch horror on you guys, I'll have a nice
visual tool to help-- I'm wondering if

205
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,411
you can eat through it.

206
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:17,548
MARISHA: I kind of think that the idea was so that
you can be Clarota.

207
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:19,649
MATT: Right! I'm totally doing that next game.

208
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,079
MARISHA: I kind of think that's what they were
going for.

209
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,518
MATT: That's true. I should do that now.

210
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,882
TALIESIN: But can you eat through it?

211
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,073
MARISHA: But can you eat?

212
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:27,827
MATT: I can strain food through it, is what it
looks like.

213
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,231
MARISHA: Can we blow it up? Can we try it out?

214
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:34,183
MATT: Go for it. Yeah. There are tiny mouth holes
that are all segmented, so it'd have to be a fine

215
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:38,921
paste or a liquid bakery item I could push
through.

216
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:40,595
DAN: Just pull it forward slightly and pour soup
in.

217
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:42,930
MATT: (laughs) Perfect. This will work out well.

218
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,493
TALIESIN: It will keep the bay leaf out. That's
very useful.

219
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:51,086
MATT: Also, somebody presented this fantastic
glittery dragon dungeon master mug that I'm

220
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:57,444
enjoying my delicious beverage out of. So this is
delightful, and it's getting all over my hands, so

221
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:02,309
don't question it later. It's the mug. I haven't
been out late with strippers.

222
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,133
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Dragon strippers.

223
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,106
MATT: Dragon strippers. Those are the most
expensive.

224
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:09,696
TALIESIN: They work for scale.

225
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:12,157
(groaning)

226
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,550
TALIESIN: There you are.

227
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:19,595
MATT: Also, this awesome crocheted beholder bag.

228
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,809
TALIESIN AND ORION: Oh my god.

229
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,948
MATT: As representation of our fantastic boss
battle with K'Varn last week. I'm going to find

230
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:32,995
many cool things to put inside of this. Or just
wear it when I'm alone at home. And nothing else.

231
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,122
It'll be great.

232
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:34,949
ORION: And nothing else?

233
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:39,416
MATT: Yeah. Just this. (laughs) It's got the right
texture. No. This is awesome. Thank you guys so

234
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:45,842
much. These are amazing. We had a few more gifts
come in as well, but they're party-centric, to the

235
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:49,138
whole group, and I want to wait until we have
everyone here before we distribute those, so for

236
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:52,423
those of you who have sent those gifts, you know
who you are, next week we'll be unveiling those

237
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,607
when everyone is present because I think they
deserve it.

238
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:59,136
Also, there was a letter that because our boss
battle ran long last week, I didn't get a chance

239
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:05,009
to read on air, but I'd like to read it for you
guys right now. From one of our fans.

240
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,731
MARISHA: That's hot, right?

241
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:10,187
MATT: We'll talk later. (clicks tongue)

242
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:16,514
(laughs) "Dear amazing, talented, giving,
friendly, sociable cast of Critical Role: With all

243
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:19,900
"those adjectives in the salutation, it might be
hard to write a letter, but I will do my best.

244
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,889
"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times thank you
for giving us so much of your time each week. I

245
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:27,276
"mention it frequently that your performances call
back to the golden age of radio and the large-cast

246
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:31,213
"performance dramas of the '20s and '40s." Those
were awesome times!

247
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:35,818
"We're all aware how busy you are, with work as
well as family, yet you're able to visit us each

prevent you from entertaining us, you've

249
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,635
"frequently joined us in chat, and Liam has stopped
in a couple of times during other shows, as well.

250
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:47,429
"Your frequent drops in during the week are always
a welcome surprise. The amount of involvement by

251
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:51,001
"you and the community is surprising, considering
how busy you are, although not unexpected when you

252
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:54,115
"make it so abundantly clear that you care about us
and enjoy your interactions with us."

253
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:57,628
Aw. You make me all touched, here.

254
00:19:57,628 --> 00:20:02,765
"There is a more collective statement about the
entire community that is Team Hooman, but I really

255
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:06,498
"lose myself in a sense of awe at this community
and how much we give and how supportive we are."

256
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:11,142
Which is very, very true. You guys are incredible.
"Thank you so very much for being part of it and

257
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:15,644
"contributing to it. You are all proving to be
amazing examples of hoomanity and are inspiring us

"to ever-greater things. I'm writing this letter
the night of your Q&A," which we did a couple

259
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:24,426
weeks ago, "when we crossed the 1000-shirt
threshold and your generosity with your time and

atmosphere. Your reactions when we, in our own

"small ways, contribute to the stream or the
charity or the fandom, are enough to melt the

to do more. Watching you create this world,

263
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:40,271
"pulling out your character voices and hearing the
amazing shit that comes out of Matt's mouth."

264
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:46,126
That's a phrase. It's amazing shit.

265
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:47,224
MARISHA: Ify!

266
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:48,566
IFY: Hey!

267
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:52,502
MATT: There we go! In quotes, "Seriously, what the
hell was that screech tonight?" Yeah, sorry about

268
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:57,086
that. R.I.P. ears, I know. "Show everyone what D&D
can be. Not everyone is a professional voice

"actor, but you don't have to be a voice actor. You
can make yourself more grandiose and gesture more.

270
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:04,025
"Your body language embodies the characters just as
much as your voice does, even if you don't realize

271
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:07,455
"it. I also have to thank you again for being
generous enough to agree to sign the shirt for

272
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,527
"charity. I'm planning on cutting a loop of
highlights to have running for people who might

273
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,941
"not be aware of Critical Role, but there are so
many. Jolene is ecstatic that this will be a part

274
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,972
"of their auction and I can't tell you how
rewarding that single reaction has been for me. I

275
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:22,086
"can't wait to see what they're able to raise for
charity with it." So happy we could help with

276
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:25,324
that. "I would ramble on about you guys for
a while, but it would merely be the disjointed

277
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:29,159
"ramblings of an overtired fan." That's okay,
we're-- most of our talk is disjointed ramblings of

278
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,083
overtired performers. "Keep doing what you're
doing. It is clear that you're all amazing people

279
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:37,427
"and are more than welcome to join the Team Hooman
Facebook group. Ryon, Felicia, Zac and most of the

"Twitch hosts are already there and it's generally
a cool place to hang out and be supporting of

281
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:43,151
"everyone." We'll check it out. We'll jump on
that.

282
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:46,372
ORION: I've joined it already. Team Hooman.

283
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,976
MATT: "Thank you again for being such great
examples of humanity and ambassadors of geekdom.

284
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:52,868
"It is a pleasure to be able to interact with you
on the internets and occasionally via the Straw

285
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:59,224
"Poll." (laughs) Engineering TPKs, well done. "Most
sincerely, Scott Graupner, Useless Rogue." Thank

286
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:00,838
you so much, Scott, that's a wonderful letter.

287
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:02,214
MARISHA: Thanks, Useless Rogue!

288
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:03,558
MATT: It's amazing. Thank you so much.

289
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:04,689
MARISHA: Thanks, Scott.

290
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:07,813
MATT: This is sincerely, like, and I'm gonna take
a moment here just to say, the community that has

291
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:13,350
sprung forth for this entire Twitch stream, let
alone from Critical Role, has been some of the

292
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:19,677
most amazing and most invigorating examples of
humanity I've experienced, not just on the

293
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:23,235
Internet, but in life in general. And, in a world
which is consistently beating down your faith in

294
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:26,631
humanity, this is one of those bastions of light I
think that lifts me up every day I wake up. So,

295
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:31,194
thank you, guys, for being as amazing you are, for
tuning in and for enduring us in a week in which

296
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:34,492
we're not playing games, but talking about them.
So, uh--

297
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:36,165
ZAC: Cool. I'm gonna poop-caboose that.

298
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:37,103
MATT: Do it!

299
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:41,098
ZAC: And be like: Hey, guys, don't forget to
subscribe. We're like seven or eight subscribers

300
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:47,484
away from giving away a signed photo of the
Critical Role cast and a signed Player's Handbook,

301
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:53,054
because that gets us at 3,150. Another 50 after
that and we'll do the giveaway all over again. So

302
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:55,562
get that Sub Train going.

303
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:58,871
IFY: I love that since you found a name for it you
call it out.

304
00:22:58,871 --> 00:22:59,967
ORION: Ify.

305
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:03,390
IFY: How's it going, Orion? Yo, I'm about to
coop-wibba-coop-wib...coop poop. Coop-caboose.

306
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,472
ZAC: Nope. Nope.

307
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:05,360
(laughter)

308
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,485
ZAC: Nope! Nope!

309
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:12,787
MATT: (Bill Cosby voice) Y'see, have the poop in
da caboose and then it's overdone, y'see.

310
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:14,138
LIAM: Too soon, too soon.

311
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:17,771
TALIESIN: Way too soon. That just conjured up some
bad--

312
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:23,033
MATT: I know. I know, I'm sorry. Hey-oh. So,
introduce yourself! Ify, what you got?

313
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:29,555
IFY: Hey hey, I'm Ify Nwadiwe. You guys know me
from Mulligan. Also, do stand-up comedy, acting

314
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:32,707
and, y'know, kissing Zac's hands.

315
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:35,854
ZAC: You don't have-- They didn't see that; they
didn't know, and--

316
00:23:35,854 --> 00:23:37,371
DAN: Nature's moisturizer.

317
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:39,129
MATT: You can recreate it, though. (laughs)

318
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:42,156
IFY: All right, see, I grabbed-- I was like, "Hey,
Zac." Thought it was a regular handshake. (kiss)

319
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:45,239
Surprise! It's a kiss among brothers.

320
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:48,381
LIAM: Well-roleplayed, well-roleplayed.

321
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:50,335
DAN: That's alarming.

322
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:51,825
MATT: That is a gift that will haunt you for the
rest of your days, Zac.

323
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:55,511
ZAC: I didn't realize that by putting on this
costume I was going to be inviting such behavior.

324
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:57,324
ORION: What, the Snugglelord?

325
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:58,852
ZAC: Yeah.

326
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:00,240
ORION: You didn't think that would...

327
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,080
ZAC: I didn't think it through, obviously.

328
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,258
MATT: Obviously.

329
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:05,156
TALIESIN: You get to make a wish if you touch the
horn.

330
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:06,805
LIAM: Brings out your eyes.

331
00:24:06,805 --> 00:24:09,133
MARISHA: I was gonna make a, "He was asking for
it," joke, but I feel like--

332
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:10,053
MATT: Yeah, no.

333
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:12,293
ZAC: Maybe, y'know-- Maybe just-- I mean, you
kinda did.

334
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:14,200
(laughter)

335
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,515
DAN: Just took the long way around.

336
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:16,705
MARISHA: Took the long way around.

337
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:21,661
MATT: It is also the birthday of our fantastic
half-elven ranger, Laura Bailey, who plays Vex in

338
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:25,165
the show. The reason that their characters are
twins is because they actually share a birthday

339
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:29,795
and they created it that way, so that was kind of
a cool little point there. But she's off with her

340
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:33,760
husband in Greece having great vacation times or
whatever. Pfft.

341
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,884
LIAM: Boring.

342
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,924
ORION: Wait. Oh, they went to the country,
Greece.

343
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:38,048
TALIESIN: I thought they went to the show.

344
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:40,608
LIAM: They are seeing Greece. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
North Hollywood.

345
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:48,992
MARISHA: No, I don't think anyone does that
anymore. Like, goes, y'know--

346
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:52,895
ORION: Well, I don't know. They might have
interests I'm not aware of. Just saying.

347
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:57,619
MATT: That's very open-minded of you, Orion. Well
done. All right, cool. So let's get this started.

348
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:58,888
ZAC: Let's learn!

349
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:03,266
MATT: So, we're gonna start here with a little
overview of character creation. So, for most RPGs,

350
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:07,330
especially those in the fantasy realm, this will
be a very familiar aspect where there are many

351
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,258
different game types that run different things,
but usually the point goes you choose a race and

352
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:18,091
you choose a class. The race defines your physical
background, your family bloodline and what

353
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:24,549
attributes that adds to you. A class is
essentially the job or the way you've lived your

354
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:29,480
life going forward and what skills you've acquired
because of it. So, throughout the Player's

355
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,304
Handbook-- you can go ahead and turn through the
first few pages; first couple sections. You'll see

356
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:39,493
there are certain races like the dwarf, whom I
love. Dwarves are awesome. Underrepresented.

357
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:41,780
MARISHA: If everyone can turn to page 62 in the
Player's Handbook.

358
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,386
MATT: Exactly. It's in the Player's Handbook, my
good man

359
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:45,458
ZAC: Technically, page 18. Page 18.

360
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:49,789
MATT: Dwarves are cool. They're sturdy. They're
strong. They're a little brash. They're, y'know--

361
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:53,197
If that's something you guys are thinking about as
you're coming up with your character ideas,

362
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:57,052
dwarves are fun for that reason. I'm gonna breeze
through these 'cause we don't want you to spend 30

363
00:25:57,052 --> 00:26:02,466
minutes on races. We have elves. Elves, you know
elves. Lord of the Rings. Elves are cool. They

364
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:08,371
have high elves which are a little more haughty
and well-learned. We have the forest elves, or

365
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:13,447
whatever it is they're called. Or are they just
the basic-- All right! We have wood elf, there we

366
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:18,031
go. Which are more of the Legolas-style, you know,
in the woods, hunting, being stealthy. And then

367
00:26:18,031 --> 00:26:21,099
you have the dark elves, which are the drow, that
are from actually the Underdark, where you guys

368
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:24,169
have been fighting through, though you have not
encountered any drow in the Underdark.

369
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:24,940
MARISHA: We haven't!

370
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,879
TALIESIN: We had half a drow.

371
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:31,425
MATT: Stitch monster was elven, not drow.

372
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,606
TALIESIN: Oh, I thought it was a drow.

373
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:36,832
LIAM: They're mostly bad. Most are bad.

374
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:43,532
MATT: Yeah. So, there are also halflings, which,
you could say hobbit, but I think the Dungeons &

375
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:48,624
Dragons version of halflings are a little more
awesome, butt-kicking, a little less, "I just want

376
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:51,393
"to stay home and make little farm animals."

377
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:54,727
ZAC: We found what Lucas is. Short.

378
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:56,348
MARISHA: Short?

379
00:26:56,348 --> 00:27:01,580
MATT: We got humans, which are cool and
well-rounded, all across the board. You got

380
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,860
dragonborn, which have dragon bloodlines, like
Tiberius over here. Get like a breath weapon. Get

381
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,554
really strong, charismatic. You have gnomes, which
we have two gnomes in our campaign. They're the

382
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:15,727
smallest of all the races. They're also probably
the most nimble and the most naturally resistant

383
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,362
against magic types, so they can--

384
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:18,914
LIAM: Are they the shortest?

385
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:23,049
MATT: They are the shortest. Yes. Shorter than
dwarves and halflings. You also have half-elves,

386
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,998
which we have quite a few in our campaign.

387
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:26,256
MARISHA: Represent!

388
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:28,683
MATT: Happened through some drunken evening
between a human and an elf.

389
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:29,696
DAN: Sick.

390
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:33,600
MATT: Get a little bit of both sides. Then you
have the half-orc, which is half-human, half-orc.

391
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,186
Generally a much larger, stronger, quicker to
anger, ready for battle type. And then you have

392
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:44,846
the tieflings, who are humanoid but have somewhere
in their previous bloodline some contact with

393
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:50,026
demonic forces that left them with some essence of
the Hells in their bloodlines. Like horns, tails,

394
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:53,750
yellow eyes-- Think Nightcrawler from X-Men,
that's kind of what a tiefling would look like.

395
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,358
Possibly with horns. So those are the races! So if
you have some ideas, keep that in the back of your

396
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:01,087
mind, and write down on your sheet what you think
would be a cool race.

397
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:06,685
ORION: I think a new one is the djinn. Like
there's like a djinn race, like there's an air, a

398
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,389
water, and a fire and earth elemental-- Like a
half human and yeah--

399
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:10,471
DAN: Whoa, like an evil genie?

400
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:11,509
MATT: That's cool.

401
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:14,223
ORION: I think the new expansion, like djinns,
however you say it.

402
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:17,175
MATT: And of course, we also have the goliaths,
which are half-giants. We're not going to be

403
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:20,471
working with that tonight, 'cause those were in
the new Elemental Evil edition. That's what Grog

404
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:25,948
is. They're big, strong guys. So keep in mind the
race you want to play, which is cool. Classes we

405
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:33,384
got! So, we got barbarian. Grog is a great example
of a barbarian. Big, hearty, warrior types that

406
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:40,489
shun armor for just pure aggression and anger.
They use rage as a means of destroying their foes,

407
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:47,066
upping their abilities in combat and preventing
mental effects magically affecting them. We have

408
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:52,925
bards. Bards are vastly skilled across the board.
They have skills of all types, even things they

409
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:56,345
don't know very well; they know a little bit of
everything, kind of a jack of all trades. They

410
00:28:56,345 --> 00:29:00,591
have some minor spellcasting. They also can
inspire other people with songs, speech and help

411
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:07,855
them out with certain skill checks. Bards are
pretty cool. We got clerics. Your healers. But you

412
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:12,107
say healer, you're like, "I don't want to be a
healer." Clerics also have access to really

413
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:16,992
powerful divine magic, so while people may be,
"Oh, Clerics are dumb, you heal the party," they

414
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:19,752
can also call down divine judgment, which is
great.

415
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:27,003
MARISHA: Also, having a healer is really nice.
Yeah. Nice being able to have a healer.

416
00:29:27,003 --> 00:29:29,145
TALIESIN: The hell, dude? Yeah, we should've just
worn the same shirt.

417
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:32,433
MATT: But don't feel like you have to. This is a
one-shot. You guys can pick whatever you want. We

418
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:33,690
got druids, which do--

419
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,732
DAN: (laughs) Yeah. Total party wipe.

420
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,701
MATT: Exact-- Oh, it could happen. I won't feel
guilty about this one.

421
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:39,664
(laughter)

422
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:41,043
ZAC: Thanks, man. C'mon.

423
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:42,762
MATT: Hey. First time in the game! Done.

424
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:43,925
DAN: I take the physical challenge.

425
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:45,037
(laughter)

426
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:49,262
MATT: Physical challenge, physical challenge.
Druids also have some healing capabilities. They

427
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:57,058
also have more nature-based magics. They're cool
and they control nature. And can turn into beasts,

428
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:00,463
and creatures like that. Keyleth is a druid.

429
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:01,497
TALIESIN: Giant scorpions.

430
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:05,012
MATT: Indeed. We have fighters! Fighters are just
straight-up fighters. Imagine what a fighter is.

431
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:09,838
That's a fighter. They can use all armor and all
weapons. They can generally get more attacks than

432
00:30:09,838 --> 00:30:14,072
other classes. They're generally like the marshal,
the generals, the warriors, the pit fighters.

433
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:20,851
They're just more rough and tumble, let's just
damage each other. We've got monks! Monks. Crazy

434
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:25,839
fast. Punch and do awesome damage with their bare
fists. They can avoid things; they can do multiple

435
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,519
hits per round; they can use ki points to inflict
different types of attacks. Monks are basically:

436
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,917
if you wanna be Ip Man in the middle of a D&D
campaign, pick a monk.

437
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,080
ORION: And I believe like the monk and sorcerer
are the only ones that have

438
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,485
like the point system?

439
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:46,675
MATT: Yeah. We have paladins. Bastion of good and
right in the world, paladins stand for law and

440
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:52,690
wonder, and if anyone proves themselves evil they
will be destroyed and smited by the divine

441
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,618
energies of their god. So, they're generally
pretty pious; they fight for good; they fight for

442
00:30:57,618 --> 00:30:59,852
the underdog; they can-- like a fight--

443
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:01,465
MARISHA: Just saw Zac perk up there.

444
00:31:01,465 --> 00:31:02,707
ZAC: Yeah.

445
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:06,924
MATT: They have good fighting abilities. They can
wear and use most armor and weapons, but they also

446
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:10,518
get a little bit of divine cleric-based magic and
they can heal with a touch.

447
00:31:10,518 --> 00:31:11,822
LIAM: Total boy scouts.

448
00:31:11,822 --> 00:31:12,655
MATT: Yeah.

449
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:13,875
MARISHA: Total boy scouts.

450
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:18,517
MATT: We got rangers, which is what Laura's
character, Vex'ahlia, is. They have good either

451
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:22,768
two-weapon or ranged combat. They can pick a
companion animal if they want to, that's how

452
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:28,057
Trinket came about. Y'know, definitely the Legolas
of Lord of the Rings type. Arrow, arrow, arrow,

453
00:31:28,057 --> 00:31:33,254
everything's getting arrows. Arrow'd! And they got
rogues, which is what Liam plays in our game.

454
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:37,904
Rogues are all about stealth, stabbing in the
back, finding weak points of their enemies and

455
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:43,811
doing serious damage with precision strikes by
distracting their enemies and finding where their

456
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:47,602
weak points are. They generally don't have a lot
of hit points or defenses, but if they can get in

457
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:52,696
there sneakily, they'll do some serious damage.
Then we got sorcerer, which Tiberius is, which is

458
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:57,614
a magical caster, arcane-based. Whereas a wizard
is more of like the classic wizard you see with

459
00:31:57,614 --> 00:32:03,891
giant spell books-- learning and, y'know, Harry
Potter-style classes and that kind of learned

460
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:10,062
magical ability-- sorcerers have it innately in
their blood from their bloodlines somehow. And

461
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:13,309
their casting ability is kind of like an
improvised thing they just learned and are good

462
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:18,287
at, so imagine more of a less-learned,
less-controlled wizard that mostly understands

463
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:25,015
some magic naturally. Whereas the wizard is the,
y'know, the well-learned spell book type; more

464
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:30,721
studious; have a larger breadth of spells to pick
from. But the sorcerer's a little more improvised

465
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:35,431
and can use points to instill power with it. Last
but not least, we got a warlock. Warlocks are

466
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:41,728
magical practitioners who draw their magic from
making a pact with some otherworldly entity. It

467
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,758
can be like demons or the Nine Hells and they draw
more hellfire and infernal-type magics. They can

468
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:51,477
make a pact with dark fey, which are basically
like creepy Oberon-style, y'know, fairy elf people

469
00:32:51,477 --> 00:32:56,564
from A Midsummer Night's Dream; or the Great Old
Ones, like Cthulhu. Hi, Cthulhu, give me magic.

470
00:32:56,564 --> 00:33:01,733
What could possibly go wrong? Those are warlocks.
So those are primarily your classes you get to

471
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:05,696
pick. You choose a race and you choose a class.
You guys have some ideas yet of what you might

472
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:06,969
want to play tonight?

473
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:08,009
ZAC: Oh, most definitely. Yeah.

474
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:08,840
IFY: Oh yeah.

475
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,901
DAN: Oh, a hundred percent.

476
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:11,683
MATT: Well, what do you want to play? Let's start
with Dan. Dan, what do you want to play?

477
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:18,451
DAN: I'm going to be a dwarven rogue. Yeah. Rogue
tumbler. Not the block.

478
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:21,303
MATT: All right, fantastic. How about you, Zac?

479
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:30,069
ZAC: I am the Snugglelord. I am a warlock
tiefling. And I derive my powers from all holy

480
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:33,836
overlord of Geek and Sundry. The evil overlord.

481
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:35,434
MATT: Okay. That would fall under Infernal. Okay.

482
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:37,347
MARISHA: This is feeling really meta.

483
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:38,709
ZAC: No.

484
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:45,108
MATT: Yeah, I'm gonna say that that most
definitively falls under the Fiend Pact. Yup. So

485
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:49,221
you're in a fiend pact. And then, what do you got,
Ify?

486
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:55,877
IFY: Ha! I'mma be Ulfgar Fireforge. Fighter.
Dwarf. Two-handed swordsman. Cut your face off.

487
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:57,161
Take your money.

488
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,752
(laughter)

489
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:00,709
IFY: a.k.a. True Neutral.

490
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:01,976
MATT: All right.

491
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:03,116
(laughter)

492
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:04,370
MARISHA: True Neutral! Do it!

493
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,189
MATT: This is gonna be a very fun, short game.

494
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:08,289
(laughter)

495
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:10,835
ZAC: We got this! What are you talking about?

496
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:12,402
DAN: Never made it out of that first tavern.

497
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:14,161
(laughter)

498
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:15,521
MATT: Aw, man, you guys--

499
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,725
ZAC: I set the place on fire.

500
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,072
(laughter)

501
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:22,015
MATT: Wait, we're not there yet! We're not there
yet! Hold it-- Hold it back, hold it back! Cool.

502
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:26,602
So, for each of you guys, let's go ahead and roll
up some stats for you. So what you do to decide

503
00:34:26,602 --> 00:34:31,228
what your attributes are for your characters, that
basically says how strong they are; how hearty

504
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:35,295
their physicality is; how fast they are. And you
have strength, dexterity, constitution,

505
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:40,856
intelligence, wisdom and charisma. Those are the
six stats. So, for you guys, if you want to go

506
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:44,884
ahead and take-- There are different ways of
rolling stats. Some people do a point-buy system

507
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:48,970
where you start with a certain base stat and you
can buy based on points. For this, we're gonna use

508
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,745
my favorite system to do, which is you roll 4d6--

509
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:53,552
IFY: Oh, my favorite, too.

510
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:56,364
MATT: Drop the lowest. Arrange as desired. So I
guess for those of you who haven't seen how the

511
00:34:56,364 --> 00:35:00,511
dice work, there are different dice values in the
game. You have a d4, which is a four-sider dice.

512
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:07,758
So it's the little caltrop. Painful to step on.
You got a d6, your typical six-sided dice; d8,

513
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:11,684
which is a little more pointy, that's an
eight-sider. You got a ten-sider, which comes in

514
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:16,322
two varieties: regular or additional numbers--
this is if you're doing percentage rolls, you know

515
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:21,388
what the percentile dice numbers are. Pardon me. A
d12, which is only really used if you're a

516
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:26,196
barbarian, apparently. It's the saddest and the
red-headed stepchild of D&D.

517
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:27,917
TALIESIN: I use a d12.

518
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,164
MATT: Oh yeah, that's right, you use it, too! It's
great. I'm happy. It needs more love, it needs

519
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:35,191
more love. d12 needs more love. And the d20, which
is the most-used dice in the game. Most all

520
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:40,323
decisions are based on a 20-sided dice. We'll get
into that in a little bit. So, for the statistics,

521
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:48,803
I need you guys to go ahead and take 4d6-- so four
six-sided dice. We'll start-- whoever wants to

522
00:35:48,803 --> 00:35:50,724
start, go ahead and you--

523
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:52,826
MARISHA: I have the four-- those four right up
front.

524
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:54,056
ZAC: Right up front?

525
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:55,125
MARISHA: There you are.

526
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,246
MATT: You roll them, drop the lowest number--

527
00:35:56,246 --> 00:35:57,705
DAN: Yahtzee.

528
00:35:57,705 --> 00:35:59,793
MATT: Starting with a seven! Awesome.

529
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:01,098
DAN: Yeah! Big sev'!

530
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:02,038
MARISHA: Woo!

531
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:04,610
MATT: So, you can decide where you want to put
your seven, in any of those stats.

532
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,313
MARISHA: If your stats are super crappy, we'll
roll again.

533
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:08,492
MATT: No, we won't.

534
00:36:08,492 --> 00:36:14,090
MARISHA: No, we won't. Not tonight. Never mind.
But normally if your stats are super crappy--

535
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,639
DAN: It's not that kind of campaign! No, play it
where it lies.

536
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,244
MATT: You can put it wherever you want to. Ten is
an average score. An average person has a ten.

537
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:23,536
DAN: So C-.

538
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:28,528
MARISHA: What we generally do is roll all six and
then write them down, and then decide where you

539
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:31,852
want them. Okay.

540
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:33,170
MATT: What you got over there?

541
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,291
ZAC: I have 15 on my first one.

542
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,303
IFY: Eight!

543
00:36:35,303 --> 00:36:37,621
MATT: Ooh! Nice. 15 and eight. What you got, Dan?

544
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:40,482
IFY: Oh. Sorry, that counts as a six.

545
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:43,010
DAN: Oh, there we go! Big 13. Big 13 in the
house.

546
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,297
IFY: So that was-- I'm sorry. Correction: 14, was
that.

547
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,430
MATT: All righty.

548
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:53,478
IFY: Apparently, this was from a wild western and
they have a bull's head as a six instead of a--

549
00:36:53,478 --> 00:37:06,043
MATT: There you go. All righty. And we'll say for
the purposes of this we'll give you guys each, if

550
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:09,293
you want to-- Roll five times, not six.

551
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,643
ZAC: Five times, okay.

552
00:37:10,643 --> 00:37:13,740
DAN: (laughing) All right, 12.

553
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:19,628
MATT: Okay, so roll five times, and then everyone,
for the purposes of this game--

554
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,323
DAN: Oh, finally. 17.

555
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,385
MATT: There you go.

556
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:23,599
ZAC: All right, and then we choose where they go.

557
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,490
MATT: So, you rolled five times, you have five
numbers, then take a 16.

558
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,227
DAN: Ooh!

559
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:28,430
MATT: You can put it anywhere you want.

560
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,725
ZAC: Why, thank you, good sir.

561
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:32,626
MATT: I figure for this, that way if anyone just
rolls crappy, then they're not doing too bad.

562
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,804
DAN: Get that seven, for a bit of character.

563
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:39,407
MATT: Dude. Lower stats are some of my favorites.
Like, honestly, having something lower than ten,

564
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:43,292
at least one, is great. That's how Grog got his
intelligence to six, Tiberius's wisdom of four.

565
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:46,441
Like, those are great defining characteristics of
a character, so--

566
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:49,386
MARISHA: Yeah. I generally have a charisma of
eight, but I have that circlet

567
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:50,999
which is boosting me.

568
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:52,803
MATT: Boosts you to average. From below. (laughs)

569
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,306
MARISHA: Which just makes me average. Right.

570
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:57,032
LIAM: Everyone's gonna play this game the way they
want to, but I think if you're playing it for like

571
00:37:57,032 --> 00:38:01,114
the numbers and maxing out your numbers, and the
like, "How can I deal the most damage," when

572
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:06,033
you're picking your skills, it's less fun, Like,
choose the things that draw you to it as a

573
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:11,699
character or personality or-- Be really weak with
powerful magic or be totally musclebound like Grog

574
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,190
with a-- and be a, y'know, an idiot.

575
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,852
ORION: That's why Tiberius is so bumbly sometimes
and really doesn't know shit. It's his first time

576
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:19,842
out in the world--

577
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,402
DAN: Unless you're super into math, which I'm
not.

578
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:22,627
MATT: But go math.

579
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:24,835
DAN: Yeah, if that's your bag, do it.

580
00:38:24,877 --> 00:38:28,318
MATT: Cool. So,
once you have your stats arranged, from that point

581
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:33,009
you can start going to your characters. And we're
gonna go ahead and just make level two characters.

582
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:39,938
Relatively simple. For this first game. If you
look to where your classes are it'll have a hit

583
00:38:39,938 --> 00:38:43,699
point value, as well, and we're gonna roll how
many hit points you have. Everyone starts with, at

584
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:54,474
level one, max hit point value. And I think, let's
see, for the rogue, we have a d8. So you start at

585
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:55,880
eight hit points.

586
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,243
DAN: Oh, boy, I'm gonna roll again?

587
00:38:57,243 --> 00:39:00,107
MATT: And you roll 1d8 to add to that for level
two.

588
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,029
DAN: Two!

589
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:09,025
MATT: Two, all right.

590
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,662
DAN: A hot ten. Double digits. Don't like to
brag.

591
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:11,988
(laughter)

592
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:13,798
MATT: Now, what's your constitution?

593
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:16,004
DAN: Oh, that will-- I haven't assigned them yet.

594
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:16,915
MATT: Okay.

595
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:21,129
DAN: But-- 'Cause I wanted to-- I know as a dwarf,
I get +2 to my constitution. Correct?

596
00:39:21,129 --> 00:39:22,154
MATT: True. Exactly. Yup.

597
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:23,190
DAN: Okay.

598
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,972
MARISHA: Yeah, you get certain racial stat bonuses
depending on what race you choose.

599
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:29,670
MATT: Yeah. Yeah, what we'll do is we'll do a
couple of choosing things and then I'll have you

600
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,847
guys go over and help them with actually building
the minutia of the characters while I go over the

601
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:34,169
Dungeon Master section of this.

602
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:35,058
MARISHA: Okay.

603
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:36,344
LIAM: You had to bring race into it.

604
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:42,684
MATT: I do. I know. Cool, so to just get the hit
point roll out of the way, too, for you, Zac.

605
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,827
ZAC: Cool, so it's a d8?

606
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:50,669
MATT: As a warlock, you are-- (sings) you are
rolling! A d8, as well. So you start with eight

607
00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:53,461
and then add this to it.

608
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:54,454
ZAC: Eight.

609
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:55,385
MATT: Cool. 16.

610
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:57,131
IFY: Nice. Good roll.

611
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:58,042
MATT: And you got a d10.

612
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:00,993
IFY: Ten. Ten, and then imma add five.

613
00:40:00,993 --> 00:40:03,531
MATT: 15 on you. The warlock has the most hit
points.

614
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,147
(laughter)

615
00:40:05,147 --> 00:40:12,416
MATT: We'll see where everyone's constitution lies
in a bit. So, stats? Ten is average, and then

616
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:20,371
every two above a ten creates a modifier. So, like
a 12? That stat, it has a +1 modifier. At 14, it's

617
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:27,512
a +2. At 16, it's a +3. 18, a +4, and so on. And
what that modifier is, is it's the bonus you get

618
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:33,549
to any ability or attempt you make towards
something that falls under that stat's category.

619
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:37,985
Like, if you're trying to break through a door,
you'd roll a d20 and add your strength. Y'know? Or

620
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:42,447
if you're trying to, like a lot of the-- The
reflex saving-- or the dexterity saving throws,

621
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:46,441
it's based off your dexterity, you'd roll a d20
and then add what your modifier would be for your

622
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:52,232
dexterity. So those modifiers based on your stat
are what affect your d20 rolls for most everything

623
00:40:52,232 --> 00:41:02,153
you do in the game. Let's see. So those are the
stats. We'll get to skills here in a moment. Well,

624
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:06,793
you guys will go over the specifics of that with
them. But everyone should be at a proficiency

625
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:11,458
bonus of +2. You should see at the top left of
your sheet, it says proficiency bonus. Above your

626
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:19,803
stats. Put a +2 in there. Now under each class, in
your section, it'll have a section for skills.

627
00:41:19,803 --> 00:41:25,702
It'll say which skills you're proficient in. Under
proficiencies. And it'll have you choose a few.

628
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:28,948
What you do is, in the character sheet you have
these nice little bubbles here that you get to

629
00:41:28,948 --> 00:41:33,245
fill in next to those skills. Those mark which
ones you're proficient in. So you can go ahead and

630
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:41,716
choose those, and fill 'em in. Let's see. I think
for now, if you guys want to go over and help them

631
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:47,357
get their classes a little underway of getting the
minutia of that building process, I'm gonna jump

632
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:49,008
into the next section of this.

633
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:51,352
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, let's do this.

634
00:41:51,352 --> 00:41:53,755
MATT: All right, so you guys, feel free to go over
there and help them.

635
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:56,760
LIAM: Okay. You're gonna chat, while we--?

636
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,757
MATT: Yup.

637
00:41:57,757 --> 00:41:58,688
LIAM: Great.

638
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:01,103
MATT: Keep it a little quiet. We're gonna turn
those mics down over there. We're gonna keep on

639
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:04,278
mine and I'm gonna go ahead and go over more of
the actual Dungeon Mastering--

640
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:06,029
MARISHA: Who wants to pick who for their coach?

641
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:07,445
ZAC: I need all the help in the world.

642
00:42:07,445 --> 00:42:10,819
MARISHA: Do we have like individual coaches?

643
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:15,062
ZAC: Who wants to be really disappointed at the
end of the night?

644
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:16,706
LIAM: Me, me, me!

645
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:17,938
ZAC: Okay, help me!

646
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:19,741
ORION: Which one of you is a caster? What are you,
Ify?

647
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:20,692
IFY: I'm a fighter, so--

648
00:42:20,692 --> 00:42:27,955
MATT: All righty. So! Let's move on to the next
section here. Welcome to the role of a Dungeon

649
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:34,147
Master, or Game Master of this. So, there are a
number of things that you're required to be when

650
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:40,870
it comes to Dungeon Mastering. Largely, your goal
is to be a fair judge. You take all the actions

651
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:47,340
and the activities and the intent and the phrases
that the players do, and you judge whether or not

652
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:53,229
it was a good attempt or a bad attempt, and modify
a difficulty based on it. Basically, for most

653
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:59,371
things that are actively a challenge in the game,
you as the Dungeon Master decide how difficult it

654
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:04,142
is given the circumstance. If it's a really,
really weak door someone's trying to kick through,

655
00:43:04,142 --> 00:43:08,773
like the door's been dilapidated and rotting, you
might say it's pretty easy, so you give it like a

656
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:13,969
score of seven to ten as the difficulty. And then
whoever's trying to break it has to roll equal to

657
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:18,164
or higher than that number. If it's an
iron-reinforced door, that's gonna be a much

658
00:43:18,164 --> 00:43:22,783
higher number. So a lot of what you're doing is
you're judging how difficult a challenge currently

659
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:28,481
is versus what a player is trying to do. The
player rolls and adds their modifiers, you decide

660
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,883
how difficult it is in the back of your head-- you
can tell them if you want to or you can keep it in

661
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:36,372
your head-- and then roll off and see if it
succeeds or not. And then based on if it succeeds

662
00:43:36,372 --> 00:43:42,898
or not, you tell the players what the consequences
are of the circumstance. Really low rolls can make

663
00:43:42,898 --> 00:43:49,152
for some hilarious botches; really awesome rolls
can make for some great heroic moments. So you

664
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:55,860
wanna judge that aspect a lot; it's a lot of what
your job is as a Dungeon Master. You're also to

665
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:02,684
rationalize the world around them. So-- If we can
keep the volume down just a little bit, guys. It's

666
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:09,661
all good, it's all good. It's all good. So,
rationalizing the world around them. Now, what I

667
00:44:09,661 --> 00:44:14,469
say about that is, when they encounter NPCs--
which is a non-player character, anyone that's not

668
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:18,647
controlled by the players-- and they have a
conversation or they do something in front of

669
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:24,607
them, that non-player character's gonna have a
reaction. So you as the Dungeon Master, or Game

670
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:30,813
Master, you decide based on what they've done or
what they've said, the personality of the

671
00:44:30,813 --> 00:44:34,753
character that you're playing, how they would
react to that circumstance. Favorably,

672
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:40,119
unfavorably. And so a lot of your experience as
Dungeon Master is rationalizing that relationship

673
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,809
back and forth. If they're a really charismatic
character that comes, reads the NPC well and kinda

674
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:49,195
sees that maybe-- "They dress well, maybe they
like a lot of money," and so they open the

675
00:44:49,195 --> 00:44:54,355
conversation about money and how they can be paid.
That's gonna be a very favorable reaction, so if

676
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:57,876
they're trying to convince the NPC to do
something, you might consider a relatively low

677
00:44:57,876 --> 00:45:04,009
difficulty. If it's a progressive conversation and
the player keeps bungling their words or rolling

678
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:08,326
poorly throughout the conversation, that
difficulty might get higher and higher by the end

679
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:11,939
of the conversation for them to finally convince
them to do something. So, you're constantly

680
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:17,944
gauging how well they're doing in a social
encounter versus how easy it is for the NPC to

681
00:45:17,944 --> 00:45:24,146
believe what they're saying. Also, you'll find
challenges that are conflicting or versus, where

682
00:45:24,146 --> 00:45:30,356
the player rolls versus an NPC. An example of that
would be someone trying to deceive somebody, to

683
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:34,106
lie to somebody, versus their insight. And so what
you'd do is the player, if they're trying to lie

684
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:39,357
to an NPC, they'd go ahead and roll, add their
deception skill and then me as the Dungeon Master,

685
00:45:39,357 --> 00:45:45,044
or you as the Dungeon Master, would roll a d20,
add that NPC's insight skill-- and if you haven't

686
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:50,564
decided one, you can make one up on the spot based
on how insightful that kinda NPC might be-- and

687
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:55,821
compare the two. If they lose, they'd probably
believe the player. If they win, they don't and

688
00:45:55,863 --> 00:45:59,373
it's your decision whether or not they wanna show
that card or go along with it, secretly knowing

689
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:04,066
that they were lying and then have that bite them
in the ass later on. So you wanna be a fair judge,

690
00:46:04,066 --> 00:46:09,602
and rationalize the world around them and how NPCs
react to what they're doing. One of the biggest

691
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:16,177
aspects of being a Game Master, or Dungeon Master,
in my opinion, is understanding that you're here

692
00:46:16,177 --> 00:46:20,962
to tell a story and you're here to allow the
players to be heroes. The reason you play this

693
00:46:20,962 --> 00:46:26,730
game is you want that heroic journey. And there
are many people that enjoy games that are very

694
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,046
versus, very conflicting, and very, like, Dungeon
Master versus players, trying to kill them,

695
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:34,325
they're trying to survive; and that's totally
fine, too, just make sure up front that you and

696
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:38,391
the players discuss what kind of game you want to
play. Nothing's worse than having a player sign

697
00:46:38,391 --> 00:46:42,839
on-board, make characters, get a few sessions in
and realize that they're now locked into a

698
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:47,863
campaign that is very aggressive and very
fight-and-survive, versus what they wanted was a

699
00:46:47,863 --> 00:46:51,856
very plain, happy, y'know, fantasy experience, so
make sure that you're very open with your players

700
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:56,012
in the get-go what kind of campaign you want to
run. In my opinion, it's the most fulfilling if

701
00:46:56,012 --> 00:47:00,271
it's a collaborative experience, where you provide
challenges, you provide difficulty, you provide

702
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:05,196
high stakes and there is that threat of death, but
you never want the players to feel like you're

703
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:11,943
working against them. You want to be a, kind of,
an impartial judge and be firm but fair, which is

704
00:47:11,943 --> 00:47:15,980
why it's so scary sometimes when they get close to
a TPK, because I set it up a certain way, they

705
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,167
play it a certain way and you let the dice fall as
it does. Or in some cases it works in their favor,

706
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:24,708
like a long-standing boss fight you prepared a lot
that they happened to roll really well on and kill

707
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:31,136
your beholder. Totally fine. (laughs) Good for
them. 'Cause who knows what's coming next? So,

708
00:47:31,136 --> 00:47:36,058
present challenges, present difficulty, but never
really with the intent to make the players feel

709
00:47:36,058 --> 00:47:41,214
like they're unfairly being beaten down and you're
just trying to kill them off in some power-hungry

710
00:47:41,214 --> 00:47:49,727
spree, 'cause it just generally ends negatively
and badly. Also, in that same vein, you want to

711
00:47:49,727 --> 00:47:57,497
reward good thinking, guile, and good in-character
actions and roleplaying, and punish reckless,

712
00:47:57,497 --> 00:48:03,044
against-character behavior. A good example was
Pike, as a cleric, early in the game she was,

713
00:48:03,044 --> 00:48:11,171
y'know, beginning to be a little cruel and,
y'know, while she is a war cleric, and combat and

714
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:17,856
battle is not unfamiliar to her, cruelty was, and
unnecessary cruelty began to fall into a negative

715
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:22,546
point of favor with her deity, Sarenrae, causing
the holy symbol to begin to crack and we're kinda

716
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:27,518
seeing where that's gonna play out down the road.
Conversely, if someone does something really cool

717
00:48:27,518 --> 00:48:32,423
in-character or something that really kind of
changes the dynamic or has everyone else at the

718
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:36,419
table going like, "Whoa," that's really great and
maybe you want to reward them with an inspiration

719
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:40,455
dice, which is-- if you guys have seen the
inspiration mechanics-- you can lend inspiration

720
00:48:40,455 --> 00:48:45,941
dice to players, which allows them to give a bonus
to one of the rolls they make. Our bard, Scanlan,

721
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:49,372
can give those out as an ability, but you as the
DM can also give those out if somebody does

722
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:53,940
something really cool. And if someone does
something really risky, but really crazy dynamic,

723
00:48:53,940 --> 00:49:00,641
even if it seems near-impossible, let them try,
let the players try things that are crazy. They

724
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:04,702
might have a really low chance of working and
they'll fail spectacularly, and those will still

725
00:49:04,702 --> 00:49:09,654
make for great stories and great memories in that
game. So, y'know, let the players be heroes,

726
00:49:09,654 --> 00:49:14,753
present them with challenges, reward them for good
in-character decisions, and try and detract them

727
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:20,435
from making out-of-character decisions that take
and rob the fun from the other players, as well. I

728
00:49:20,435 --> 00:49:23,001
mean, everyone can play as they want to. If you're
running an evil campaign or you have an evil

729
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,850
character in a game that's, like, starting to
undermine the rest of the party, that can be

730
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:31,729
interesting as long as all the players understand
and are down with that type of experience. Once

731
00:49:31,729 --> 00:49:34,653
again, that's the conversation you have at the
beginning about what everyone's trying to get out

732
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:43,219
of the game. Then, another job of the DM, and one
of the other larger jobs, is you build the world.

733
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:48,280
You build the world, you help the players tell the
story and you work together to find where the

734
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,335
story's going from there. I'll get into more
detail with that shortly, but you-- This is your

735
00:49:54,335 --> 00:49:59,497
tale. You can either buy an existing module which
has a pre-built world and you can customize it

736
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:05,398
however you feel; you can play it stringently as
to how the module's built; you can expand upon it;

737
00:50:05,398 --> 00:50:10,582
or you can do what I do with this and just build
everything from scratch and see where it goes.

738
00:50:10,582 --> 00:50:15,428
It's a lot of work and the DM does have a lot more
time they have to put into the game, but it's, in

739
00:50:15,428 --> 00:50:19,260
my opinion, one of the more fulfilling experiences
you can have as a gamer, because you get to watch

740
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:25,674
all these people play in your sandbox and build
their own sand castles and it's kind of exciting

741
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:32,156
to watch them flourish in your own creative space
and play off of you. So I, y'know, while I do

742
00:50:32,156 --> 00:50:36,678
complain on occasion I don't get a chance to play
too often, the experience I have watching other

743
00:50:36,678 --> 00:50:43,264
people, y'know, find these moments, they-- Y'know,
it's-- To me, it's fascinating and very rewarding,

744
00:50:43,264 --> 00:50:50,231
so-- I know it's a lot of front-loading on this,
but (laughs) just trying to explain to you the

745
00:50:50,231 --> 00:50:56,071
gist of this. So as a Dungeon Master, you want to
be a fair judge; you want to rationalize the world

746
00:50:56,071 --> 00:51:00,835
around them; you want to try and make sure the
players have the opportunity to be heroes and have

747
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:07,479
those heroic moments; reward them for doing good,
cool things; try and detract them from ruining

748
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:14,172
other people's fun or doing things that are out of
character; and build a world for them to play in.

749
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:22,457
So, in these books, and in any RPG book, there are
many rules about how to do combat, how to do

750
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:27,295
social interactions, and you can read up on that.
You can take a look at what's in there and,

751
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:32,248
understand, you can play these by the book,
completely as they are inside, and it's a great

752
00:51:32,248 --> 00:51:38,289
rule system, it works really well. But everything
in here, in all these books, are guidelines.

753
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:42,851
Anything can be changed, anything can be altered,
anything can be customized to how you want it to

754
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:48,882
be. If you don't like how movement or actions work
in the game, you can change it however you see

755
00:51:48,882 --> 00:51:52,692
fit-- and just notify the players that's the case,
of course, otherwise they might feel a little,

756
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,892
y'know, taken advantage of if they don't
understand the changes you've made-- but, you can

757
00:51:56,892 --> 00:52:02,280
change and alter anything you want in the game.
It's just guidelines for you to play off of. I

758
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,947
know I've homebrewed a few things and occasionally
aspects of being used to Pathfinder bleed over as

759
00:52:07,947 --> 00:52:14,753
well, but you just take it as it comes. The bottom
line is, as a Dungeon Master or as a Game Master,

760
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:20,242
it's your world and you can-- your word is law.
People can't really argue with you unless it's a

761
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:24,780
rules question that you didn't clarify before, in
which case you kinda have to go in the favor of

762
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:30,266
the player if it's something you didn't clarify,
but for the most part you play the part of the

763
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:36,722
overall god of this world and the players also
have to respect that what you say goes. That's

764
00:52:36,722 --> 00:52:40,270
kinda that weird dynamic between the players and
the DM, it's kinda-- it's a respect mechanic, you

765
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:45,917
don't want the players to lose respect for you
because then they stop-- well, partially enjoying

766
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:49,843
it, but also they start feeling that antagonistic
relationship which can be a little stressful for

767
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:57,285
both points. So, customize the rules as you see
fit. We homebrewed Percy's gunslinger class over

768
00:52:57,285 --> 00:53:04,583
from Pathfinder, because we just-- when we
converted over, there was no equivalent and so we

769
00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:09,243
made something up, and we're trying it out, it's a
work-in-progress, it's by no means perfect but it

770
00:53:09,243 --> 00:53:16,258
seems to be doing okay and it keeps it fun for him
without completely changing the dynamic of the

771
00:53:16,258 --> 00:53:20,241
character he already created. I know they'll
probably release a gunslinger equivalent in the

772
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:22,853
future or something and it might be vastly
different from what he has, but we're gonna stick

773
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:26,814
with this because it's what he's used to and it's
what he's built his character's personality and

774
00:53:26,814 --> 00:53:35,906
combat around. So yeah, just keep that in mind.
The next bit, and this is kind of a big suggestion

775
00:53:35,906 --> 00:53:43,218
point for a lot of you guys. A large part of the
DM's time is spent worldbuilding. I say

776
00:53:43,218 --> 00:53:48,988
worldbuilding, it's creating all the little
details and the aspects of the world you want the

777
00:53:48,988 --> 00:53:55,316
players to play in. There are parts that, like,
creating a society, building towns and villages,

778
00:53:55,316 --> 00:54:00,829
designing dungeons and encounters, all that crazy
stuff all comes together into that world that

779
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:09,028
you're creating. Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh.
Thank you. We have to keep everything down a

780
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:13,977
little bit. But you want to start somewhere and it
seems very daunting as a Dungeon Master,

781
00:54:13,977 --> 00:54:21,815
especially a new one, to say, "How do I-- How do I
create all this-- How do I-- Where do I start?"

782
00:54:21,815 --> 00:54:26,170
And that's a difficult question. Sometimes, for
your first couple games, it doesn't hurt to look

783
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:30,995
at a module, go out and pick up one of the
existing Dungeons & Dragons adventure books that

784
00:54:30,995 --> 00:54:37,247
outlines for you how a city would be built, how
NPCs would be built, and how they would play out

785
00:54:37,247 --> 00:54:41,515
and respond to certain circumstances. It's a good
way to train yourself to see how that process

786
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:46,390
would look when it's finished, so if you decide to
create your own campaign or customize aspects you

787
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:52,438
know where to build off of. If you're building
your own world, I'd recommend starting with a

788
00:54:52,438 --> 00:54:57,637
small society, a small village or a small town.
And you're like, "Okay, I'm gonna build a small

789
00:54:57,637 --> 00:55:02,532
"town. Where's this town gonna be? What's the
topography?" You're like, "Okay, it can be like in

790
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:09,168
"a middle of a forest village," that'd be more
natural-based, kind of farmer society. Or it could

791
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:17,791
be your archetypical urban environment with a very
thriving trade society, a mercantile-run, y'know,

792
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:23,885
people. It could be a port town, it sees a lot of
trade but also has that kind of travel aspect,

793
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:30,387
it's a mixing pot of cultures. Or it could be just
a small farm town that's constantly under siege.

794
00:55:30,387 --> 00:55:35,695
But you want to start with some bastion of
civilization, some place where the players can meet

795
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:42,653
other characters, find adventure, find quests and
find conflict. So you decide, "Okay, where do you

796
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:48,380
"want this small town to be?" As an example, we'll
say this is-- y'know, we'll use the first town

797
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:54,128
they started in the campaign: Stillben. Stillben I
built as a swamp town. It is a port town, but it's

798
00:55:54,128 --> 00:55:59,133
built in this clutch center portion of a large
swamp to the far east of that continent, so you're

799
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:03,207
like, "Okay, it's a swamp town. How big is it?"
You think about it. You're like, "How many people

800
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:12,237
"do you think live there? Let's say, maybe-- maybe
600 people." It's not a huge town. It's not very

801
00:56:12,237 --> 00:56:17,808
happy living conditions 'cause it's very humid
there. The swamp air itself is not very enjoyable

802
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:21,227
to be around, so it doesn't have a huge
population, but those that do live there,

803
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:26,507
consistently, they make a good living 'cause they
can live through this whole horrible-living swamp

804
00:56:26,507 --> 00:56:32,045
experience and can make use of the trade that
comes through. So you're like, "All right, about

805
00:56:32,045 --> 00:56:38,202
"600 people or so." Then you start breaking down
into what factions there might be in that city.

806
00:56:38,202 --> 00:56:45,800
"Is there a thieves' guild or an element of shadow
in the town? Is there a merchant guild? Is there a

807
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,592
"builders' guild? Is there a sailors' guild?" Think
of what type of work would be available in this

808
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:57,672
town and you start building factions based on
that. When you have a faction, then you can start

809
00:56:57,672 --> 00:57:02,120
fleshing out NPCs, or non-player characters, that
fit in that faction. "Is there a thieves' guild?

810
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,735
"How many people in the thieves' guild? Would it
have a leader?" You don't have to worry about

811
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:10,980
fleshing out every single member of the thieves'
guild, but consider like two or three main NPCs

812
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:16,802
that might be part of that thieves' guild. So you
can say, "All right, one of them will be, we'll

813
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:23,563
"say, a female tiefling who's good with
longswords." She's trained into longswords. You're

814
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:27,596
like, "All right, cool." So you can just write up
her name. Come up with a random name-- you can

815
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:32,870
look up online for random NPC name generators--
and write down her name. We'll say, for this,

816
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:43,439
she's taken her "virtue" name of Edge. We'll call
her Edge. So, Edge is a female tiefling leader of

817
00:57:43,439 --> 00:57:49,960
the thieves' guild. Now Edge, what about her,
aside from being good with longswords, is a

818
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:57,993
dynamic aspect of her personality. Well, is she
ornery? Is she very sly and charismatic? Is she

819
00:57:57,993 --> 00:58:02,244
the kinda person that lets everyone else do the
dirty work and just stays in the shadows or does

820
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:06,933
she like to be kind of the face-man of the
thieves' guild? Kinda just decide some sort of a

821
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:11,861
personality aspect to her of those or many other
types. You can go ahead and say, "All right, we'll

822
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:17,378
"say she's charismatic as some tieflings get a
bonus in charisma." So she likes to be kind of the

823
00:58:17,378 --> 00:58:24,303
speaking mouth of the thieves' guild. So you'll
say, "She's charismatic; she's well-spoken; and

824
00:58:24,303 --> 00:58:28,496
"she does well in social environments." A few quick
notes about her personality just to remind you

825
00:58:28,496 --> 00:58:35,093
later on, if she pops up, how she would play out.
"She's charismatic." Then you think, and this is

826
00:58:35,093 --> 00:58:41,121
one thing that I think every NPC you should write
down some aspect of, "What do they want? And what

827
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:46,830
"do they fear?" You can make a shit-ton of really
simple NPCs with just the information of their

828
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:53,627
name, what race and class they are, what they want
and what they fear; and that's all you really need

829
00:58:53,627 --> 00:58:58,168
to branch out any conversation or encounter they
go through. So for Edge, what does Edge want? Edge

830
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:05,235
wants respect and money. As Edge-- respect and
money, 'cause as the head of a thieves' guild

831
00:59:05,235 --> 00:59:08,276
those are the two things that guide her. Yes?

832
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:10,037
ORION: Are you gonna do the backgrounds for them?

833
00:59:10,037 --> 00:59:12,026
MATT: We'll get to that when you finish all the
rest of the stuff.

834
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:13,985
MARISHA: We're doing backgrounds now.

835
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:16,193
MATT: Well, you can do your backgrounds on your
way, then. We'll go through it. It's fine.

836
00:59:16,193 --> 00:59:18,020
MARISHA: Yeah, but do it. Do the background--

837
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:27,618
MATT: It's fine. So! So she wants respect and
money. What does she fear? She fears being exposed

838
00:59:27,618 --> 00:59:34,507
to the masses for her demonic blood, knowing that
this is a suspicious town. You can go that route.

839
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:41,687
Or you could say she fears being discovered by her
long-estranged, demonic father. Or you could say

840
00:59:41,687 --> 00:59:48,789
that she fears-- she fears being alone, and she
surrounds herself by thieves and folk that fear

841
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:54,101
her because it allows herself to feel like she's
in control of an aspect of her life. These are all

842
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:58,218
different possible fears you can go with. I'm
gonna say she fears being found by her demonic

843
00:59:58,218 --> 01:00:04,746
father. And so, those notes there say she's a
female tiefling, she's a rogue with longswords,

844
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:10,656
she seeks money and respect, she fears being
discovered by her demonic father. These are all

845
01:00:10,656 --> 01:00:14,670
you need to now play that character and you just
need to put those notes aside. And if the players

846
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:19,537
ever find their way in that town asking around and
discovering where a thieves' guild might be or if

847
01:00:19,537 --> 01:00:24,882
they're finding where, like, they can find a fence
to sell stolen goods to or to find information

848
01:00:24,882 --> 01:00:30,249
about the seedy underbelly of the nearby town of
Stillben in the swamp, they might find different

849
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:33,688
people willing to give that information depending
on how their social rolls are. If they're

850
01:00:33,688 --> 01:00:38,289
persuading well or, if persuasion doesn't work,
you can intimidate the information out of somebody

851
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:41,833
in which they scare someone enough to eventually
give up a name, and they'll say, "Edge. Edge is

852
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:46,469
"the one you want to talk to." When they ask around
and start finding more information about Edge,

853
01:00:46,469 --> 01:00:51,265
they could decide to infiltrate the thieves' guild
and find her personally. That might be a little

854
01:00:51,265 --> 01:00:54,979
aggressive and you consider, "If a person breaks
into a thieves' guild, the thieves' guild will

855
01:00:54,979 --> 01:00:58,713
"take that as a sign of aggression and will
probably meet them with battle." If they instead

856
01:00:58,713 --> 01:01:02,694
try and find a member of the thieves' guild and
parley with them, they could persuade them to

857
01:01:02,694 --> 01:01:07,575
speak to Edge on their behalf, in which case they
might actually have the opportunity of speaking

858
01:01:07,575 --> 01:01:12,343
with her one-to-one in a not-quite-as-aggressive
circumstance. It can go any which way and that's

859
01:01:12,399 --> 01:01:16,348
kind of the-- The interesting part of being a
Dungeon Master is you never know what the players

860
01:01:16,348 --> 01:01:22,328
are gonna do. You set up these characters, you set
up this world and you kinda let them play, and all

861
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:27,432
you're doing is reacting to everything they do,
rationalizing how the world would react to what

862
01:01:27,432 --> 01:01:32,087
they're doing. So, let's say the players are like,
okay, they asked around, they found somebody who

863
01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:35,060
did some work with the thieves' guild, they
intimidated some information out of them about

864
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:39,450
Edge; you then find somebody you think may be
associated with the thieves' guild and you pay

865
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:44,266
them a lot of money and persuade them to go ahead
and speak to Edge on their behalf, asking that she

866
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:50,679
would meet with you at this inn at this time. Your
party then goes to that inn room and waits for a

867
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:56,552
while. Over a short period of time, it seems like
she's not gonna show up, based on how you think

868
01:01:56,552 --> 01:02:01,037
she would react to that experience. I'd say she's
curious enough that someone sought her out that

869
01:02:01,037 --> 01:02:04,711
she would want to hear what they have to say,
'cause there might be money in it. Let's say the

870
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:08,756
party has gained some renown in the local village,
perhaps she wants to align herself with these

871
01:02:08,756 --> 01:02:15,282
upcoming adventurers, there's always money to be
gained there. So you have her knock on the door.

872
01:02:15,282 --> 01:02:19,870
As the party enters the door, there's nobody
there, but at that same moment they hear the

873
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:23,662
sliding of glass, turn around, notice that she
slipped in through the back window and is now

874
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:27,729
leaning against the back wall with her arms
crossed, waiting expectantly for them to start the

875
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:35,097
conversation since they so openly sought her
existence. So now they're in a conversation with

876
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:39,098
Edge. You can decide how to play their
personality. If you want her to be as charismatic

877
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:43,746
as you said before, she would bow deeply; you
could say that she was happy to introduce herself

878
01:02:43,746 --> 01:02:48,523
and, while hearing some things about the party,
she's eager to understand what it is they might

879
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:55,882
have to do with her. Let the party explain now
what it is that they want from her. Then you

880
01:02:55,882 --> 01:03:00,929
decide: does it fall within the respect and money
she wants? She could tell them, "I'll help you

881
01:03:00,929 --> 01:03:05,334
"with this circumstance, as long as you pay me this
much." Or, conversely, "I'll help you with this,

882
01:03:05,334 --> 01:03:11,808
"as long as you can talk to so-and-so in the town
and get them to drop this bounty on my head."

883
01:03:11,808 --> 01:03:17,229
Y'know? You think of what things would fall into
her wants and needs the party could do for her and

884
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:23,360
in turn could help them. However, if they've
talked around the town, they may notice that she

885
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,982
has demonic lineage, and they might bring it up in
conversation and see her reaction. She might be

886
01:03:27,982 --> 01:03:33,576
very good at hiding that aspect. She might be able
to, y'know, to say, "Well, yes, I'm a tiefling

887
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:39,034
"indeed, but, y'know, that is not of my own doing."
The players could then go, "Huh. She seems

888
01:03:39,034 --> 01:03:43,384
uncomfortable. I'm gonna roll an insight check on
this," then roll an insight check-- they roll a

889
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:49,822
d20, adding their insight skill. The DM then, you,
privately would go ahead and roll a deception

890
01:03:49,822 --> 01:03:53,995
roll, or a persuasion roll depending on what you
thought was the circumstance for that, versus

891
01:03:53,995 --> 01:03:59,285
their roll and let them know what they read off of
her awkwardness. If they roll really low, you'd be

892
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:03,024
like, "She just seems put off by the fact that
you've never seen a tiefling." If they roll really

893
01:04:03,024 --> 01:04:07,907
well, you could tell them that at the notion of
tiefling and demonic blood, she fidgets and looks

894
01:04:07,907 --> 01:04:12,701
over her shoulder, seemingly like she's afraid
something's following her. Then the party can

895
01:04:12,701 --> 01:04:17,894
press her in that regard, and begin to say things
like, "Well, if you aren't gonna help us, we have

896
01:04:17,894 --> 01:04:21,593
"a warlock friend who does dealings with the
infernal and we know your name now. If there's

897
01:04:21,593 --> 01:04:26,165
"someone chasing you, y'know, we could call them on
you unless you help us." Now it becomes-- as

898
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:30,215
opposed to a persuasion, it becomes an
intimidation-based experience; and if they can

899
01:04:30,215 --> 01:04:34,720
manage to convince her to help out of sheer
intimidation and fearing for what she doesn't want

900
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:40,081
to happen, she becomes an ally, although a much
more tenuous relationship. So that's an NPC that I

901
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:44,601
just made up right now and fleshed out. But
really, the basis you need for an NPC, to build

902
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:52,733
off any of those circumstances, is: a name, a race
and class, what they want, what they fear. Those

903
01:04:52,733 --> 01:04:56,789
are some of the biggest things you need to--
everything else can be improvised on the spot.

904
01:04:56,789 --> 01:05:01,594
Like I said, it's all reactionary as a DM, which
is great, because once you set the world, the

905
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:06,020
players drive the story, and you just react off
what they're doing and rationalize how the world

906
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:11,910
would react to it. I understand this is a lot of
information up front, but I'm trying to get as

907
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:17,471
much information into this talk as I can 'cause we
have a limited time and I've had a lot of

908
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:21,083
questions today I'm trying to get through for you
guys. So I hope this has been helpful. We'll get

909
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:26,036
to questions in a second so I can answer things
specifically to you. So that's an NPC you can

910
01:05:26,036 --> 01:05:30,053
create. You can create the same way for like a
local cleric, a barkeep. You could be like, his

911
01:05:30,053 --> 01:05:33,718
race, he could be a dwarven barkeep. He's not even
a fighter; or maybe he once was a fighter, but he

912
01:05:33,718 --> 01:05:39,339
gave up the life, used his winnings in some sort
of a brawling ring when he was younger to buy this

913
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:43,878
tavern, and that's all he really does, but he's
well-connected and has information. What are his

914
01:05:43,878 --> 01:05:50,736
wants? He wants money, but he also wants to
possibly purchase a tavern across the town that is

915
01:05:50,736 --> 01:05:55,692
failing that he thinks could expand his business.
What does he fear? Being closed down, or possibly

916
01:05:55,692 --> 01:05:59,676
getting arrested because of maybe some things he
did in his past that are a little shady that he

917
01:05:59,676 --> 01:06:03,839
hoped nobody would remember. So now, when someone
talks to that innkeep, there are many different

918
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:08,284
ways they could take that conversation, and many
different little ideas you might have as gives as

919
01:06:08,284 --> 01:06:12,657
to what they're seeking and what they're afraid
of. And those are just cool little notes you make

920
01:06:12,657 --> 01:06:16,314
to yourself down the road that if they ever decide
to enter that tavern and talk to that NPC, you

921
01:06:16,314 --> 01:06:20,564
look down and you immediately know where they
stand, what they want, what they don't want and

922
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:26,275
how they can help or hinder the NPC-- or the
players based on what they do. So that's building

923
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:33,137
a very small town and a small NPC. You flesh out a
couple and then you build off from there. And it

924
01:06:33,137 --> 01:06:37,419
takes some time, y'know? You can crank out a few
NPCs; and you can railroad it as much as you want

925
01:06:37,419 --> 01:06:40,590
to. If you don't want to spend a lot of time
building a big sandbox game for all your players,

926
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:45,338
you can play a pretty standard, straightforward
story. You can decide the players are gonna go to

927
01:06:45,338 --> 01:06:50,842
this tavern; the players are gonna go to this,
y'know, this home here; they're gonna go to this

928
01:06:50,842 --> 01:06:58,908
one mercantile-- this kind of textile warehouse
where they're gonna find a hidden underground

929
01:06:58,908 --> 01:07:05,480
passage that leads to an altar to some forgotten
god. In which case you can decide, no matter what

930
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,772
happens, you can send the players-- let them
wander a bit and have fun, but let them know very

931
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:15,189
early in, "You hear that there is some shaky
business going on in this town. People in the

932
01:07:15,189 --> 01:07:18,727
"tavern are whispering about these murders that
have been happening in the village. You're like,

933
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:22,589
'Huh?'" They'll start asking about the murders and
that's when you can point them towards, "Well,

934
01:07:22,589 --> 01:07:27,266
"we've only heard, y'know, that these people have
been being killed when passing around this part of

935
01:07:27,266 --> 01:07:32,844
"town; and they arrested one man last week, but he
was let go from the suspicions and he lives at

936
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:35,626
"this house." Now the players will be like, "Oh,
well we have to go talk to the guy at that house."

937
01:07:35,626 --> 01:07:39,298
You lead them to that house. They go talk to the
guy. The guy might be like, "I don't know what

938
01:07:39,298 --> 01:07:42,830
"you're talking about." You press him for
information, you find out that he used to work for

939
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:48,096
this textile business and he-- Eventually you can
either drive that he helped with these murders or

940
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:52,029
that he knows who is and they work with this
mercantile. Then, now you send them straight to

941
01:07:52,029 --> 01:08:00,645
this warehouse that contains all this, y'know,
cloth and textile woodwork-type materials. They

942
01:08:00,645 --> 01:08:04,172
might break inside, search the place, find
nothing, but if they roll well enough they'll find

943
01:08:04,172 --> 01:08:09,044
the trapdoor that leads down into the altar. So,
that was an example of a very thorough line to a

944
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:14,045
story that you could drive them towards and let
them play within that zone. If you have a lot of

945
01:08:14,045 --> 01:08:19,271
free time, you could build that; you could build
one storyline that deals with one of the local

946
01:08:19,271 --> 01:08:25,224
lords that is in danger of having his home
completely taken by him because of debt; or you

947
01:08:25,224 --> 01:08:31,873
could do another side-story at the same time that
has something to do with a local inn, that their

948
01:08:31,873 --> 01:08:36,003
basement has recently had a sinkhole collapse
underneath the bottom of it that opened up a

949
01:08:36,003 --> 01:08:40,780
cavern of a bunch of strange, mutated, y'know,
rats that are coming out of some terrible-smelling

950
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:45,543
cavern. And all of these can be just aspects that
are in the town at all given points in time the

951
01:08:45,543 --> 01:08:49,860
players may find. And you let them discover that.
It still takes a little more time to prepare that,

952
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:53,943
but that's up to you as a DM as to how much your
free time is and how much you can prepare for.

953
01:08:53,943 --> 01:08:58,300
Y'know, don't be afraid to, if you don't have a
lot of time, to railroad the players a little bit,

954
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,190
as long as you make them feel like they're--
(laughs) they're in control of it; and they are in

955
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:05,022
control of it, too. And I've had a lot of games
where I've prepared a bunch and the players

956
01:09:05,022 --> 01:09:11,354
decided to go this way, and completely get
around everything I prepared and it turns into

957
01:09:11,498 --> 01:09:15,758
this big improvisation experience. And that can be
very uncomfortable for a lot of people that aren't

958
01:09:15,758 --> 01:09:20,652
experienced in a lot of improv, and that's where
preparation comes in and kind of your comfort as a

959
01:09:20,652 --> 01:09:25,907
DM. I recommend, if you're playing and DMing or
GMing a game for the first time, maybe run them

960
01:09:25,907 --> 01:09:31,523
through a story that's a little more linear, a
little more direct, so you just get more

961
01:09:31,523 --> 01:09:37,508
comfortable with the experience, both combat with
the players, more experience with how NPCs

962
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:40,729
interact with them and being prepared for those
circumstances. Then, as you have more experience

963
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:46,566
as a GM or DM, you can begin to be a little more
freeform with your storytelling setup and letting

964
01:09:46,713 --> 01:09:52,244
the players kind of play in that sandbox that is
the world you've created. So those are some

965
01:09:52,306 --> 01:09:57,087
guidelines for like a small village. The factions
are fun to create, because you can have factions

966
01:09:57,087 --> 01:10:02,586
that are allied, factions that are enemies, and that
automatically leads in a really cool idea for some

967
01:10:02,634 --> 01:10:10,122
story hooks where you have maybe a thieves' guild
has a huge rivalry with the mages' academy. One

968
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:15,382
believes that, you know, shadows is a real way to
get business done in the local politics whereas

969
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:21,537
the mages feel that it's more arcane understanding
that both socio-political aspects can be

970
01:10:21,537 --> 01:10:26,211
controlled by the arcane. Maybe you have one
played against the others. The players can choose

971
01:10:26,211 --> 01:10:29,641
a faction to align with and there's a whole quest
line that way. But now they've made enemies with

972
01:10:29,641 --> 01:10:34,257
the opposite faction and now they're having to
steer clear of their side. Or they can try and

973
01:10:34,257 --> 01:10:38,732
double-agent for both but if that ends up going
horribly awry they have now earned the anger of

974
01:10:38,732 --> 01:10:43,801
both sides and might have to flee the town and
never return. So these are all different cool ways

975
01:10:43,801 --> 01:10:49,004
that you can set up faction versus faction or
factions working together to give the players

976
01:10:49,052 --> 01:10:54,476
story and investment in the world that you are
creating. Now, from that small town, you can build

977
01:10:54,476 --> 01:10:59,441
an even larger city. Meaning all those same
elements I discussed you just expand upon. You

978
01:10:59,441 --> 01:11:06,407
build more NPCs. You build an entire district that
is shops and stores, maybe in a giant bazaar. You

979
01:11:06,407 --> 01:11:10,802
can create a whole district that is just about
worship of different gods and deities, and you

980
01:11:10,802 --> 01:11:16,327
have different temples assigned to each god and
you can find, you can use the gods that are in the

981
01:11:16,327 --> 01:11:23,415
book. You can create your own gods that have their
own backgrounds and specialties and guiding

982
01:11:23,415 --> 01:11:28,715
principles and religions around that. It's up to
you. But as you build a larger city, you have to

983
01:11:28,715 --> 01:11:35,394
consider how many different people and cultures
it's now having to house and facilitate. So it's a

984
01:11:35,435 --> 01:11:41,566
little more of a time investment to build a city
that much larger, but it's a really cool

985
01:11:41,566 --> 01:11:44,988
experience to then have the players wander through
that, to continue to discover. Like, the main city

986
01:11:44,988 --> 01:11:48,582
of Emon, which you guys have heard about a little
bit of, but I'm sure we'll come back to soon in

987
01:11:48,582 --> 01:11:54,615
the campaign, you guys will have the opportunity
to see it in person, is a vast city. Much like the

988
01:11:54,615 --> 01:12:01,880
classic Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, it's the
central capital city of this entire region and

989
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:09,147
they've only maybe experienced a fifth of it after
a whole almost entire year of exploring it, so

990
01:12:09,147 --> 01:12:13,950
there are a lot of examples of that urban
expansion that they can go through. And to be

991
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:20,137
perfectly honest I've detailed and fleshed out
maybe about a third of the village with loose

992
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:25,781
notes for all the rest. So if suddenly one of the
players veered right again and decided to go all

993
01:12:25,781 --> 01:12:29,907
the way to the far northern slums, which I have
nothing really specifically planned for, I can

994
01:12:29,907 --> 01:12:34,217
look through my notes and find out a handful of
NPCs and some loose story elements that I made

995
01:12:34,217 --> 01:12:39,717
notes of about those northern slums and I can kind
of improvise based on those notes and where they

996
01:12:39,717 --> 01:12:44,790
want to go in the story to still make it a fleshed
out story, and if it's a really heavy story thread

997
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:49,179
that they're following I can just find a way to
tie it back into the original thread I was trying

998
01:12:49,179 --> 01:12:53,398
to tell, and not necessarily guide them back on the
path, but have it still fold into the same story

999
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:58,308
they've been discovering. You never quite know
where they're gonna take you. Sometimes the

1000
01:12:58,308 --> 01:13:02,286
players take you on a ride and you just kinda have
to go with it. You don't want to deny the players

1001
01:13:02,286 --> 01:13:07,480
too much, because you're all in this for that
storytelling experience, and they want to feel

1002
01:13:07,539 --> 01:13:13,080
like they're guiding their own path. If you force
them too hard against their wishes in the game,

1003
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,016
then it feels more like the DM is playing the game
than the players are, and that becomes a very

1004
01:13:18,016 --> 01:13:26,511
tenuous relationship going forward in a campaign.
The cool note is, the players never know whether

1005
01:13:26,511 --> 01:13:31,125
or not you're bullshitting or you had it all
planned, so even if you go off the rails, as long

1006
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:36,085
as you have some notes or are at least acting like
you know what you're talking about, for the most

1007
01:13:36,085 --> 01:13:41,215
part you'll be fine. I've had whole games that
have gone by, I've run by the seat of my pants

1008
01:13:41,215 --> 01:13:45,637
improvising and I just, I don't know what's going
to happen and it works out in a really crazy way

1009
01:13:45,637 --> 01:13:49,824
and finds a whole new story path and you just
don't tell the players that that happened.

1010
01:13:49,824 --> 01:13:55,557
(laughs) That's a fun little aspect there. So we
talked about urban environments. We've talked

1011
01:13:55,557 --> 01:14:01,446
about cities a bit, you know, which, in those
cities you want to also be mindful of what ruling

1012
01:14:01,446 --> 01:14:09,005
class there is. Is it an oligarchy? Is it a
lordship? Is it a kingdom? Is there an elected

1013
01:14:09,005 --> 01:14:16,100
official? Is it a township? And that political
structure will also be a very, very good way to

1014
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:19,817
build those factions below it as well. So the
larger your city is, the more elements of that

1015
01:14:19,817 --> 01:14:24,167
social structure you have to consider and how many
layers there are beneath it. Is it a very wealthy

1016
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:28,798
city universally? Is there a very, very, you know,
high disparity between the upper class and the

1017
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:34,844
lower class? These are all really cool ways to
flesh it out and give you ideas on where NPCs can

1018
01:14:34,844 --> 01:14:40,418
be and where tension is in that society. Also
remember, just because you're in a city doesn't

1019
01:14:40,418 --> 01:14:44,610
mean there aren't dungeons. Castles and keeps
have dungeons. Some cities are built on the ruins

1020
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:49,658
of older, older cities that may have underground
cavern networks that have been long forgotten or

1021
01:14:49,658 --> 01:14:54,405
tombs that haven't been touched in years since a
strange wave of necromantic energy began to rise

1022
01:14:54,405 --> 01:14:59,739
things from the grave and they just seal it off.
But who knows what lurks beneath there. Or, like

1023
01:14:59,739 --> 01:15:03,393
earlier at that tavern I told you about that had a
strange sinkhole, that's a really cool story arc

1024
01:15:03,393 --> 01:15:07,303
to lead into an underground cavern network to something
that may have caused the sinkhole. Something long

1025
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:12,442
forgotten beneath that inn that now threatens the
inn or possibly the town its entire self. You

1026
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:17,655
know, don't be afraid to have players in a city
environment still find creepy, interesting, weird

1027
01:15:17,655 --> 01:15:25,974
terrain within that city environment. In Emon the
players managed to fall through a cistern into a

1028
01:15:25,974 --> 01:15:31,819
deep, dark underground cavern network that led
them through an ancient ruined city, finding a hag

1029
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:42,331
that managed to make a proposition with them,
whereas for information leading them out she took

1030
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:46,841
a bit of Tiberius' luck-- he still doesn't know
what that means and it still floats above his

1031
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:50,178
head. I think he's forgotten about it, but a
portion of his fortune has been stolen by this

1032
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:56,251
hag, it still resides in that realm. So, urban
environments can be urban but don't be afraid to

1033
01:15:56,251 --> 01:16:00,696
explore avenues above and below. How you doing?
How we doing?

1034
01:16:00,696 --> 01:16:02,655
MARISHA: Pretty good.

1035
01:16:02,655 --> 01:16:10,619
MATT: Cool bit. I'm gonna finish up here real fast
with some other ideas. So those are cities. Those

1036
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:17,713
are towns. What makes them so special is, in the 
D&D world, and in a lot of RPG worlds, outside of

1037
01:16:17,767 --> 01:16:23,894
those bastions of civilization is a very dangerous
world. And you can change that up however you see

1038
01:16:23,894 --> 01:16:29,802
fit, but I find that it definitely makes for a
better environment if the players understand that

1039
01:16:29,802 --> 01:16:35,047
in the wild you find things that are wild. There
are creatures that roam free. There are monsters

1040
01:16:35,047 --> 01:16:41,157
and beasts that call these places home and need to
eat and survive. There are intelligent entities

1041
01:16:41,157 --> 01:16:47,337
that are building their own civilizations in the
darkest depths of the mountains or in the shadowed

1042
01:16:47,337 --> 01:16:54,868
patches of the local forests and going outside of
a town, most traveling caravans need to have

1043
01:16:54,868 --> 01:17:00,063
muscled support hired to come along the way. If
you travel alone there is always the possibility

1044
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:05,569
of bandits ransacking you on the road or some
sort of large hulking beast comes tumbling out of

1045
01:17:05,627 --> 01:17:09,414
a nearby cavern structure and attacking the, you
know, the people. There's so many different ways

1046
01:17:09,567 --> 01:17:14,577
that you can incorporate a dangerous, wild world
around these bastions of society, these little

1047
01:17:14,577 --> 01:17:20,804
points of light, that makes the game feel more
dangerous. It heightens the stakes for the players

1048
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:24,588
whenever they have to travel, and it makes
returning to a town that much more of a breath of

1049
01:17:24,588 --> 01:17:39,480
fresh air. Then, consider villains. Villains are
NPCs that inherently have very selfish goals that

1050
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:45,277
are detrimental to society at large and/or the
players. K'Varn being the Big Bad of the recent

1051
01:17:45,277 --> 01:17:49,811
arc. He is definitively one of the main villains
if not the main villain of this arc. You can

1052
01:17:49,811 --> 01:17:53,345
create villains that are kind of one-offs like
this. They eventually found K'Varn and they killed

1053
01:17:53,345 --> 01:17:56,560
him. You can create villains that are
long-standing and recurring. Like earlier in the

1054
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,724
campaign, the Dread Emperor was always present,
but they didn't even manage to find him until the

1055
01:18:00,724 --> 01:18:05,850
very end. That was a recurring theme throughout,
kind of built that tension about that villain. And

1056
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:09,788
not all villains get killed. Some villains, when
they're damaged, they get the heck out of Dodge

1057
01:18:09,788 --> 01:18:14,643
and return later even more prepared and more
ready, you know. But sometimes the players can be

1058
01:18:14,643 --> 01:18:18,688
clever and keep them in there-- and don't deny the
players if they're really smart and prevent your

1059
01:18:18,688 --> 01:18:23,315
villain from escaping when he tries to. 'Cause you
don't want-- you want to reward the players for

1060
01:18:23,315 --> 01:18:28,009
being really smart. Remember, good villains are
also very smart and usually have a pretty strong

1061
01:18:28,009 --> 01:18:34,470
exit strategy if everything goes to shit. So
villains are a really cool thing to flesh out

1062
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:39,600
their persona and their personality. You look at a
lot of great literary archetypes that can expand

1063
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,562
on that for you. You consider like, you know, the
Chaotic Evil-type villain, which is the Joker from

1064
01:18:44,562 --> 01:18:51,613
Batman. Someone who just like loves the idea of
violence and destruction and ruining the world

1065
01:18:51,613 --> 01:18:55,977
around them for their own personal enjoyment and
personal gain. You have the Lawful Evil villain--

1066
01:18:55,977 --> 01:18:59,413
more of the Darth Vader types-- that work in a
structure of law but use it to their advantage.

1067
01:18:59,413 --> 01:19:07,569
They twist people's ideals of honor and society
and relationships to put them in a position of

1068
01:19:07,569 --> 01:19:13,322
power in which no one can really contradict, what
they say goes. And through that, they maintain

1069
01:19:13,322 --> 01:19:20,334
power and they maintain control over people around
them. Then you have just general evil. You have

1070
01:19:20,334 --> 01:19:24,729
all sorts of different types of evil archetypes
you can play with in there, but have fun fleshing

1071
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:33,198
out a villain and having them be as sadistic or as
controlling or as charismatic and enjoyable for

1072
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,282
the players to encounter, as much as they hate them, you know,
you can have a vast variety from there. But

1073
01:19:37,342 --> 01:19:42,573
recurring villains are a fun theme and generally
up the experience more than just having a Big Bad

1074
01:19:42,573 --> 01:19:45,900
every session that they go in and kill, get the
loot and leave, you know, it's fun to have that

1075
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:52,323
recurring element. I'm gonna cruise through a
couple of points here for you guys, so we can

1076
01:19:52,323 --> 01:19:58,285
start getting to these guys to playing here. Or
any questions they have for the story. Story

1077
01:19:58,285 --> 01:20:04,929
hooks. Story hooks are essentially what gets the
players to start seeking the story, and there's a

1078
01:20:04,929 --> 01:20:10,060
lot of great examples in the Dungeon Master's
Guide here, if you guys pick up a copy, that

1079
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:16,580
explains a lot of different ideals of how you can
get the players invested in your story. Let's see

1080
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:19,686
if I can find it real fast back here, but
essentially a story hook could be when they enter

1081
01:20:19,686 --> 01:20:24,516
a tavern they notice that someone in the corner is
hunched over and eventually falls forward off

1082
01:20:24,516 --> 01:20:27,357
their stool. The party goes and inspects and finds
out that they've been stabbed and are bleeding

1083
01:20:27,357 --> 01:20:33,026
out, and in their dying words they reach up to the
player. They whisper a name, like, oh shit, what

1084
01:20:33,026 --> 01:20:36,354
is that name? What does that mean? And someone in
the room is like, that name, that's the name of

1085
01:20:36,354 --> 01:20:43,946
the leader of this one temple of Pelor, the God of
the Sun, the God of Light. Okay, well, the players

1086
01:20:43,946 --> 01:20:47,056
now have the idea that someone got murdered and
their last words were the name of this person.

1087
01:20:47,056 --> 01:20:50,390
Let's go find out what their relationship was.
That's a story hook. Someone got murdered

1088
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:54,659
mysteriously and you only have a name to go off
of. That's an example of a cool story hook that

1089
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:59,580
the players might be interested in pursuing. Some
players might be, "Ah, fucker died. Whatever." and

1090
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,122
that story hook goes away. But that's up to the
players and that's going to put them in the

1091
01:21:02,122 --> 01:21:06,310
territory of being a little more neutral to evil
than good players. So if they make good characters

1092
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:11,478
and they do stuff like that, repeatedly, they
might start pushing into the evil territory and

1093
01:21:11,623 --> 01:21:16,005
maybe drawing the ire of other NPCs nearby that
are good. The captain of the guard rushes in and

1094
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:19,978
inspects, "What happened to this man?" and you're
like "I don't know, he died." He's like, "Grrr, I

1095
01:21:19,978 --> 01:21:22,889
"don't like the look of these people who don't care
about the lives of others." Maybe going forward,

1096
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:26,871
whenever they encounter the captain of the guard,
he immediately mistrusts the party, and they've

1097
01:21:26,871 --> 01:21:32,023
already established that relationship negatively.
So let's see, what's some other good examples of

1098
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:39,903
story hooks they have here in the book? (sings) 71
and 72. We'll see if they've got that up. All

1099
01:21:39,903 --> 01:21:44,412
right, bear with me as I pan through. And like,
there's a lot of great breakdowns for villains and

1100
01:21:44,412 --> 01:21:47,629
NPCs and stuff in the Players' Handbook, guys, so
if you're planning to Dungeon Master a game I

1101
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:56,477
highly recommend you read through. It's a really,
really great resource. Ah, all right, 71. All

1102
01:21:56,477 --> 01:22:02,761
righty. So there are a bunch of cool dungeon goals
and wilderness goals, like "foil a villain's evil

1103
01:22:02,806 --> 01:22:07,418
"scheme", "destroy a magical threat inside a
dungeon", "acquire a treasure", "rescue a captive"

1104
01:22:07,418 --> 01:22:11,225
-- these are cool dungeon goals. They have it
broken down into wilderness goals as well, like

1105
01:22:11,225 --> 01:22:16,040
"establish trade with a distant town", "map a new
land", "find a natural resource", "escape the

1106
01:22:16,085 --> 01:22:21,314
"reign of a tyrant". And you have other cool ideas
for goals. "Defending a location from attackers",

1107
01:22:21,314 --> 01:22:25,735
"retrieving an object from a caravan", "infiltrate
a fortified location", "successfully travel

1108
01:22:25,735 --> 01:22:29,776
"through an obstacle course to gain recognition or
reward". These are all very loose, very simple

1109
01:22:29,776 --> 01:22:35,368
story hooks and goals that you can then weave a
story around based on how you've built your town

1110
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:40,467
and you've built your NPCs. So don't be afraid to
go ahead and grab a copy of these, this can kinda

1111
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:44,104
be used as an example if you're feeling a little
lost through their story. You can actually just

1112
01:22:44,104 --> 01:22:47,628
roll randomly on these players and be like, "All
right, what are they doing today? Oh well, ah,

1113
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:51,091
"looks like they're infiltrating a fortified
location. Let me come up with some bullshit that,

1114
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:56,377
"you know, justifies what they're doing." So you
can, technically, DM a game randomly by just

1115
01:22:56,377 --> 01:23:00,660
rolling off these and improvising from that point
forward. That's a little more of an advanced

1116
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:04,580
Dungeon Master technique if you really feel like
just winging it from there. But that's a really

1117
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:10,240
cool resource to have at your disposal. Another
question, another thing I wanted to bring up with

1118
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:15,195
you guys was encounters. So when you do get into
battle or when players encounter creatures or

1119
01:23:15,195 --> 01:23:20,833
monsters or villain characters and they want to
fight, you then go into an encounter, and you want to

1120
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:26,532
consider when you prepare for encounters, you
think, where are they? Are they fighting in a dungeon

1121
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:29,728
or are they fighting in forest or are they
fighting in a swamp? Are they fighting in an open

1122
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:34,777
plain? And you go through a book like the Dungeon
Master's, or sorry the Monster Manual, and find

1123
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:39,059
creatures that you think would live in that type
of topography. So if they're in an open field, you

1124
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:47,551
can think of more wild beasts or, you know, clans
of roaming orcs. If they're in deep, deep

1125
01:23:47,595 --> 01:23:51,310
mountains you can find creatures that burrow and
naturally live in more earthy-based terrain, and

1126
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:56,834
you build encounters around that. There are some
really great websites online that have encounter

1127
01:23:56,834 --> 01:24:01,126
calculators where you can basically tell how
difficult an encounter is based on how many

1128
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:06,647
players are in the party, what level they are, and
you can build the encounter based on that. That

1129
01:24:06,647 --> 01:24:10,324
way you don't end up accidentally making something
that's too difficult or too easy for the party.

1130
01:24:10,371 --> 01:24:13,612
And you don't want to make everything too hard.
Some battles can be fun and easy and really kind

1131
01:24:13,612 --> 01:24:18,630
of have the players enjoy being badass and rushing
into combat and just killing things really easily

1132
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:23,022
and being, 'Ha-ha! I ruined everything! That's
great! I am powerful!" And you can have some

1133
01:24:23,022 --> 01:24:26,928
battles that are pretty, "Phew, that was close.
That was a good fight." And then occasionally you

1134
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:29,861
want to throw them a curveball and have something
they really have to struggle through, so when they

1135
01:24:29,861 --> 01:24:34,683
finish that battle they really have to take a rest
and realize, "We almost lost one or more people in

1136
01:24:34,683 --> 01:24:38,527
"that fight," and that makes the stakes that much
higher at that point, but you don't want to

1137
01:24:38,527 --> 01:24:42,269
constantly be hitting them with super-hard
battles. You don't want to be making things

1138
01:24:42,269 --> 01:24:47,444
consistently too easy because it isn't a fun
challenge for them. And consider terrain for

1139
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:52,102
combat, too. Not every battle is just you versus
monsters. Sometimes there's a big cliff involved

1140
01:24:52,102 --> 01:24:56,619
and the battle could be at a distance. Sometimes
there's pits of lava in the middle and that

1141
01:24:56,619 --> 01:25:01,070
becomes a danger or a tool depending on how you
look at it during the battle. Sometimes,

1142
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:04,526
especially in urban combat, you have rooftops and
alleyways in which you can use that to your

1143
01:25:04,526 --> 01:25:09,698
advantage to avoid things, or push guys off a roof
to fall and get hurt. Or fall onto things, you

1144
01:25:09,698 --> 01:25:13,710
know. There can be traps involved that you know
are there that you can then push guys into.

1145
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:17,884
There's a really cool way of building encounters
that are beyond just hitting things and doing

1146
01:25:17,884 --> 01:25:23,609
damage. Which is fine, too, don't get me wrong.
Also, if there's a monster in the Monster Manual

1147
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:27,771
that you like-- like, this is a really cool
monster, but it's too easy, like the players are

1148
01:25:27,771 --> 01:25:32,242
all level ten and this is a level three monster,
you can customize the monster. You can make the monster

1149
01:25:32,242 --> 01:25:36,321
more powerful. Add more hit points. Raise the
stats a little more. Give it a couple of unique

1150
01:25:36,422 --> 01:25:41,413
attacks that you think would be fitting for it. If
you don't like the fact that the bulette only has

1151
01:25:41,413 --> 01:25:47,137
like a bite and stomp attack, maybe you decide
that this bulette actually grew up or was raised

1152
01:25:47,137 --> 01:25:52,426
around some sort of arcane, natural arcane relic
that infused it with a resistance to magic and a

1153
01:25:52,426 --> 01:25:56,012
capability that it has like electrical charges
around it, and now when everyone, whenever anyone

1154
01:25:56,012 --> 01:26:00,956
starts their turn next to it, they get shocked.
It's an electric bulette! That's kinda cool. Why

1155
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:05,800
not? You can customize and alter any aspect of any
creature in the book. Once again, all guidelines.

1156
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,136
You can go with the basis here, and it's a lot
easier if you don't have a lot of time, but don't

1157
01:26:09,136 --> 01:26:13,236
be afraid to customize and alter things to fit
certain aspects of your world or your story as you

1158
01:26:13,236 --> 01:26:18,953
see fit. It's great. I had the players in this
campaign fight a proto-lich when they were level

1159
01:26:18,953 --> 01:26:23,608
three or four. Liches will wipe the floor with
pretty much anything, but I considered it would be

1160
01:26:23,608 --> 01:26:28,866
cool to introduce that powerful undead aspect if
it was like just barely cresting out of its

1161
01:26:28,866 --> 01:26:32,809
initial ritual to become a lich, in which case it
was in a very weakened state. So if they had

1162
01:26:32,809 --> 01:26:36,671
waited a day or two, that lich would have ruined
them. It was still a tough battle, but they caught

1163
01:26:36,671 --> 01:26:41,016
it when it was still essentially birthing, which
made it a very, very weak lich. That's not in the

1164
01:26:41,016 --> 01:26:45,291
books. I just took what was there and scaled it
way back. That made for a really fun encounter.

1165
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:50,071
So, all guidelines. You can customize as you see
fit, and there are great communities online of

1166
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:53,621
people that create creatures or beasts and have
suggestions or feedback for anything you create.

1167
01:26:53,621 --> 01:26:57,896
Don't be afraid to reach out there. Once again, I
apologize, because this is a lot of information up

1168
01:26:57,896 --> 01:27:04,527
front for trying to squeeze this in for you. Also,
maps! You see in Critical Role we do combat with

1169
01:27:04,527 --> 01:27:09,240
maps that we draw up of terrain and we have
everyone has individual models and the creatures

1170
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:14,329
have models. That is not necessary. I have found
it's very helpful for our campaign because we have

1171
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:19,488
eight players, which makes it very difficult for
everyone to keep in mind spatial awareness during

1172
01:27:19,488 --> 01:27:25,075
the battle, who is who and what they're doing and
how close monsters are. I grew up playing Dungeons

1173
01:27:25,075 --> 01:27:30,371
and Dragons and other RPGs without maps or models
at all. It was all theater of the mind, all in the

1174
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:34,226
brain, which is a lot of fun, but when you get a
certain critical mass of players it becomes

1175
01:27:34,226 --> 01:27:38,868
unwieldy, so the the models became necessary for
us, but what we're doing tonight when we play our

1176
01:27:38,868 --> 01:27:43,872
game, there's going to be no battlefield, no
models. It's all going to be just keeping it in

1177
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:47,925
your head and me letting you know what's happening
and where you guys are, so don't feel like it's

1178
01:27:47,925 --> 01:27:52,572
absolutely necessary to do that. I just find it
makes it easier when you have more players. And

1179
01:27:52,572 --> 01:27:57,648
it's fun to draw maps. Sometimes it's a lot of fun
to do that. Another question that has come up a

1180
01:27:57,648 --> 01:28:05,034
lot. Experience points. So, monsters that are
killed or defeated in battle give you experience

1181
01:28:05,034 --> 01:28:08,409
points. They don't necessarily have to be killed
to get that experience points. If the players still

1182
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:13,706
win the encounter, meaning they forced them to
surrender, or they managed to fight them to the

1183
01:28:13,757 --> 01:28:18,692
point where they have to retreat. That is still a
victory and the players should still get the

1184
01:28:18,692 --> 01:28:22,894
experience for that encounter. You may give them a
bonus if it's a big boss fight and they killed it

1185
01:28:22,894 --> 01:28:27,627
and then get to reap the rewards of it. That's
cool. That's totally up to you as a DM, but, you

1186
01:28:27,627 --> 01:28:31,287
know, if they still successfully complete an
encounter they still get the experience. If they

1187
01:28:31,287 --> 01:28:35,173
flee from an encounter and the players technically
lost the battle, you can still give them a little

1188
01:28:35,173 --> 01:28:39,064
bit of experience to gain from that, but it would be
largely docked by that, and that's totally up to

1189
01:28:39,205 --> 01:28:44,777
you. That's combat experience. What about
role-playing experience? That's arbitrary based on

1190
01:28:44,777 --> 01:28:47,883
what you want to do as a DM. You can just write
down, well that's cool, they get five hundred

1191
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:52,033
experience for that social encounter. You can make
it up on the spot, and I recommend keeping an eye

1192
01:28:52,033 --> 01:28:56,246
on what level the players are and what the
experience values are for each level, so you know

1193
01:28:56,246 --> 01:29:01,731
how much they need to get to the next level. That
allows you to kind of build a structure. Now for

1194
01:29:01,731 --> 01:29:07,215
me, to keep track of roleplaying experience, it's
an endeavor with eight players, so what I do is I

1195
01:29:07,215 --> 01:29:13,691
have what I call a hatch marks system, where
whenever anybody does something in the game that's

1196
01:29:13,691 --> 01:29:19,013
a cool roleplaying experience or they save a
circumstance I will give them a hatch mark next to

1197
01:29:19,013 --> 01:29:23,315
their name. Or multiple hatch marks if it was
really, really clutch and really kind of changed

1198
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:27,885
the dynamic of the circumstance and saved their
bacon. Or if they failed miserably at something

1199
01:29:27,885 --> 01:29:30,639
but they gave it a really, really good try and it
was a cool idea, I might still give them a hatch

1200
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:37,495
mark or two, 'cause it was a good shot. And so at
the end of each game I have a kind of an equation

1201
01:29:37,495 --> 01:29:43,205
for myself where I multiply their level by 25, so
right now they're all level ten, it would be 250

1202
01:29:43,205 --> 01:29:49,427
experience and that's-- I give them that many, I
multiply it by the number of hatch marks they get.

1203
01:29:49,613 --> 01:29:53,810
So if somebody gets three hatch marks in a game,
right now, they would get an additional 750

1204
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:59,559
experience points at the end of that session based
on the roleplaying experience. So that way I don't

1205
01:29:59,559 --> 01:30:03,073
have to think too much about the math in the game,
I just go, "That's cool." Hatch mark. "That was

1206
01:30:03,073 --> 01:30:06,998
"really cool!" Hatch mark hatch mark hatch mark.
And then at the end of each session I'll go ahead

1207
01:30:07,045 --> 01:30:11,715
and multiply the level by 25 and then multiply
that by how many hatch marks I've given them and

1208
01:30:11,715 --> 01:30:16,743
that's their total roleplaying experience. That's
worked well for me. It's not for everyone, but I

1209
01:30:16,743 --> 01:30:20,697
think it's a good way to quickly add up those
moments and make sure players don't feel like

1210
01:30:20,697 --> 01:30:29,752
you're slowing it down to keep track of who's done
cool shit. That's a really condensed overview of

1211
01:30:29,752 --> 01:30:31,785
Dungeon Mastering. Um.

1212
01:30:31,785 --> 01:30:33,479
(laughter)

1213
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:34,379
MARISHA: An hour later. (laughs)

1214
01:30:34,379 --> 01:30:38,838
MATT: They've asked me a lot of questions via
Twitter and that's kind of what I've built this up

1215
01:30:38,882 --> 01:30:43,592
for, so I apologize for you guys. Thank you for
being patient. We're going to take a couple of

1216
01:30:43,592 --> 01:30:47,788
questions from the chat room, and then we're going
to go ahead and start the game here in about 15,

1217
01:30:47,788 --> 01:30:56,123
20 minutes or so. So, as I said, I hope that's a
lot of information for you guys, but Dungeon

1218
01:30:56,123 --> 01:31:01,928
Mastering, it's a lot of fun. It takes some time.
You have to kind of set aside some time. I say

1219
01:31:01,928 --> 01:31:07,326
generally it takes about an hour of gameplay per
hour of preparation, so if it's going to be a

1220
01:31:07,326 --> 01:31:11,963
six-hour session it might take anywhere from three
to six hours to set up for that properly, but it

1221
01:31:11,963 --> 01:31:18,331
doesn't have to be that long, that's just me being
super thorough, which I'm obsessive about. But

1222
01:31:18,331 --> 01:31:23,650
yeah, be open to improvise, be open to let the
players play and let them guide you sometimes in

1223
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:29,630
an off-direction, and have fun. Let the players be
heroes. Let them try anything, just know that if

1224
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:33,719
what they're trying is really ridiculous, they
have a really, really low chance of succeeding,

1225
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:37,876
and most of the time they'll fail and it's a
spectacular failure and you'll all laugh about it.

1226
01:31:37,876 --> 01:31:42,657
If they succeed that roll, that is an epic fucking
moment that you're all gonna remember, because

1227
01:31:42,657 --> 01:31:48,615
that player pulled off that third-act amazing
maneuver that completely changed the dynamic of

1228
01:31:48,615 --> 01:31:52,744
the story and that's really what this game is all
about. I still remember and tell stories from our

1229
01:31:52,744 --> 01:31:58,116
campaign like it was something we all personally
did and experienced. It's really weird. It's

1230
01:31:58,116 --> 01:32:03,917
weird! I love it! But it's weird. So, I love it.
Playing the game is great. Learning the rules is

1231
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:08,145
great. Dungeon Mastering is a lot of fun. It's
scary at first, but I guarantee with a little bit

1232
01:32:08,145 --> 01:32:15,881
of time, it's really rewarding and it's really,
really not that hard at all. So yes. Let's answer

1233
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:19,499
a few questions in the chat room, guys, let's see
if you can chime in on this. We'll take about ten

1234
01:32:19,499 --> 01:32:21,963
minutes of this and and then we'll jump into the
game with you folks. And once again thank you

1235
01:32:21,963 --> 01:32:24,109
for-- Thank you for your patience.

1236
01:32:24,109 --> 01:32:28,312
MARISHA: I'm pretty stoked for the characters

1237
01:32:28,312 --> 01:32:30,313
MATT: I am excited.

1238
01:32:30,313 --> 01:32:33,014
MARISHA: We've got some good stuff going. We've
got some good stuff going.

1239
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:37,183
MATT: Actually, as a note to remind you guys, too,
one of the cool things about Fifth Edition, two

1240
01:32:37,183 --> 01:32:40,527
things they did, they got rid of a lot of the
floating modifiers that previous editions had,

1241
01:32:40,527 --> 01:32:44,605
like you know Pathfinder was one, was a great
system but I found in battles, especially with a

1242
01:32:44,605 --> 01:32:48,146
lot of players, you'd be like, "All right, so I
get plus one to hit damage from the Bless spell,

1243
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:51,503
"and the bard gives everyone plus two to hit and
damage, oh no it's just hit, no it's to hit

1244
01:32:51,503 --> 01:32:54,776
"damage, okay, and you're going to plus one from
that ability, but only within ten feet of them--"

1245
01:32:54,776 --> 01:32:56,052
MARISHA: Don't forget Enhance Ability!

1246
01:32:56,052 --> 01:32:57,556
MATT: "Right, Enhance Ability, all right, is that
a plus two from--"

1247
01:32:57,556 --> 01:33:00,609
MARISHA: Hey don't forget, hey!

1248
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:03,071
MATT: "-- so it's plus seven to hit plus nine to
damage on that?"

1249
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:06,527
MARISHA: The Hunter's Mark. Hunter's Mark! Don't
forget Hunter's Mark!

1250
01:33:06,527 --> 01:33:08,017
MATT: Well, we still have that problem, but that's
Laura.

1251
01:33:08,017 --> 01:33:09,470
(laughter)

1252
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:13,366
MATT: But that became an issue with a lot of big
battles, I found, especially with eight players,

1253
01:33:13,366 --> 01:33:18,185
so they simplified that in this edition. Most
modifiers to hit and damage are pretty consistent.

1254
01:33:18,185 --> 01:33:23,495
You don't have a lot of crazy things. What they do
have is advantage and disadvantage. If an

1255
01:33:23,495 --> 01:33:29,121
experience or a circumstance in the game puts you
in an advantageous position, you get to roll two

1256
01:33:29,121 --> 01:33:34,348
d20s and drop the lowest, so you get the higher of
the two rolls. If you have disadvantage, you have

1257
01:33:34,348 --> 01:33:39,193
to roll 2d20 and drop the highest, which is rough.
So that's a really simplified way of kind of

1258
01:33:39,193 --> 01:33:43,508
playing spells to give you the advantage or get
enemies disadvantage in that circumstance, which

1259
01:33:43,508 --> 01:33:49,579
is great. Another big thing to consider for Fifth
Edition is, and you guys went over it a little

1260
01:33:49,579 --> 01:33:53,922
bit, backgrounds. Not necessary. Players that are
new to the game might find it very interesting,

1261
01:33:53,922 --> 01:33:57,517
but when you ask about your character's background
and what they've done, where they come from, and

1262
01:33:57,517 --> 01:34:01,009
how that builds them as a character, you can
completely come up with whatever you want to. You

1263
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:04,447
can say they came from this background, they did
these things, and this is all in my head in how I

1264
01:34:04,447 --> 01:34:07,974
plan the character. Some people either are having
a little bit of writer's block with their

1265
01:34:07,974 --> 01:34:11,806
character or they don't know where to start or
they just don't have a lot of experience, there's

1266
01:34:11,806 --> 01:34:15,902
a great section in the new Player's Handbook about
backgrounds, which you get to choose where your

1267
01:34:15,902 --> 01:34:18,961
character comes from, where they grew up. They
could be a folk hero, they can be a charlatan,

1268
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:25,548
they can be an acolyte, they can be a soldier from
a war long past. They can be an entertainer, and

1269
01:34:25,548 --> 01:34:30,520
that gives them bonus proficiencies in their
skills that pertain to their background, and it

1270
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:35,772
gives you examples of certain personality traits
that you can choose or randomly roll from. For

1271
01:34:35,829 --> 01:34:41,585
example, go to the background section of the
Player's Handbook over here, you can find-- where

1272
01:34:41,585 --> 01:34:42,411
is it?

1273
01:34:42,411 --> 01:34:45,513
MARISHA: Actually, Dan made his character with his
background this way.

1274
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,370
DAN: It's true.

1275
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:48,183
MARISHA: So we can just hear about his background
as an example.

1276
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:49,740
MATT: Right, so let's go ahead and hear about your
background, Dan.

1277
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:51,123
DAN: All right. (clears throat)

1278
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:52,564
MARISHA: But he did roll a dice to randomly
generate it.

1279
01:34:52,564 --> 01:34:57,478
DAN: I did. I generated it randomly. Flip the
appropriate page. (Scottish accent) So I'm Salty

1280
01:34:57,478 --> 01:35:04,018
Pete, the first mate of the Obsidian Helen. A
sailor by trade. A scoundrel by nature.

1281
01:35:04,018 --> 01:35:07,062
(laughter)

1282
01:35:07,062 --> 01:35:12,663
DAN: The captain gambled with the ship, so I fed
him to a long-beaked squid with razor-sharp teeth.

1283
01:35:12,663 --> 01:35:20,290
Spent times on pontoon cigarette boats, skiffs,
whoring, snoring and deploring across the land.

1284
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:24,135
I'm married to the sea but me best friend is a
hermit crab named Terrence.

1285
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,461
(laughter)

1286
01:35:26,461 --> 01:35:32,888
DAN: The only left-over I have from the Helen is
her flag, which I wear like a cape. I've met many

1287
01:35:32,888 --> 01:35:35,678
friends over a buttery glass of chardonnay,
sailor's choice.

1288
01:35:35,678 --> 01:35:37,857
(laughter)

1289
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:43,262
DAN: But I've lost many more. If you step to me,
you best come correct. I'm on a quest to regain

1290
01:35:43,262 --> 01:35:49,560
the Helen. I play for pink slips. Looking for
clues at the bottom of a glass, oh you bet your

1291
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:55,863
arse I did. And now I fell in with a failed
warlock named The Snugglelord.

1292
01:35:55,863 --> 01:36:00,291
(cheering)

1293
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:03,907
MATT: And all that of was based on randomly
generated information in the background section.

1294
01:36:03,907 --> 01:36:06,823
MARISHA: He clearly fleshed it out. Which is
incredible.

1295
01:36:06,823 --> 01:36:08,175
DAN: I added some flesh.

1296
01:36:08,175 --> 01:36:11,552
MATT: It gives you a great basis to build off of.
Like, I assume you were the sailor.

1297
01:36:11,607 --> 01:36:15,979
DAN: Yeah, I went for the sailor archetype. It's
super cool because I really liked stuff like that

1298
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:19,927
back when I used to do campaigns because it gives
you a great basis just for, you know, if you're not

1299
01:36:19,927 --> 01:36:23,764
sure what you want to do with your character, it
gives you good branching-off points and they you

1300
01:36:23,764 --> 01:36:26,095
can just sort of add meat to that skeleton.

1301
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:28,846
TALIESIN: Well, it's also one of the questions I
hear from like people who haven't played the game

1302
01:36:28,846 --> 01:36:31,653
before, when you first start with character
creation is like, well, what are the rules on what

1303
01:36:31,705 --> 01:36:37,782
I can be, and kind of trying to get them out of
that, there are no-- Forget about the rules. What

1304
01:36:37,782 --> 01:36:41,632
do you want to be? This is like, this gives them a
little set of rules that they can kind of grasp

1305
01:36:41,632 --> 01:36:43,970
onto desperately for like their first game.

1306
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:44,858
LIAM: We'll never--

1307
01:36:44,858 --> 01:36:46,088
MARISHA: Some of my favorite-- oh go ahead.

1308
01:36:46,088 --> 01:36:50,604
LIAM: But we'll never forget-- oh and I'm eating
chicken. You go ahead, I'm eating chicken.

1309
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:54,058
MARISHA: I'll go first. Some of my favorite
characters that I've played with have all been

1310
01:36:54,058 --> 01:37:00,232
people who decided what they wanted to be first
and then picked a race and a class around what

1311
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:07,019
they wanted to be, so our good friend Paradox
really wanted to be, like a roadie who--

1312
01:37:07,019 --> 01:37:08,440
(laughter)

1313
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,864
MARISHA: He wanted to be a roadie, essentially
like a traveling circus, who was like the curtain

1314
01:37:11,864 --> 01:37:19,541
guy for all these bands and so he made a monk who
had these ropes and he had a whip and all of his

1315
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:24,697
abilities he would grapple people and tie people
up with his ropes, and that was like what he

1316
01:37:24,697 --> 01:37:29,534
based, he had an idea first and then built a
character around. So, 'cause the system is so

1317
01:37:29,534 --> 01:37:33,562
flexible, you can-- it'll allow you to be pretty
much anything you want to be.

1318
01:37:33,562 --> 01:37:34,394
MATT: Yeah.

1319
01:37:34,394 --> 01:37:38,793
MARISHA: So, one of the things I like, in
Pathfinder there's like, you can make a geisha

1320
01:37:38,793 --> 01:37:44,094
dancer who did damage with fans, so you can pretty
much be whatever and then

1321
01:37:44,094 --> 01:37:45,192
figure it out from there.

1322
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:49,049
MATT: If it's not in the books, you can create it.
You can build it. We made the gunslinger off

1323
01:37:49,049 --> 01:37:53,353
Pathfinder here for that, so like, it's totally
open and the backgrounds are a great way. They

1324
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,642
have a whole section for personality traits and
you can roll for a personality trait, or multiple,

1325
01:37:56,642 --> 01:38:02,098
and ideals. So things that really drive your
character in their life. Bonds: things that really

1326
01:38:02,098 --> 01:38:08,022
hold them, you know, via loyalty or to an ideal
beyond that. And then flaws, which I love. Like

1327
01:38:08,022 --> 01:38:12,943
right here I rolled a two as a sailor. "I'd say
anything to avoid having to do extra work." That's

1328
01:38:12,943 --> 01:38:18,219
a great flaw for a sailor. Probably not great for
his work ethic, but you know. But those are really

1329
01:38:18,219 --> 01:38:21,604
useful things, the backgrounds is a really cool
addition for those who want a jumping point for

1330
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:25,408
building their characters' personality. Ah, let's
answer a few questions in the chat while we're

1331
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,884
going about this.

1332
01:38:26,884 --> 01:38:29,826
CREW: Manoose asked: "How do you handle magical
items?"

1333
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:31,707
MATT: How do you handle magical items?

1334
01:38:31,707 --> 01:38:34,056
TALIESIN, MARISHA, AND MATT: Very carefully.

1335
01:38:34,056 --> 01:38:37,298
MATT: The Dungeon Master Guide actually has a
really good breakdown about, in the magical items

1336
01:38:37,298 --> 01:38:42,255
section, about the cost and rarity of magical
items. I'm just going to pull it up here real

1337
01:38:42,255 --> 01:38:49,155
fast. There's common. Common magical items cost
between 50 to 100 gold pieces. And it says

1338
01:38:49,155 --> 01:38:54,022
"character level: first or higher". Uncommon, also
first or higher, but around 100 to 500 gold

1339
01:38:54,022 --> 01:39:00,469
pieces. Rare magical items are from fifth level or
higher, around 500 to 5,000 gold pieces. Then very

1340
01:39:00,469 --> 01:39:03,843
rare, and then legendary which get higher and
higher from there. Legendary being 50,000 gold

1341
01:39:03,843 --> 01:39:09,465
pieces and more. And so that helps you kinda gauge
how easy or hard it is for players to find

1342
01:39:09,465 --> 01:39:13,737
something of that level, and each one of the
magical items in the book tells you if it's rare,

1343
01:39:13,737 --> 01:39:18,605
uncommon, any of those type of circumstances.
However, it gives you a range, so you as the GM or

1344
01:39:18,605 --> 01:39:23,122
DM, you decide based on how powerful the item is,
how much it's worth if the players wanted to sell

1345
01:39:23,122 --> 01:39:28,454
it or buy it, and generally you consider if
players are selling magical items, they're selling

1346
01:39:28,454 --> 01:39:33,026
lower than they would buy it from, like any sort
of pawn shop-type thing, they might get a quarter

1347
01:39:33,026 --> 01:39:36,574
of what it's worth at a store, but if they're
really charismatic and they're really good with

1348
01:39:36,574 --> 01:39:40,689
their persuasion rolls they might be able to get
more money than that, or conversely lower the

1349
01:39:40,689 --> 01:39:45,154
price of items they want to buy. So, you wanna
make sure you don't want to give too out too many

1350
01:39:45,154 --> 01:39:48,865
items throughout the campaign quickly because then
the players either get too powerful, and then any

1351
01:39:48,865 --> 01:39:52,456
items you give them down the road seem not as
interesting or flippant. I like to run a campaign

1352
01:39:52,456 --> 01:39:57,946
that has, you know, occasional upgrades, just a
little slow trickle with bursts of good item use,

1353
01:39:57,946 --> 01:40:02,132
that way when you, they do find something truly
magical, it's a, "Aw, nice!" as opposed to, "Oh,

1354
01:40:02,132 --> 01:40:06,531
"it's another boots, who wants the boots? That's--
I've already got like three, here, you have that."

1355
01:40:06,531 --> 01:40:11,495
You know. It becomes less interesting and less
special to me, so I like to trickle them out and

1356
01:40:11,495 --> 01:40:15,933
keeping tabs on what players have, what they're
missing, and then eventually kind of incorporate

1357
01:40:15,933 --> 01:40:20,397
aspects of what they can upgrade their characters
with down the road. Or they can create them for

1358
01:40:20,397 --> 01:40:24,333
themselves. There are rules for creating magical
items if they have an arcane practice

1359
01:40:24,333 --> 01:40:25,926
to their class.

1360
01:40:25,926 --> 01:40:29,010
TALIESIN: We're sponsored by a store in-game,
too.

1361
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:31,638
MATT: You are sponsored by Gilmore's Glorious
Goods. Those of you, though you have not been

1362
01:40:31,638 --> 01:40:32,624
there yet, so--

1363
01:40:32,624 --> 01:40:34,253
MARISHA: Oh my God, I forgot we're sponsored by
them.

1364
01:40:34,253 --> 01:40:35,541
TALIESIN: We are sponsored by Gilmore.

1365
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:37,749
LIAM: Eventually, you will all have the pleasure
to meet Gilmore.

1366
01:40:37,749 --> 01:40:39,786
ORION: Gilmore is fantastic!

1367
01:40:39,786 --> 01:40:40,714
MARISHA: I love Gilmore.

1368
01:40:40,714 --> 01:40:41,720
ORION: Fantastic fellow.

1369
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,936
LIAM: He's a little sweet on me.

1370
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:44,446
MATT: Gilmore is a fan of Vax.

1371
01:40:44,446 --> 01:40:46,164
MARISHA: A little thing for Vax.

1372
01:40:46,164 --> 01:40:52,580
CREW: NSFThermont asks, "To what degree do you
allow/encourage the players to contribute to the

1373
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:53,984
world's lore?"

1374
01:40:53,984 --> 01:40:58,083
MATT: All right, so, how much do I allow the
players to contribute to lore? For their character

1375
01:40:58,083 --> 01:41:03,022
backgrounds, I like them to contribute a lot about
where they come from and what their stories are.

1376
01:41:03,022 --> 01:41:06,923
Everyone's backgrounds you see in the opening
videos, they wrote themselves, and then I take

1377
01:41:06,923 --> 01:41:11,517
those and I incorporate that into the world that
I'm creating. And occasionally they'll cross paths

1378
01:41:11,517 --> 01:41:16,076
with aspects of their personal history and in the
future will as well. Some of them will just be

1379
01:41:16,076 --> 01:41:20,985
breezing through encounters, some of them will
actually find moments in the story that will

1380
01:41:20,985 --> 01:41:29,906
directly be part of their personal goals, that
will, we shall see. I like the players to

1381
01:41:29,906 --> 01:41:36,184
incorporate aspects of their history, but beyond
that, I don't want them to flesh out too much of

1382
01:41:36,184 --> 01:41:40,874
their current or future aspects of the world
because to them that takes out some of the mystery.

1383
01:41:41,021 --> 01:41:44,896
What I think is great as a player is knowing where
you came from and not knowing where you're going.

1384
01:41:44,896 --> 01:41:47,633
So, like, for instance, Tiberius

1385
01:41:47,633 --> 01:41:52,790
ORION: Yeah, lot of you asked about my Mending
Wheel, 'cause I've used that a bunch. And the

1386
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:59,800
Mending Wheel is part of something that Tiberius'
personal quest is about, that I wrote and gave to

1387
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,920
Matthew. It's like this is--

1388
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:01,939
MATT: Like two years ago.

1389
01:42:01,939 --> 01:42:05,824
ORION: Yeah, it's like over two years now. Wow,
it's been a while. But I said, "Here, this is what

1390
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:14,813
"his goals are, this is why he's travelling with
this group of people." And that is like, when I

1391
01:42:14,813 --> 01:42:20,144
found that thing, he doesn't make it, you know,
very difficult, but he doesn't make it easy

1392
01:42:20,144 --> 01:42:24,689
either. Like when we came across it, there was
this NPC witch, right?

1393
01:42:24,689 --> 01:42:26,946
MATT: It was a hag. You heard me mention her
earlier.

1394
01:42:26,946 --> 01:42:31,997
ORION: And we had this interaction where he-- it
was about something else, our main quest that we

1395
01:42:31,997 --> 01:42:39,137
were doing and he said, he was describing her
place and he said something-something wheel.

1396
01:42:39,287 --> 01:42:44,419
Just, and was listing things, and I was like,
"Wait a minute, that's one of my things I think I

1397
01:42:44,419 --> 01:42:52,046
"wrote about!" And I then as Tiberius inquired
about it, then that became a conversation between

1398
01:42:52,190 --> 01:42:57,250
me and the NPC and I had to-- does that apply now?
Is that gone?

1399
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,398
TALIESIN: No, that's not gone.

1400
01:42:58,398 --> 01:42:59,282
ORION: (quietly) Oh, no.

1401
01:42:59,282 --> 01:43:01,197
MARISHA: That piece of fortune you handed over?

1402
01:43:01,197 --> 01:43:04,018
ORION: I had to negotiate some of my fortune
which, I still don't know what that means.

1403
01:43:04,018 --> 01:43:05,998
MARISHA: No, that's gonna fuck us so hard one of
these days.

1404
01:43:05,998 --> 01:43:07,436
TALIESIN: Oh, one of these days, it's just gonna
hurt.

1405
01:43:07,436 --> 01:43:12,098
ORION: But I had to give that to the witch NPC in
exchange for the Wheel of Mending, which is the

1406
01:43:12,098 --> 01:43:14,026
very important thing in my quest. So--

1407
01:43:14,026 --> 01:43:15,545
TALIESIN: And it's been helpful for everybody.

1408
01:43:15,545 --> 01:43:16,200
ORION: It's great.

1409
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,041
MARISHA: It's been very helpful.

1410
01:43:17,041 --> 01:43:18,138
ORION: It's been great.

1411
01:43:18,138 --> 01:43:19,902
MARISHA: One of these days though, you're gonna
like, get a--

1412
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:20,904
ORION: Really horrible--

1413
01:43:20,904 --> 01:43:23,591
MARISHA: You're going to roll a 20 and something
terrible is going to happen.

1414
01:43:23,591 --> 01:43:27,920
ORION: But the cool thing is, I didn't describe
what the wheel did. I named what they were and

1415
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:34,835
Matthew then decided if it, a) if it was existed,
b) what it did and, you know, how it worked and

1416
01:43:34,835 --> 01:43:37,027
all that stuff. So, that's-- it's cool.

1417
01:43:37,027 --> 01:43:41,345
TALIESIN: You know, having details but having the
DM-- giving the DM discretion to decide how it

1418
01:43:41,345 --> 01:43:43,371
plays out is really awesome.

1419
01:43:43,371 --> 01:43:44,360
ORION AND MARISHA: Yeah.

1420
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:48,058
ORION: Because then I'm surprised and I'm the one
expecting to see it. I'm still surprised,

1421
01:43:48,118 --> 01:43:49,149
and it's great.

1422
01:43:49,149 --> 01:43:53,500
MATT: Well, like, well, for instance, the city you
came from: Draconia. The society-- you've given me

1423
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:57,400
a lot of information about how you grew up there
and kind of how you saw this society and then you

1424
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:03,065
sent me that outline and now I'm taking what you
had come up with and I'm fleshing it out and

1425
01:44:03,065 --> 01:44:07,922
building it into the world and then running with
that essentially, so, Tiberius's memory serves

1426
01:44:07,922 --> 01:44:12,066
right to what his experience was in Draconia,
we'll see how that continues going forward when he

1427
01:44:12,066 --> 01:44:14,201
eventually returns to his people. So--

1428
01:44:14,201 --> 01:44:18,882
MARISHA: And I did something similar with like, my
four tribes of the Ashari. You know, I've got,

1429
01:44:18,882 --> 01:44:22,687
I've got the fire tribe and the earth tribe and
the air tribe and the water tribe, but from

1430
01:44:22,687 --> 01:44:29,150
Keyleth's perspective, I'm from the air tribe, I
don't really know a whole lot about the other

1431
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:35,104
ones. They're there, so I gave him the idea of the
tribes and the backstory that they exist and now

1432
01:44:35,104 --> 01:44:36,769
he's fleshing it out for me.

1433
01:44:36,769 --> 01:44:40,552
TALIESIN: Yeah, and like, I don't know what the
people who came to my parents' castle wanted. They

1434
01:44:40,552 --> 01:44:44,698
were looking for something and like, I gave him
details on what they were doing, but not

1435
01:44:44,698 --> 01:44:49,213
necessarily what it was all about because I don't
know, but he knows, because he gets

1436
01:44:49,213 --> 01:44:50,750
to figure that out.

1437
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:52,023
MATT: Yeah. It's fun.

1438
01:44:52,023 --> 01:44:56,006
LIAM: Laura and I spent three hours in a diner
fleshing out our family history.

1439
01:44:56,006 --> 01:44:57,270
MARISHA: That's so cool.

1440
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:58,791
LIAM: It was great. It was great.

1441
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:02,431
MATT: Then you ran into your estranged father and
his new family. (laughs)

1442
01:45:02,431 --> 01:45:03,762
TALIESIN: Oh, that was so great.

1443
01:45:03,762 --> 01:45:07,503
ORION: Yeah, that was like, their father was a big part
of one of our main quests. It was insane.

1444
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:09,054
LIAM: It was very frosty.

1445
01:45:09,054 --> 01:45:11,775
MARISHA: It was very frosty, yeah.

1446
01:45:11,775 --> 01:45:18,208
CREW: Skyfalls1 asks a specific about Trinket. I'm
just gonna generalize the question. How do you

1447
01:45:18,208 --> 01:45:24,342
handle player-controlled allies and their level
progression? Are they part of the character who

1448
01:45:24,342 --> 01:45:29,014
controls that ally, such as Trinket being the
bear, a familiar or something. Or do they have

1449
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,367
their own independent leveling guide?

1450
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:35,683
MATT: For this system, and it's different from
system to system, in this system, that companion

1451
01:45:35,683 --> 01:45:41,124
Trinket is part of the ranger class, the
beastmaster that Laura went into, and Trinket's

1452
01:45:41,124 --> 01:45:46,639
progression is tied towards her progression. As
her level gets higher, Trinket will have more hit

1453
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:51,525
points, Trinket will gain better bonuses to his
attacks as her proficiency bonus gets higher. So

1454
01:45:51,525 --> 01:45:59,065
Trinket will advance pretty much alongside Vax--
or Vex. You're not wearing your shirt. Shh.

1455
01:45:59,065 --> 01:46:00,522
(laughter)

1456
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:02,073
ORION: You need to always just wear that shirt.

1457
01:46:02,073 --> 01:46:03,006
MARISHA: See, I'm not the only one.

1458
01:46:03,006 --> 01:46:04,528
TALIESIN: Gonna get a tattoo.

1459
01:46:04,528 --> 01:46:08,956
MATT: I'm usually very good about that. It's been
a long week. I always say that. But yeah, so

1460
01:46:08,956 --> 01:46:14,591
player-controlled PCs like that-- those are tied
to the class. As far as NPCs that I control that

1461
01:46:14,591 --> 01:46:20,743
aren't part of the party, those I keep tabs on
separately entirely, so. We can get a few more

1462
01:46:20,743 --> 01:46:21,622
questions in here.

1463
01:46:21,622 --> 01:46:24,369
MARISHA: Don't saw off Ify's arm. Don't-- nope.

1464
01:46:24,369 --> 01:46:25,494
MATT: He needs that.

1465
01:46:25,494 --> 01:46:27,736
DAN: Just some real chill LARPing.

1466
01:46:27,736 --> 01:46:29,066
MARISHA: Put it down.

1467
01:46:29,066 --> 01:46:30,636
LIAM: How will he make himself happy at night?

1468
01:46:30,636 --> 01:46:32,684
MARISHA: Drop it. Drop it.

1469
01:46:32,684 --> 01:46:34,252
LIAM: That's the good hand.

1470
01:46:34,252 --> 01:46:38,089
ORION: While we're waiting, I'd like to address a
couple things that I've been tweeted at about

1471
01:46:38,089 --> 01:46:47,144
roleplay, and what I think about roleplay, and how
I'm super hardcore about it. I always tell people

1472
01:46:47,144 --> 01:46:53,190
who's kinda like wanted-- my friends who are like,
"I have no idea what that is," and I was like, the

1473
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:59,627
best I can explain how I roleplay is as soon as I
sit down, and as soon as he says the narration and

1474
01:46:59,627 --> 01:47:06,587
then we get into it, I immediately just pretend
I'm like 12 years old again. And I'm this guy, I'm

1475
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:11,773
this kid and I have my-- or ten or 11--
however, I don't know age anymore-- ten.

1476
01:47:11,916 --> 01:47:12,692
TALIESIN: Seven.

1477
01:47:12,692 --> 01:47:13,498
LIAM: 11 and a half.

1478
01:47:13,498 --> 01:47:14,195
MARISHA: 12.

1479
01:47:14,195 --> 01:47:16,477
ORION: Where imagination is the strongest. Where I
put on my sheet, and wrap it around and that's my

1480
01:47:16,477 --> 01:47:19,677
cape, and I have my flashlight and that's my
lightsaber or whatever the hell and I go outside

1481
01:47:19,677 --> 01:47:24,091
and play 'til my mom comes to go have dinner or
whatever, and I'm dirty as hell when I come back

1482
01:47:24,091 --> 01:47:27,897
inside. Everybody's done that, we've all been
kids.

1483
01:47:27,897 --> 01:47:29,426
MARISHA: Well, that was like two weeks ago for
you.

1484
01:47:29,426 --> 01:47:32,726
ORION: I'm just saying. Also, when I play D&D.

1485
01:47:32,726 --> 01:47:34,411
TALIESIN: I'm wearing my underoos right now.

1486
01:47:34,411 --> 01:47:38,129
ORION: That's where I go. It's just-- when
everybody's not thinking about any kind of thing

1487
01:47:38,129 --> 01:47:44,344
other than having fun, that's my best advice. To
just kinda roleplay. Just have fun.

1488
01:47:44,344 --> 01:47:47,964
TALIESIN: And I'll say something that actually
came out. I was very, very proud of this that this

1489
01:47:47,964 --> 01:47:52,336
came up recently in some conversations, as we were
talking about the nature of playing a game like

1490
01:47:52,336 --> 01:47:59,068
this and about risk. And as a player, wanting to
be adventurous and wanting to do things you

1491
01:47:59,068 --> 01:48:03,474
wouldn't do in real life. And one of the essential
things that a good DM, that you get to learn with

1492
01:48:03,474 --> 01:48:08,772
a good DM, is the DM is not there to kill you. The
DM is there to turn you into a hero.

1493
01:48:08,772 --> 01:48:13,593
ORION: Um, by the way, I have been playing this
wrong all the time

1494
01:48:13,593 --> 01:48:14,555
TALIESIN: I'm just kidding!

1495
01:48:14,555 --> 01:48:15,185
(laughter)

1496
01:48:15,185 --> 01:48:16,455
TALIESIN: You play awesome, shut up!

1497
01:48:16,455 --> 01:48:17,818
ORION: Because-- no, 'cause we had this
conversation yesterday.

1498
01:48:17,818 --> 01:48:19,596
TALIESIN: Just like, we were gonna die and he
doesn't want to kill us. (laughs)

1499
01:48:19,596 --> 01:48:23,205
ORION: And I was like, "I don't understand!
Mercer's trying to kill us all the time!" And he's

1500
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:28,727
like, "You're wrong! He wants to make you a hero,"
and I'm like, "What?"

1501
01:48:28,727 --> 01:48:31,271
(laughter)

1502
01:48:31,271 --> 01:48:34,181
ORION: But that means everything-- I've been such
a dick!

1503
01:48:34,181 --> 01:48:36,578
TALIESIN: He's hilarious.

1504
01:48:36,578 --> 01:48:38,697
MATT: Some DMs do want to kill you

1505
01:48:38,697 --> 01:48:39,976
TALIESIN AND ORION: Some DMs do.

1506
01:48:39,976 --> 01:48:46,173
MATT: Which is fine, as long as the DMs and
players agree upon that at the beginning. And

1507
01:48:46,173 --> 01:48:50,310
they're like, "This is the relationship. I'm
trying to kill you guys. Good luck surviving."

1508
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:55,478
Like Tomb of Horrors. It's a perfect example of
Gygax going "Fuck all y'all! You're gonna die."

1509
01:48:55,478 --> 01:49:00,460
That's where that stems from, and for some people
that's a lot of fun. But for this game, death is

1510
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:03,818
very real, challenge is there, and I present
circumstances that, depending on what you guys do,

1511
01:49:03,818 --> 01:49:09,545
may or may not end in success or death. But I'm
not trying to outwardly kill you. Usually.

1512
01:49:09,545 --> 01:49:11,308
MARISHA: He's not trying to outwardly kill you.

1513
01:49:11,308 --> 01:49:19,114
ZAC: Spiritually kill you. Obviously it's had some
effect on you.

1514
01:49:19,114 --> 01:49:20,929
TALIESIN: He's God, it's scary!

1515
01:49:20,929 --> 01:49:22,272
MARISHA: He is scary.

1516
01:49:22,272 --> 01:49:25,101
ORION: It's just like an armored, fucking
enchanted horned beholder motherfucker. Yeah sure,

1517
01:49:25,101 --> 01:49:27,078
he's not totally trying to kill us.

1518
01:49:27,078 --> 01:49:28,372
MARISHA: We say "fear the wrath of god" for a
reason.

1519
01:49:28,372 --> 01:49:33,627
TALIESIN: If a giant god appeared tomorrow, and
like just pulled out a d20 and rolled it and

1520
01:49:33,686 --> 01:49:37,210
looked at you, you'd freak out. That's a really
scary thing to happen.

1521
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:42,316
ORION: But it is a good point, like, I should've
been more-- I shouldn't have been

1522
01:49:42,316 --> 01:49:43,821
so fearful as I was.

1523
01:49:43,821 --> 01:49:46,577
TALIESIN: It's just a different way at looking at
the situation.

1524
01:49:46,577 --> 01:49:48,211
ORION: I'm literally thinking, "He's--"

1525
01:49:48,211 --> 01:49:49,786
TALIESIN: I know, because he gets that look.

1526
01:49:49,786 --> 01:49:51,108
MATT: It's part of the fun.

1527
01:49:51,108 --> 01:49:52,604
TALIESIN: His smile is so terrifying.

1528
01:49:52,604 --> 01:49:54,763
LIAM: I think I play-- I court death on purpose.

1529
01:49:54,763 --> 01:49:55,759
(laughter)

1530
01:49:55,759 --> 01:50:02,095
LIAM: The way I look at this is, either this month
or next year, my character's going to die, I know

1531
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:06,229
that's going to happen, and I would never grab a
rope and jump off the side of a flying device to

1532
01:50:06,229 --> 01:50:08,916
save my actual sister. Yes I would.

1533
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:09,764
MATT: Yeah you would.

1534
01:50:09,764 --> 01:50:11,503
LIAM: Yes I would. That's a terrible statement.
Yes I would.

1535
01:50:11,503 --> 01:50:12,622
(laughter)

1536
01:50:12,622 --> 01:50:17,182
LIAM: But I don't think that I would leap off of
things to my detriment constantly, and like,

1537
01:50:17,182 --> 01:50:21,841
that's the whole reason we're doing this, is
'cause we're 12 and we get to pretend we're the

1538
01:50:21,841 --> 01:50:25,535
heroes, so I'm constantly trying-- I fully expect
you to kill me someday.

1539
01:50:25,535 --> 01:50:27,829
MATT: It may happen and I'm gonna feel horrible.

1540
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:33,310
MARISHA: D&D has a lot of life lessons in it.
We're all gonna die someday. YOLO.

1541
01:50:33,358 --> 01:50:35,851
TALIESIN: Three ranks in YOLO.

1542
01:50:40,081 --> 01:50:44,193
MATT: You can be as careful as you want in a game,
but you get to a certain point where you have to

1543
01:50:44,252 --> 01:50:48,447
have those hero moments where you take that
high-risk, high-reward--

1544
01:50:48,447 --> 01:50:51,296
MARISHA: It sounds like you're being a little bit
racist right now.

1545
01:50:51,296 --> 01:50:55,497
LIAM: Hold on, hold on, hey, shush. Say that
again.

1546
01:50:55,497 --> 01:51:01,487
MATT: Being careful is great and working your way
through a situation carefully is fantastic, but

1547
01:51:01,487 --> 01:51:04,460
you reach a certain point in a game where you have
to let yourself jump into those high-risk

1548
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:08,173
high-reward circumstances, because not only is
that what you don't get to do in your day-to-day

1549
01:51:08,173 --> 01:51:13,315
life, but those make the best stories, success or
failure. There might be serious ramifications for

1550
01:51:13,315 --> 01:51:17,516
failure, but god damn if you won't be talking
about it for the next two or three, ten years, for

1551
01:51:17,516 --> 01:51:21,375
the one time that you did this and it failed and
your character got smashed in this horrible way,

1552
01:51:21,375 --> 01:51:27,082
and two years after, your party would clamor to
the gods your lost character's name whenever they

1553
01:51:27,082 --> 01:51:31,335
charged into battle against a great foe. Like,
that's the kind of storytelling you don't get

1554
01:51:31,335 --> 01:51:33,093
unless someone takes a risk like that.

1555
01:51:33,093 --> 01:51:37,562
MARISHA: By the way, when one of us dies, we're
all gonna fucking bawl our eyes out.

1556
01:51:37,562 --> 01:51:38,518
ORION: I know.

1557
01:51:38,518 --> 01:51:39,326
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

1558
01:51:39,326 --> 01:51:40,466
MARISHA: It's sad.

1559
01:51:40,466 --> 01:51:43,400
TALIESIN: But Scanlan and the stained-glass window
will live with me forever.

1560
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:46,738
ZAC: I'm gonna feel really bad laughing from the
back of the room when that happens.

1561
01:51:46,738 --> 01:51:50,707
Haha, this is great.

1562
01:51:50,707 --> 01:51:53,082
LIAM: You're wearing a unicorn suit!

1563
01:51:53,082 --> 01:51:57,258
CREW: So I'm gonna do two more.

1564
01:51:57,258 --> 01:51:58,554
MATT: Two more questions, okay.

1565
01:51:58,554 --> 01:52:02,402
CREW: First one, I can't remember who's asking it,
but I've seen it a couple times. They're asking

1566
01:52:02,402 --> 01:52:06,507
about DM player characters. Your opinion on DM
PCs.

1567
01:52:06,507 --> 01:52:15,007
MATT: DM PCs, if they're a very good DM, can be
fine. I, honestly, the main reason I became a DM

1568
01:52:15,007 --> 01:52:22,027
was because my first DM had a PC who then somehow
got all the best loot, and was a paladin in Second

1569
01:52:22,027 --> 01:52:27,518
Edition but also somehow had the samurai kit,
which I don't know if that can be a paladin, so he

1570
01:52:27,518 --> 01:52:30,974
was dual-wielding magical katanas, and whenever an
upgrade came up that he randomly rolled on the

1571
01:52:30,974 --> 01:52:34,088
table, he went, "Oh, cool, I'm taking that." Dude,
I don't even have a magical weapon. He's like,

1572
01:52:34,088 --> 01:52:38,024
"I'll fight you for it." I'm like, oh, good
paladin, fuck this shit, I'll make my own game.

1573
01:52:38,024 --> 01:52:43,210
Sorry, Ray, I love you, but that was a terrible
game.

1574
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:46,609
(laughter)

1575
01:52:46,609 --> 01:52:51,934
MATT: But I think if it's a good DM you can, but
the problem is, as a Dungeon Master, you know

1576
01:52:51,934 --> 01:52:55,431
behind the scenes, you know where it's going, you
know what's coming, you know what you're gonna

1577
01:52:55,431 --> 01:52:59,346
fight, you know what to prepare for, you know
what's gonna drop, you know so much that having a

1578
01:52:59,346 --> 01:53:02,564
player character almost defeats the purpose.

1579
01:53:02,706 --> 01:53:05,154
LIAM: Almost? Completely. Completely defeats the
purpose.

1580
01:53:05,154 --> 01:53:08,548
MATT: There are circumstances where it might work
with certain creative types, but I think it robs

1581
01:53:08,548 --> 01:53:12,355
you of the fun of actually being a player in the
game if you're also the DM. Conversely, it also--

1582
01:53:12,355 --> 01:53:15,716
MARISHA: Well, you also, I mean, you have this
handy screen deliberately so we don't see what

1583
01:53:15,716 --> 01:53:16,804
you're doing.

1584
01:53:16,804 --> 01:53:20,485
MATT: Conversely, the other players feel removed,
then, because they have this strange magical

1585
01:53:20,485 --> 01:53:24,164
god-entity that also is fighting alongside them
that has the benefit of knowing what's coming.

1586
01:53:24,164 --> 01:53:29,560
DAN: Sort of a tangent to that question. How do
you feel about another player playing someone

1587
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,775
else's character by proxy when that other player's
not there?

1588
01:53:32,775 --> 01:53:37,554
MATT: I think that's totally fine if the players
agree upon it. I tend to just NPC players if

1589
01:53:37,554 --> 01:53:41,140
they're not there, or try to find a story reason
as to why they can't be available so it doesn't

1590
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:45,522
rob them of the experience, but that is totally a
viable thing, as long as the players agree to it.

1591
01:53:45,522 --> 01:53:49,167
Or if the person was a real ass last game and
they're not there, like, you know what, fine, you

1592
01:53:49,167 --> 01:53:50,301
control the character.

1593
01:53:50,301 --> 01:53:51,179
(laughter)

1594
01:53:51,179 --> 01:53:54,468
MATT: See how they like that. But for the most
part, if players are okay with that, and there's

1595
01:53:54,468 --> 01:53:58,274
somebody at the table that they trust to
understand what the character would do to play

1596
01:53:58,274 --> 01:54:01,020
them properly, then fuck yeah, go for it. Great.

1597
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:03,259
ORION: Matthew, that's why I'm going to be showing
up next week.

1598
01:54:03,259 --> 01:54:04,195
MATT: Okay.

1599
01:54:04,195 --> 01:54:05,509
ORION: I will be. I'll be here.

1600
01:54:05,509 --> 01:54:14,194
CREW: So, for the last question, "I want players
at my table to be more--" This is CometCalvin, by

1601
01:54:14,194 --> 01:54:18,418
the way. "I want my table to be more immersed in
the story, like instead of saying to me, 'So I

1602
01:54:18,418 --> 01:54:25,078
"'tell them to go west.' Are there any tips on
stimulating people?" To rephrase it, how do you

1603
01:54:25,267 --> 01:54:30,937
encourage people to roleplay more and get into
character rather than simply just direct commands

1604
01:54:30,937 --> 01:54:32,022
at each other?

1605
01:54:32,022 --> 01:54:37,942
MATT: Right, right. So to get people to roleplay,
for one thing I wanna mention, it's not necessary.

1606
01:54:37,942 --> 01:54:39,987
If you want that in a game, that's different.

1607
01:54:39,987 --> 01:54:41,785
MARISHA: Bullshit.

1608
01:54:41,785 --> 01:54:44,429
LIAM: There it is.

1609
01:54:44,429 --> 01:54:50,240
MARISHA: It's a roleplaying game. It's in the
title. Come on.

1610
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,734
MATT: Let me clarify.

1611
01:54:51,734 --> 01:54:53,289
MARISHA: Go ahead.

1612
01:54:53,289 --> 01:55:01,629
MATT: Some people don't have the comfort level or
have the social confidence to be able to jump

1613
01:55:01,629 --> 01:55:06,118
straight into character. And so for them, it's
more comfortable to play it that way, where they

1614
01:55:06,118 --> 01:55:10,951
can remove themselves from the character and
control them almost like a video game and say what

1615
01:55:10,951 --> 01:55:14,585
they're doing as opposed to actually performing
and acting it out. And there's nothing wrong with

1616
01:55:14,585 --> 01:55:18,018
that. If anything, that's almost a baby-step
version of them eventually becoming comfortable

1617
01:55:18,018 --> 01:55:21,873
with fully immersing themselves in the character.
So I don't think that you should be down on

1618
01:55:21,873 --> 01:55:26,176
somebody who plays that way necessarily. If you
want to immerse them more as a DM, it's an

1619
01:55:26,176 --> 01:55:30,342
invitation. You mention to the players, guys,
going forward, I would love for us to be a little

1620
01:55:30,446 --> 01:55:35,445
more into the circumstance. If you're feeling
comfortable, please feel free to speak in

1621
01:55:35,635 --> 01:55:40,988
character, or sometimes, if they're down for it
but they have a hard time committing, put the law

1622
01:55:41,033 --> 01:55:47,362
down. Anything you say in this game is in
character if it's conversational. To where if they

1623
01:55:47,362 --> 01:55:50,712
turn to somebody on the side and be like, "I can't
believe you stabbed them in the back," be like,

1624
01:55:50,712 --> 01:55:55,387
"I'm sorry, what did you say?" And then you start
treating everything as character conversation,

1625
01:55:55,387 --> 01:55:59,854
then they are put into a circumstance where they
have to treat it like that. It may not be

1626
01:55:59,897 --> 01:56:04,686
comfortable at first, but just like getting into
the very, very cold water in a pool, at first it

1627
01:56:04,686 --> 01:56:08,686
sucks, but over time they get used to it and they
don't realize that they're there anymore after a

1628
01:56:08,686 --> 01:56:13,810
while, you know, it just becomes natural. But for
you as a Dungeon Master, you really have to, it's

1629
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:17,520
an invitation, a comfortable invitation, please
come with me on this, I'd love to have you be more

1630
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:23,145
involved in this, and it's your job as the Dungeon
Master to also bring your NPCs to life in the way

1631
01:56:23,145 --> 01:56:26,558
you want them to roleplay, and when you ask them a
question, don't ask it out to the whole group,

1632
01:56:26,558 --> 01:56:31,089
pick somebody in the group that NPC's looking to
and go, "You! What are you doing in my tavern?"

1633
01:56:31,089 --> 01:56:34,941
LIAM: I was just passing by, I thought I could
have a drink.

1634
01:56:34,941 --> 01:56:38,932
MATT: "Yet your eyes seem to belie some sort of
strange negative connotation. You carry a blade

1635
01:56:39,081 --> 01:56:41,729
"out of its scabbard. What is it you want with my
belongings?"

1636
01:56:41,729 --> 01:56:45,293
LIAM: Nothing, my father gave it to me, I was just
thirsty and passing through-- okay!

1637
01:56:45,338 --> 01:56:46,495
MATT: "Your father."

1638
01:56:46,495 --> 01:56:52,079
LIAM: My father's name was Arthis. He was a potter
and he asked me to come to you and ask you for

1639
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:54,362
your allegiance to our clan.

1640
01:56:54,362 --> 01:56:57,143
MATT: "That's all you had to say. Come have a seat,
we'll discuss this clan's allegiance."

1641
01:56:57,143 --> 01:56:59,471
LIAM: You're a very nice fellow. Could I also have
a drink?

1642
01:56:59,471 --> 01:57:01,340
MATT: "For a gold piece you can."

1643
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:04,416
LIAM: Here's two, here's two, I'm rich.

1644
01:57:04,416 --> 01:57:06,379
(laughter)

1645
01:57:06,379 --> 01:57:11,446
MATT: "I see you speak tavern well." So like,
that's a circumstance where you've kind of put

1646
01:57:11,446 --> 01:57:15,931
them on the spot and they have to react to it, and
like I said, it might be weird at first, but

1647
01:57:15,931 --> 01:57:20,342
they'll eventually get into the deal. That's my
suggestion. It might not always work, some people

1648
01:57:20,342 --> 01:57:22,917
just aren't comfortable with that, and you have to
be okay with it.

1649
01:57:22,917 --> 01:57:26,572
TALIESIN: You do setting really well, too. Like,
when we would play, the lights go down, the

1650
01:57:26,572 --> 01:57:28,605
candles come out, the music turns on.

1651
01:57:28,605 --> 01:57:32,880
MATT: That's one thing I do miss about this
situation is, it's hard to adjust the lighting

1652
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,271
based on circumstances.

1653
01:57:34,271 --> 01:57:37,262
ZAC: We're working on it, man, all right? We're
working on it! We're getting there!

1654
01:57:37,262 --> 01:57:38,472
MATT: It's all good.

1655
01:57:38,472 --> 01:57:39,864
LIAM: In a dark fantastical cave--

1656
01:57:39,864 --> 01:57:40,895
ZAC: We're working on it.

1657
01:57:40,895 --> 01:57:43,158
LIAM: -- also known as Travis's dining room.

1658
01:57:43,158 --> 01:57:45,020
(laughter)

1659
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:47,901
ORION: But we put a nice tablecloth on the table.

1660
01:57:47,901 --> 01:57:53,799
LIAM: Can't you also use, I'm DMing for my
eight-year-old son and these kids, I haven't done

1661
01:57:53,799 --> 01:57:58,991
this yet, but the DM book talks about rewarding
them with inspiration dice, so can't you like, as

1662
01:57:58,991 --> 01:58:04,962
a carrot, just start, anytime anyone shows even
just the barest glimpse of roleplaying like that,

1663
01:58:04,962 --> 01:58:06,565
go boom, inspiration dice to you.

1664
01:58:06,565 --> 01:58:10,014
MATT: Yep, yes. I mentioned that a little earlier,
and I'll expand upon that. On top of making sure

1665
01:58:10,014 --> 01:58:13,893
people get bonuses and little bumps for cool
experience moments, if someone does something

1666
01:58:13,893 --> 01:58:18,669
really cool in character, you as the DM can reward
them a d6 as an inspiration dice. An inspiration

1667
01:58:18,669 --> 01:58:23,777
dice-- and they can only carry one at any given
time-- but at some point later in the game, if

1668
01:58:23,777 --> 01:58:31,194
they have to make a d20 roll, like an attack or a
saving throw or a skill check, they can add the d6

1669
01:58:31,194 --> 01:58:36,534
to their final number to give them that extra
little hero push towards succeeding at something.

1670
01:58:36,534 --> 01:58:41,342
So it's another cool kind of carrot-on-a-stick
bait to step a little harder into their character

1671
01:58:41,342 --> 01:58:50,214
and really play out that role. Good point, Liam.
We may have time for one more quick one, since

1672
01:58:50,214 --> 01:58:53,794
there were a lot of questions coming through, and
then we'll jump into the game.

1673
01:58:53,794 --> 01:58:56,879
MARISHA: I will say, while you're looking for a
question--

1674
01:58:56,879 --> 01:59:01,435
CREW: When's there gonna be another shirt? Are you
guys planning on doing another--

1675
01:59:01,435 --> 01:59:05,919
MATT: We're planning to do more shirts. Geek and
Sundry's putting up their actual store soon, and

1676
01:59:05,919 --> 01:59:07,640
so we're going to be--

1677
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:12,460
ZAC: I would like to take this time to say that we
do have shirts for sale right now that support

1678
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:18,153
Geek and Sundry's overall Twitch channel, if you'd
like to purchase some. They are the HR emote human

1679
01:59:18,153 --> 01:59:25,321
resources stapler for whenever you say something
inappropriate like 'penis'. There you go. You have

1680
01:59:25,321 --> 01:59:26,954
a shirt for that.

1681
01:59:26,954 --> 01:59:28,042
ORION: That's inappropriate? Penis?

1682
01:59:28,042 --> 01:59:29,034
ZAC: Well, I mean.

1683
01:59:29,034 --> 01:59:30,381
DAN: In this context? Yeah.

1684
01:59:30,381 --> 01:59:31,981
(laughter)

1685
01:59:31,981 --> 01:59:33,001
LIAM: We're playing a board game.

1686
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:34,488
ZAC: Depending on where you put it.

1687
01:59:34,488 --> 01:59:35,497
ORION: Oh, sure.

1688
01:59:35,497 --> 01:59:40,371
MARISHA: Yeah, just like real life. Anyway.

1689
01:59:40,371 --> 01:59:47,158
MATT: I saw one good question I wanted to address.
Someone asked, suggestions on running a complex

1690
01:59:47,158 --> 01:59:57,417
system for a bunch of new players? Which is a
challenge, even sometimes in our game still. But

1691
01:59:57,417 --> 02:00:02,488
it's one of those circumstances where you have to
be patient. And honestly, you can simplify the

1692
02:00:02,488 --> 02:00:06,249
rules. When I say you can customize anything in
this book, you can leave out a lot of the rules

1693
02:00:06,249 --> 02:00:11,040
and just keep it very simple. If you don't want to
have, if you think a movement, an action, and a

1694
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:14,947
bonus action's too much? Get rid of the bonus
action and just consider things, find another way

1695
02:00:14,947 --> 02:00:22,028
to work it in. Or if you want to keep it a little
more free-form and just keep it open to-- it puts

1696
02:00:22,028 --> 02:00:24,940
a little more work on you as the DM to do so, so
you have to rationalize what they're doing so it

1697
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:28,762
doesn't seem so broken, but you can just minimize
a lot of the rules, you can cut out half the

1698
02:00:28,762 --> 02:00:32,540
skills if you don't think they're necessary. You
can get rid of feats, you can get rid of

1699
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:38,899
backgrounds. You can halve the spell lists, if you
want. If you want to narrow it down, you can go

1700
02:00:38,899 --> 02:00:42,878
through and trim and trim and trim until you think
you have a nice, simpler system for everyone to

1701
02:00:42,878 --> 02:00:48,129
start with, and then you can start rolling out the
more expanded aspects of the system. So don't feel

1702
02:00:48,129 --> 02:00:53,107
like you have to verbatim hand everyone this book
and be, read it all, let's go! You can go ahead

1703
02:00:53,107 --> 02:00:58,068
and pick the few rules you think are important to
play the game, teach them to your group and just

1704
02:00:58,068 --> 02:01:02,532
start with those, and then slowly as time goes on
let them research and discover more

1705
02:01:02,532 --> 02:01:03,608
as they go on.

1706
02:01:03,608 --> 02:01:04,580
LIAM: And learn together.

1707
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:05,404
MATT: Yeah.

1708
02:01:05,404 --> 02:01:10,591
ORION: To what you're saying, too, what Matthew, I
don't how to say this. What Matthew allows me to

1709
02:01:10,591 --> 02:01:18,121
do is, for all you casters out there, if the spell
isn't in the book, ask your DM if you can craft

1710
02:01:18,121 --> 02:01:23,966
them. I've-- Matthew has-- if it doesn't exist,
he's let me make spells. That's what Glacial Blast

1711
02:01:23,966 --> 02:01:28,429
is, it doesn't exist here but I was like, hey, I
wanna do this thing that doesn't quite, isn't

1712
02:01:28,429 --> 02:01:32,417
described in here, so you can ask your DM and he
can figure it out with you. I of course always

1713
02:01:32,417 --> 02:01:37,639
give him way-too-OP stuff, he's like no, and then
he gives me an actual spell. It works.

1714
02:01:37,639 --> 02:01:41,440
TALIESIN: Everything I build is literally just me
handing him a slip of paper going eh? Eh?

1715
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:47,081
MATT: And the players, as they submit custom
things, they have to understand that you do your

1716
02:01:47,081 --> 02:01:50,839
best to balance it, and if they try it out a few
times and it's still kind of overbalanced, it

1717
02:01:50,839 --> 02:01:53,484
might be scaled back a bit, 'cause you're still
trying to find what works and you can't really

1718
02:01:53,484 --> 02:01:57,462
tell how balanced something is until you try it.
But that's kind of the relationship you establish

1719
02:01:57,462 --> 02:02:01,512
with your DM if you want to customize and create
things on your own, is like, can I do this? Sure,

1720
02:02:01,512 --> 02:02:06,310
but make it like this. Okay, let's try that. Play
a few games. Yeah, it's a little powerful, we're

1721
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:09,777
gonna scale this back a little bit, and don't be
like, come on! You said it was okay! Be like,

1722
02:02:09,777 --> 02:02:11,218
okay, okay, cool.

1723
02:02:11,218 --> 02:02:19,227
DAN: Also, earlier, talking about customizing
monsters for the encounter. It's either in the DM

1724
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:27,295
guide or the Monster Manual, there is an algorithm
in there to properly scale a monster up and down

1725
02:02:27,295 --> 02:02:31,516
to fit the needs of the dungeon. I don't know where
it is in there, so that's a tool that they do

1726
02:02:31,574 --> 02:02:32,625
allow you to have.

1727
02:02:32,625 --> 02:02:33,735
MATT: It's in the book, it's nice.

1728
02:02:33,735 --> 02:02:34,868
DAN: It is in the Monster Manual?

1729
02:02:34,868 --> 02:02:35,819
MATT: I think so, yeah.

1730
02:02:35,819 --> 02:02:38,957
DAN: I think so. I was trying to-- I remember
flipping through it, I knew it was one of those. I

1731
02:02:38,957 --> 02:02:39,998
just wanted to mention that.

1732
02:02:39,998 --> 02:02:42,028
LIAM: It's in the Facebook terms of service.

1733
02:02:42,028 --> 02:02:48,796
DAN: Page 94, section A-3.

1734
02:02:48,796 --> 02:02:53,065
MATT: All righty. So let's go ahead and--

1735
02:02:53,065 --> 02:02:56,521
MARISHA: Should we trade places so that some of us
are sitting next to them--

1736
02:02:56,521 --> 02:02:59,937
LIAM: We're not us, aren't we just spectator?

1737
02:02:59,937 --> 02:03:01,075
TALIESIN: We're just spectators.

1738
02:03:01,075 --> 02:03:02,027
MATT: You guys are spectating for this.

1739
02:03:02,027 --> 02:03:03,586
MARISHA: But I didn't know if we wanted to help
them.

1740
02:03:03,586 --> 02:03:07,768
TALIESIN: Phone a friend.

1741
02:03:11,478 --> 02:03:18,254
MATT: All right. So. Let's go ahead and begin, and
I'm going to preface this, letting you guys know

1742
02:03:18,446 --> 02:03:24,220
that I have nothing prepared. This is an entirely
improvised session. I'm curious to see where it

1743
02:03:24,220 --> 02:03:27,420
goes. This is a perfect example of
flying-by-the-seat-of-your-pants

1744
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:28,383
dungeon mastering.

1745
02:03:28,383 --> 02:03:30,204
LIAM: (whispers) It's going just like how you
rehearsed.

1746
02:03:30,204 --> 02:03:32,463
ORION: Whose line is it anyway, Matt?

1747
02:03:32,463 --> 02:03:38,827
MATT: This is a prop-based skit. Carrot Top's
Dungeons and Dragons, ladies and gentlemen.

1748
02:03:38,827 --> 02:03:39,905
LIAM: Oh god.

1749
02:03:39,905 --> 02:03:45,297
MATT: I know. All right, so, Dan, we saw your
wonderful character, your sailor dwarf.

1750
02:03:45,297 --> 02:03:46,670
DAN: Salty Pete.

1751
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:47,745
MATT: Yes, correct.

1752
02:03:47,745 --> 02:03:48,810
MARISHA: Salty Pete.

1753
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:49,648
MATT: Zac?

1754
02:03:49,648 --> 02:03:51,612
ZAC: I'm gonna let him go first, actually.

1755
02:03:51,612 --> 02:03:53,229
MATT: Ify, what you got?

1756
02:03:53,229 --> 02:03:59,668
IFY: Yo, this is Ulfgar Fireforge, I'm a
sellsword, ex-pit fighter, I'm slow to trust and

1757
02:03:59,668 --> 02:04:07,601
quick to kill. Money talks, bullshit walks. Just
so y'all know, I'm in it for the money and I play

1758
02:04:07,601 --> 02:04:12,939
a mean flute. It's sharpened at the end, so if you
get too close I might stab you in the neck. But

1759
02:04:12,939 --> 02:04:20,615
just know I'll do anything for a buck. Anything.

1760
02:04:21,192 --> 02:04:22,021
DAN: Anything.

1761
02:04:22,021 --> 02:04:24,316
IFY: Anything.

1762
02:04:24,861 --> 02:04:26,160
MATT: What was your guy's name again?

1763
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:27,093
LIAM: I can't wait for Zac's monologue.

1764
02:04:27,093 --> 02:04:28,231
DAN: Salty Pete.

1765
02:04:28,231 --> 02:04:36,111
ZAC: I am the great Snugglelord. A charismatic
charlatan from, as a warlock tiefling individual,

1766
02:04:36,111 --> 02:04:42,171
hailing from the land of Sippletint. I became
bored with my homeland after impregnating all of

1767
02:04:42,171 --> 02:04:48,162
the impregnable and decided to pledge my loyalty
to the overlord of a faraway land and set off to

1768
02:04:48,162 --> 02:04:54,580
do his evil bidding. I'm not really evil, though,
the overlord himself asked me to do a lot of very

1769
02:04:54,580 --> 02:05:01,035
evil things. At least, that's what the voices tell
me. Along the way, I learned that I was more of a

1770
02:05:01,035 --> 02:05:09,285
lover, not a fighter. So I lied to these two
assholes about the pleasures that await them at

1771
02:05:09,285 --> 02:05:17,013
the Overlord's chat room. They're dumdums and fell
for it, and now act as my personal bodyguards.

1772
02:05:17,013 --> 02:05:23,557
Basically, in short, I convince everyone with
intimidation and my great charisma, but I'm very

1773
02:05:23,557 --> 02:05:25,792
broken and weak physically on the inside.

1774
02:05:25,792 --> 02:05:30,943
(laughter)

1775
02:05:30,943 --> 02:05:39,376
ZAC: Actually, I'm hearing some voices from
Overlord right now. I believe we're at 3,162

1776
02:05:39,376 --> 02:05:49,021
subscribers, and the chat, I told you the chat
room was real. And if the chat room could respond

1777
02:05:49,021 --> 02:05:51,053
with the keyword 'Snugglelord'--

1778
02:05:51,053 --> 02:05:53,466
CREW: It's not working.

1779
02:05:53,466 --> 02:05:57,369
ZAC: I heard from one of Overlord's minions that
the giveaway is not working.

1780
02:05:57,369 --> 02:06:00,217
LIAM: (creepy voice) The giveaway is not working.

1781
02:06:00,217 --> 02:06:04,135
ZAC: And there's nothing that he can do about it
in his current situation. So we're going to ask

1782
02:06:04,135 --> 02:06:11,881
that the great fellow lad Nightbot pull the winner
for us for the giveaway.

1783
02:06:11,881 --> 02:06:17,386
IFY: I don't know what the hell this dude's
talking about, but he paid me, so.

1784
02:06:17,386 --> 02:06:25,527
ZAC: I brought a lot of money. Lot of money with
me on this trip. That's all.

1785
02:06:25,527 --> 02:06:31,817
MATT: Great. So you promised them, what awaits
them at the Snugglelord's, or the Overlord's--

1786
02:06:31,817 --> 02:06:34,931
ZAC: Basically the seven virgins of the chatroom.

1787
02:06:34,931 --> 02:06:40,878
MATT: Okay. Got you. All right. And so we'll,
okay, all right. So. Here's how we'll start.

1788
02:06:40,878 --> 02:06:44,883
LIAM: The gears are turning.

1789
02:06:44,883 --> 02:06:52,485
MATT: Upon your chance meeting one evening in a
darkened, drunken tavern in a darkened, drunken

1790
02:06:52,485 --> 02:06:58,518
state, upon spinning tales of your backgrounds,
your ears perked up at the promise of not only

1791
02:06:58,518 --> 02:07:06,654
great riches, but great soulful, gratifying
angelic entities promised to you from the realm

1792
02:07:06,654 --> 02:07:14,899
beyond, this Overlord, this Overlord that keeps a
very, very carefully hidden temple of worship not

1793
02:07:14,899 --> 02:07:19,683
too far from this city, no more than two and a
half days' travel on horseback. You mention to

1794
02:07:19,683 --> 02:07:24,907
them that there is a place, a grand place where
this temple could be found, and deep within

1795
02:07:24,907 --> 02:07:32,555
resided the secret of contacting and being taken
into the riches, the eternal vault of what is the

1796
02:07:32,555 --> 02:07:38,283
Overlord. Upon this agreement, a small bit of
change was exchanged, you managed to finagle the

1797
02:07:38,283 --> 02:07:48,121
local stable out of a couple horses and found your
way traveling before daybreak. You ride and ride

1798
02:07:48,121 --> 02:07:53,370
and ride for the next two days. An awkward series
of camping circumstances allow you to find you

1799
02:07:53,370 --> 02:07:57,811
don't have a lot in common based on conversation,
other than the love of money, and the love of this

1800
02:07:57,811 --> 02:08:03,344
promise they give you. And the further you travel,
the more and more the baneful eye of mistrust

1801
02:08:03,344 --> 02:08:09,566
begins to fall upon one Snugglelord. As the beads
of sweat drip down your face, but you know the

1802
02:08:09,566 --> 02:08:15,813
city is mounting soon, there will be a time where
you can prove to them that, in some way, shape, or

1803
02:08:15,813 --> 02:08:19,751
form, they have helped you find what it is you're seeking and
you can possibly kill them before they have the

1804
02:08:19,795 --> 02:08:26,304
chance to take you out. Nevertheless. As the
second sunrise hits, you crest over the last of a

1805
02:08:26,304 --> 02:08:30,861
large, hilly landscape, the high grass brushing
past your boots as you push through these

1806
02:08:30,861 --> 02:08:37,285
grasslands, and you see upon the fabled city of
Rockmarr. Rockmarr, not really that fabled, it's a

1807
02:08:37,285 --> 02:08:40,798
small farming village, he seems to be talking it
up as this grand city. So there's a moment of

1808
02:08:40,798 --> 02:08:46,718
disappointment as you look over and see what may
be anywhere from 60 to 70 houses to hovels to a

1809
02:08:46,718 --> 02:08:52,688
slightly dilapidated farmland. Bit of confusion
hits you and you look over to Snugglelord as he

1810
02:08:52,688 --> 02:08:54,463
puts his hands up.

1811
02:08:54,463 --> 02:09:01,012
ZAC: Yeah, it was-- the voices-- I mistranslate
them sometimes.

1812
02:09:01,012 --> 02:09:04,639
DAN: You mistranslate. It's 60 fucking hovels!

1813
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:07,121
ZAC: 600, 60, like one--

1814
02:09:07,121 --> 02:09:08,564
DAN: You dropped the zero.

1815
02:09:08,564 --> 02:09:10,623
ZAC: Well. It's an accident.

1816
02:09:10,623 --> 02:09:11,710
DAN: Great.

1817
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:15,471
ZAC: It won't happen again. Look, you're a great
dude, I like you, dude, I get along, you're great,

1818
02:09:15,471 --> 02:09:16,327
you're great.

1819
02:09:16,327 --> 02:09:18,501
DAN: Hands off the keg. You'll smudge it.

1820
02:09:18,501 --> 02:09:22,208
ZAC: You got my back, though.

1821
02:09:22,208 --> 02:09:28,373
IFY: You pay me? I'll kill him right now. Hey, you
pay me right now, he's dead.

1822
02:09:28,373 --> 02:09:30,086
DAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1823
02:09:30,086 --> 02:09:35,431
IFY: I'll kill you right now, I told you. You pay
me more, I'll kill him. I'll kill anybody for some

1824
02:09:35,431 --> 02:09:36,779
money.

1825
02:09:36,779 --> 02:09:38,757
DAN: I'll put in my pink slip, this is a bit I'm
willing to take.

1826
02:09:38,757 --> 02:09:40,233
IFY: Yo, how much money you got right there?

1827
02:09:40,233 --> 02:09:42,760
DAN: Let's find this Overlord's stash.

1828
02:09:42,806 --> 02:09:47,000
ZAC: Did I really have to pick the two dumbest
assholes to be in my group? I mean, really.

1829
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:54,148
DAN: I'm getting so tired of this outer monologue.
Let's find this, it's gotta be one of these 60

1830
02:09:54,148 --> 02:09:55,794
hovels, let's find it.

1831
02:09:55,794 --> 02:09:57,161
IFY: All right, let's do it.

1832
02:09:57,161 --> 02:09:58,482
ZAC: What are we looking for again?

1833
02:09:58,482 --> 02:10:05,165
DAN: You're the one who's supposed to know! We're
looking for your mythical chat room, whatever that

1834
02:10:05,165 --> 02:10:11,043
means. As far as I know, it said something about
virgins, about riches, about ladies--

1835
02:10:11,043 --> 02:10:12,606
IFY: See, that's all I care about.

1836
02:10:12,606 --> 02:10:17,285
DAN: Right, I'm looking for Helen. Who's a ship.
It's more of a metaphorical lady. But I'll take

1837
02:10:17,285 --> 02:10:18,691
any port in a storm.

1838
02:10:18,691 --> 02:10:21,336
(laughter)

1839
02:10:21,336 --> 02:10:24,312
IFY: You give me that boat, I'll kill him right
now.

1840
02:10:24,312 --> 02:10:25,268
(laughter)

1841
02:10:25,268 --> 02:10:27,545
IFY: You give me that boat, I'll kill him right
now.

1842
02:10:27,545 --> 02:10:28,664
DAN: Oh, we'll talk.

1843
02:10:28,664 --> 02:10:31,539
IFY: All right. I like boats, man. Shit.

1844
02:10:31,539 --> 02:10:38,560
MATT: As the tides of your relationships quickly
seem to turn, as you head towards the town, you

1845
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:48,045
notice-- and you've traveled here once before and
(laughs) while you understand that secretly,

1846
02:10:48,045 --> 02:10:55,486
beneath where this hidden chat room is, is a cache
of money that your previous employer hid amongst

1847
02:10:55,486 --> 02:10:59,459
other riches, and probably murdered most of your
allies before you managed to escape from his

1848
02:10:59,459 --> 02:11:05,847
clutches, and probably the only person of your
band of roving thieves and miscreants to not fall

1849
02:11:05,950 --> 02:11:10,708
to the Shadowed Blade, you know that his riches
are held there, you know that there are a number

1850
02:11:10,708 --> 02:11:18,464
of traps set within this dark underpassing, and
you know that once you can just get there, safely,

1851
02:11:18,464 --> 02:11:26,278
you can probably make it out alone. So just hold
tight to your position and you should be fine. As

1852
02:11:26,278 --> 02:11:32,305
you ride up to the outskirts of town, you can't
help but notice that, strangely, what was once a

1853
02:11:32,305 --> 02:11:39,940
bustling farming town seems fairly empty. The
nearby grass seems to have turned from a brightish

1854
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:48,818
healthy green to a dull, crackled brown-grey. The
farms themselves, the lands have turned dark and

1855
02:11:48,818 --> 02:11:54,948
cracked. The landscape appears to have been
untended-to for many a month, and aside from a

1856
02:11:54,948 --> 02:12:01,453
couple of scratching sounds and a distant cawing
of crows overhead as they flutter off into the

1857
02:12:01,453 --> 02:12:06,015
distance, there doesn't seem to be much of a sign
of life in this village.

1858
02:12:06,015 --> 02:12:07,751
LIAM: (whispers) Psst, the music changed.

1859
02:12:07,751 --> 02:12:08,845
ZAC: (whispers) I heard it.

1860
02:12:08,845 --> 02:12:09,638
LIAM: (whispers) Be careful.

1861
02:12:09,638 --> 02:12:10,435
ZAC: (whispers) Yeah.

1862
02:12:10,435 --> 02:12:11,824
MARISHA: (whispers) It's a clue.

1863
02:12:11,824 --> 02:12:15,916
MATT: As you begin to step into the village
proper, there is a small thoroughfare that leads

1864
02:12:15,916 --> 02:12:20,270
from the main area towards the center part of
town. As you ride in slowly, the clomping of your

1865
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:26,669
horses hitting against the rock, and dried dirt
beneath your feet, you catch what looks to be a

1866
02:12:26,669 --> 02:12:32,572
handful of individuals gathered towards the center
of town. Maybe no more than 150 feet away, you see

1867
02:12:32,572 --> 02:12:40,407
four figures, all different heights, dressed in
ragged rags and clothes that seem to have been met

1868
02:12:40,407 --> 02:12:48,226
with some sort of hardship and long, long nights
without any sort of cleaning agent. They gather

1869
02:12:48,226 --> 02:12:52,934
around in a circle over what looks to be a well.

1870
02:12:52,934 --> 02:12:57,567
DAN: Hello, there! What are you looking at in that
there well?

1871
02:12:57,567 --> 02:13:01,203
MATT: As soon as you say that loudly, the heads
suddenly spin to you.

1872
02:13:01,203 --> 02:13:02,256
DAN: Creepy.

1873
02:13:02,256 --> 02:13:06,470
MATT: Look amongst themselves. And they all begin
to scatter away from the well.

1874
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:10,600
ZAC: Can I make-- can I give him some money to go
check and see what's in that well?

1875
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:11,392
MATT: Okay.

1876
02:13:11,392 --> 02:13:13,850
IFY: You can give me money to do anything.

1877
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:16,157
ZAC: Here's some shillings, there, dude.

1878
02:13:16,157 --> 02:13:18,980
DAN: It's a local currency!

1879
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:25,006
IFY: Okay, man, you just wasted your money,
'cause I was just going to check to see if there's

1880
02:13:25,151 --> 02:13:28,901
money in this well anyway, so. A little more would
be go, though.

1881
02:13:28,901 --> 02:13:29,968
DAN: For wishes.

1882
02:13:29,968 --> 02:13:32,050
IFY: I'm gonna look down and see what's in here
right now.

1883
02:13:32,050 --> 02:13:35,469
MATT: So, as you approach, the figures have
scattered off into what looks like two different

1884
02:13:35,469 --> 02:13:40,661
alleyways on the opposite side of this small
thoroughfare, you glance over the edge, and the

1885
02:13:40,661 --> 02:13:45,821
first thing that catches you is this very, very
acidic smell, this pungence that hits your

1886
02:13:45,821 --> 02:13:55,227
nostrils, it's like long-long-rotting citrus
combined with almost an iron-like scent. You

1887
02:13:55,227 --> 02:14:00,203
glance over, and currently you can only see a few
feet into the darkened well, and it's too dark for

1888
02:14:00,203 --> 02:14:04,862
you to see anything beneath. However, you are, as
you are a dwarf, you have dark vision, and in the

1889
02:14:04,862 --> 02:14:10,133
low-light circumstance from the noonday sun, you
are able to look down and see that the brackish

1890
02:14:10,133 --> 02:14:15,167
liquid, what would be a normal watery well,
instead is very thick and viscous in the way it

1891
02:14:15,167 --> 02:14:22,997
slowly moves. And from what you can gather, the
water is disturbed. Recently has been disturbed.

1892
02:14:22,997 --> 02:14:28,713
IFY: Huh, that's good. Are there any shiny
trinkets there, like there might be some coins in

1893
02:14:28,713 --> 02:14:30,260
the bottom?

1894
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:32,599
DAN: Anything glittering through the thickness?

1895
02:14:32,599 --> 02:14:34,487
MATT: Make a perception check.

1896
02:14:34,487 --> 02:14:36,994
ZAC: I think there might be coins in there if you
want to jump in and see what's at the bottom!

1897
02:14:36,994 --> 02:14:39,291
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d20, add your
perception skill.

1898
02:14:39,291 --> 02:14:45,680
IFY: So, my perception, get plus two. 19.

1899
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:46,865
MATT: 19.

1900
02:14:46,865 --> 02:14:47,870
IFY: Nice.

1901
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:51,719
MATT: You take a moment and you curl your fingers
along the outside of the stone well. You place

1902
02:14:51,793 --> 02:14:57,504
your head down, and while the scent is not
pleasant, the need for gold is stronger. And what

1903
02:14:57,504 --> 02:15:01,767
little bit of light trickles through, you can see
what looks to be a semblance of a step or

1904
02:15:01,767 --> 02:15:07,411
something within the well that catches your eye,
and indeed you see a handful of gold coins. You're

1905
02:15:07,411 --> 02:15:12,487
not sure how long they've been there, tossed in
either as a wishing well or something more, but

1906
02:15:12,487 --> 02:15:15,975
there are apparently some coins within the
liquid.

1907
02:15:15,975 --> 02:15:19,990
IFY: All right. I learned a few years ago you just
can't stick your hand in any kind of water, you

1908
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:26,632
know. Your hand might get bitten up. Maybe I might
throw a piece of rope in there, see if it

1909
02:15:26,632 --> 02:15:33,368
disintegrates. If not, that gold's mine, I saw it
first. You will die if you touch it.

1910
02:15:33,368 --> 02:15:38,599
DAN: Ah, the old rope test. Classic. Nature's
litmus.

1911
02:15:38,599 --> 02:15:44,026
IFY: My man Sam over here knows about that rope
test. Yeah, I'll throw a rope in there.

1912
02:15:44,026 --> 02:15:45,753
ZAC: Who's Sam?

1913
02:15:45,753 --> 02:15:47,668
IFY: My man Money Sam over there.

1914
02:15:47,668 --> 02:15:50,178
DAN: It's Salty Pete, but Sam's me nickname.

1915
02:15:50,178 --> 02:15:53,814
(laughter)

1916
02:15:53,814 --> 02:16:00,672
MATT: So, as you go through your pouch, you pull
out a small wrapping of hemp rope, begin to lower

1917
02:16:00,672 --> 02:16:06,172
it into the liquid. As it hits the surface,
there's no hissing sound or immediate reaction. It

1918
02:16:06,172 --> 02:16:10,179
seems, you just kinda lower the rope a few feet
in, let it sit for a second, and as you pull it

1919
02:16:10,179 --> 02:16:16,696
up, you notice the rope itself has a very black
color to it, and as you pull it up, you can see

1920
02:16:16,696 --> 02:16:22,575
there is a very, very slight dissolving reaction
on the rope itself.

1921
02:16:22,575 --> 02:16:25,590
IFY: Can't get my money.

1922
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:30,208
ZAC: You might be able to jump in, get a handful,
and we'll pull you up and

1923
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:32,713
you could survive that, maybe.

1924
02:16:32,713 --> 02:16:35,177
DAN: I mean, it's hemp rope, your hand is
stronger.

1925
02:16:35,177 --> 02:16:37,020
ZAC: Yeah, I mean, you're a big dude.

1926
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:40,117
IFY: See, usually when two people are trying to
convince me to do something and they're not trying

1927
02:16:40,117 --> 02:16:46,713
to do it, that means I shouldn't do it. So. We're
gonna sit here and we're gonna talk about this

1928
02:16:46,713 --> 02:16:50,726
water, how we're gonna get inside it and get that
money.

1929
02:16:50,726 --> 02:16:56,099
ZAC: All right. Well, you're the seafarer, what
water, what do you do with that?

1930
02:16:56,099 --> 02:17:01,391
DAN: I know a brackish liquid when I see it. This
is nothing I've seen before, not molasses, not

1931
02:17:01,391 --> 02:17:07,909
swamp water, this is nothing the like I've seen
before. But I never back down from a challenge. I

1932
02:17:07,909 --> 02:17:10,241
thrust my hand in to grab the coins.

1933
02:17:10,241 --> 02:17:16,407
MATT: All right. They're about seven or so feet
below from the top of the well.

1934
02:17:16,407 --> 02:17:17,305
DAN: Oh, shit.

1935
02:17:17,305 --> 02:17:21,885
MATT: So as a dwarf, you're on your knees like
(grunts).

1936
02:17:21,885 --> 02:17:23,822
ZAC: You need a little help there, buddy?

1937
02:17:23,822 --> 02:17:26,813
DAN: It's all right, I'm highly acrobatic.

1938
02:17:26,813 --> 02:17:31,771
IFY: Yo, man, you better find my money, man, you
got me excited thinking you were about to grab

1939
02:17:31,771 --> 02:17:34,317
that money. You got nowhere near my money!

1940
02:17:34,317 --> 02:17:37,794
DAN: I forgot me stumpy arms.

1941
02:17:37,794 --> 02:17:41,019
MATT: With the aid of someone else, you could
probably get in there if you want--

1942
02:17:41,019 --> 02:17:42,864
DAN: Would you be so kind as to dangle me?

1943
02:17:42,864 --> 02:17:44,970
IFY: Oh yeah, you know I'll dangle you.

1944
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:47,326
DAN: It's a dwarf thing.

1945
02:17:47,326 --> 02:17:52,987
MATT: So (laughs) as Ulfgar grabs you by the
ankles and slams you over the front of the well,

1946
02:17:52,987 --> 02:18:01,383
you dangle down, your fingers just reaching in
towards the liquid. You grab at the coins. It's

1947
02:18:01,383 --> 02:18:07,350
very, very cold, the liquid, but it warms quickly
as a strange tingling sensation begins to rapidly

1948
02:18:07,350 --> 02:18:12,791
encase your hand as the feeling begins to go numb.
Your hand gathers a handful of coin, and I want

1949
02:18:12,791 --> 02:18:14,951
you to go ahead and make an athletics check.

1950
02:18:14,951 --> 02:18:16,274
IFY: All right.

1951
02:18:16,274 --> 02:18:19,254
DAN: Don't fuck this up.

1952
02:18:19,254 --> 02:18:21,669
IFY: It hit the pencil.

1953
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:24,015
DAN: He fucked it up.

1954
02:18:24,015 --> 02:18:27,338
IFY: The pencil messed it up. 14.

1955
02:18:27,338 --> 02:18:32,834
MATT: 14, okay. So you feel the sweat beginning to
pour down the side of your head, your muscles are

1956
02:18:32,887 --> 02:18:36,351
tense, but as soon as you see that gold vanish
from beneath the liquid, you know it's in the

1957
02:18:36,351 --> 02:18:40,138
proper hands, you pull him up out of the well
without much issue. You come up to the surface,

1958
02:18:40,138 --> 02:18:44,641
hand clutching the gold, and as you open your
fingers you look and see, indeed, the coins are as

1959
02:18:44,641 --> 02:18:50,831
clean as the day they were, almost like just being
in that well took any sort of tarnishing material

1960
02:18:50,831 --> 02:18:54,601
off of the coin itself. Also looking down, you
notice that your hand has gone

1961
02:18:54,601 --> 02:18:56,333
from numb to burning.

1962
02:18:56,333 --> 02:18:57,514
DAN: Oh no!

1963
02:18:57,514 --> 02:19:02,971
IFY: Get my money first! I take the money out of
his hand and put it in my sack. He's on the

1964
02:19:02,971 --> 02:19:07,596
ground. Throw some dirt on him! I throw some dirt
on your hand.

1965
02:19:07,596 --> 02:19:13,426
MATT: You take two points of acid damage as the
corrosive liquid eventually subsides the horrible

1966
02:19:13,426 --> 02:19:16,447
corroding of your hand, but not without its
impact.

1967
02:19:16,447 --> 02:19:22,544
IFY: Thank you for helping me out. I throw you a
gold piece.

1968
02:19:22,544 --> 02:19:23,907
DAN: Oh, thanks for the tip.

1969
02:19:23,907 --> 02:19:25,050
IFY: Yeah, you know.

1970
02:19:25,050 --> 02:19:30,465
ZAC: I'm sitting on my horse laughing my ass off.
This is hilarious. I'm just so glad now that I

1971
02:19:30,465 --> 02:19:34,226
teamed up with these dumdums because this is gonna
provide me with so much entertainment on my trip.

1972
02:19:34,226 --> 02:19:37,450
IFY: You know we can hear you, right? You say it
out loud, we know what you're saying.

1973
02:19:37,450 --> 02:19:40,320
DAN: We speak Common.

1974
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:41,981
(laughter)

1975
02:19:41,981 --> 02:19:50,596
IFY: What would it take to pick up the Snugglelord
and dip his head, just the tip of his head--

1976
02:19:50,596 --> 02:19:53,169
DAN: Oh, what about the gold piece you just gave
me?

1977
02:19:53,169 --> 02:19:57,993
IFY: Yeah, just dip his head in, just a little
bit.

1978
02:19:57,993 --> 02:20:03,383
DAN: Listen, I want to find this chat room. Let's
find where those scampering scabs got off to.

1979
02:20:03,383 --> 02:20:07,037
IFY: All right. But after this, I'm dipping your
head in the juice, man.

1980
02:20:07,037 --> 02:20:12,493
MATT: All right, so. Glancing over, I want all
three of you to go ahead and

1981
02:20:12,493 --> 02:20:14,543
make a perception check.

1982
02:20:14,543 --> 02:20:16,005
ZAC: Okay, so what do I roll?

1983
02:20:16,005 --> 02:20:20,366
MATT: Roll a d20, which is the most round of the
dice, and add your perception skill to the number

1984
02:20:20,366 --> 02:20:21,838
you roll.

1985
02:20:21,838 --> 02:20:23,603
DAN: 14.

1986
02:20:23,603 --> 02:20:24,643
IFY: 15.

1987
02:20:24,643 --> 02:20:25,636
ZAC: 16.

1988
02:20:25,636 --> 02:20:26,865
DAN: We are not clever.

1989
02:20:26,865 --> 02:20:33,386
MATT: 14, 15, and 16. All right, so. You, being at
sea for a long time, the salty air seems to have

1990
02:20:33,386 --> 02:20:36,882
taken its toll and your eyes are still a bit
fuzzy. As you take to rubbing them to try and get

1991
02:20:36,882 --> 02:20:41,470
a proper view, the two of you immediately see
that, in one of the nearby buildings, a door is

1992
02:20:41,470 --> 02:20:46,476
slightly ajar, and the moment that your heads turn
toward it, the door shuts almost reactively.

1993
02:20:46,476 --> 02:20:49,192
ZAC: Weird.

1994
02:20:49,192 --> 02:20:51,685
IFY: I say we go check that out.

1995
02:20:51,685 --> 02:20:53,296
DAN: Did you see something?

1996
02:20:53,296 --> 02:20:56,322
IFY: Yeah, yeah, a door shut. It smelled like
money.

1997
02:20:56,322 --> 02:20:59,228
DAN: Oh, great. Let's find it.

1998
02:20:59,228 --> 02:21:03,347
MATT: As you approach the door, you go ahead and
reach for the knob. As you give it a turn and a

1999
02:21:03,347 --> 02:21:08,992
tense push, the door is not opening. It looks like
the knob itself is either locked or being held,

2000
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:11,299
and the door is held in place.

2001
02:21:11,299 --> 02:21:14,859
IFY: Well, it looks like somebody might be trapped
in, let's bust down this door, man!

2002
02:21:14,859 --> 02:21:16,213
DAN: I can pick the lock.

2003
02:21:16,213 --> 02:21:17,244
IFY: All right.

2004
02:21:17,244 --> 02:21:20,290
DAN: Your choice. Don't want to take this
experience from you.

2005
02:21:20,290 --> 02:21:22,833
IFY: I think I'm gonna try to bust down this door
first.

2006
02:21:22,833 --> 02:21:25,694
DAN: Have at it. Leading with your shoulder.

2007
02:21:25,694 --> 02:21:26,543
IFY: All right.

2008
02:21:26,543 --> 02:21:30,321
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check, so just
roll a d20 and add your strength modifier.

2009
02:21:33,341 --> 02:21:34,751
DAN: Did you pull something?

2010
02:21:34,751 --> 02:21:36,896
IFY: Eight.

2011
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:43,583
MATT: You get a nice running start. Foot goes
right into the door, and it solidly hits you and

2012
02:21:43,583 --> 02:21:46,389
sends you falling right back onto your ass, nearly
knocking the wind out of you.

2013
02:21:46,448 --> 02:21:50,127
IFY: (out of breath) No, go ahead and get that
lock first.

2014
02:21:50,127 --> 02:21:51,524
(laughter)

2015
02:21:51,524 --> 02:21:55,204
DAN: This must be a powerful door.

2016
02:21:55,204 --> 02:21:59,739
MATT: Strong, reinforced wood and iron.

2017
02:21:59,739 --> 02:22:05,214
DAN: All right. We'll let Mrs. Buttersworth and
the lefty try this one. I'm gonna take my thieves'

2018
02:22:05,214 --> 02:22:06,960
tools out and try to pick the lock.

2019
02:22:07,008 --> 02:22:10,275
MATT: All right, roll a d20 and add your dexterity
plus thieves' tools.

2020
02:22:10,275 --> 02:22:12,946
DAN: Okay. One.

2021
02:22:12,946 --> 02:22:18,832
(laughter)

2022
02:22:18,832 --> 02:22:20,516
MATT: As you stepped over--

2023
02:22:20,516 --> 02:22:22,551
MARISHA: This door is gonna be the worst boss in
the entire game.

2024
02:22:22,551 --> 02:22:30,256
MATT: Pushing your dwarven ally aside, you pull
back your sleeves, pull out your fine masterwork

2025
02:22:30,256 --> 02:22:36,582
thieves' tools, and jostle for a moment, and you
hear that wonderful sound, that click, which

2026
02:22:36,582 --> 02:22:40,093
displays the unlocking mechanism. As you pull
back, you realize that wasn't the mechanism, that

2027
02:22:40,137 --> 02:22:41,994
was the end of your lockpick breaking in the
lock.

2028
02:22:41,994 --> 02:22:43,460
DAN: Oh, Christ.

2029
02:22:43,460 --> 02:22:45,557
ZAC: How're you dumdums doing down there?

2030
02:22:45,557 --> 02:22:49,519
DAN: Uh. Great. It's a powerful portal.

2031
02:22:49,519 --> 02:22:52,574
IFY: Oh man.

2032
02:22:52,574 --> 02:22:56,902
DAN: I dinnae think it can be traversed. We should
go around to the back, find a window.

2033
02:22:56,902 --> 02:23:04,818
IFY: Oh no, I'm gonna deal with this house real
quick. Let me just deal with this house.

2034
02:23:04,818 --> 02:23:08,129
DAN: Can I grant you a synergy bonus, whatever
that is?

2035
02:23:08,129 --> 02:23:12,628
IFY: I'm gonna see if there's something in my
dungeoneering pack that can

2036
02:23:12,628 --> 02:23:15,446
light this house on fire.

2037
02:23:15,446 --> 02:23:20,000
DAN: Classic. We'll smoke 'em out.

2038
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,439
ZAC: I actually think that's a really good idea.
Let's burn it.

2039
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:30,409
IFY: All right. I'll just check it out. Wait 'til
I look in my dungeoneer pack, see what's up here.

2040
02:23:30,409 --> 02:23:39,262
MATT: As he's looking through his pack, you,
Snugglelord, know that you as a fiend-pact

2041
02:23:39,262 --> 02:23:42,550
warlock, have the ability to use a cantrip called
Thaumaturgy.

2042
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:45,157
ZAC: That's what I was looking for.

2043
02:23:45,157 --> 02:23:49,343
MATT: That allows you do all kinds of slight
things, especially, you can create fire pretty

2044
02:23:49,343 --> 02:23:55,377
much within torchlight or a small handful of fire,
on command. So as he's looking through his pack--

2045
02:23:55,377 --> 02:24:00,242
ZAC: I'm gonna let him keep looking for a little
bit longer, because it humors me.

2046
02:24:00,242 --> 02:24:01,753
MATT: Fair enough.

2047
02:24:01,753 --> 02:24:04,229
ZAC: Did you find anything there, little buddy?

2048
02:24:04,229 --> 02:24:06,684
IFY: Yeah, I got a tinderbox in here. Uh.

2049
02:24:06,684 --> 02:24:16,619
ZAC: Before he can finish his sentence, I cast the
fire onto the house. I don't know.

2050
02:24:16,619 --> 02:24:20,018
DAN: Are you serious? You could do that all
along?

2051
02:24:20,018 --> 02:24:25,620
ZAC: All while sitting on my horse and smirking
smugly.

2052
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:30,746
MATT: With a flick of his wrist, a spark emerges
from his fingertips, and a burst of flame collides

2053
02:24:30,746 --> 02:24:38,946
with the upper echelon, the upper portion of the
rooftop. The thatched, dried-out roof begins to

2054
02:24:38,946 --> 02:24:45,948
immediately burn brighter and wider and wider
until about half the roof itself has caught flame.

2055
02:24:45,948 --> 02:24:50,779
Part of the wood surrounding the upper beams of
the front panel where is the door is, also begin

2056
02:24:50,779 --> 02:24:56,083
to catch, and you start hearing some subtle
coughing on the interior of the building.

2057
02:24:56,083 --> 02:24:57,092
DAN: Gotcha.

2058
02:24:57,092 --> 02:25:01,075
IFY: All right. Yeah, so now I'm gonna go punch
his horse in the face, and

2059
02:25:01,075 --> 02:25:02,989
then we'll wait by there.

2060
02:25:02,989 --> 02:25:04,533
DAN: Classic dwarven maneuver.

2061
02:25:04,533 --> 02:25:10,403
IFY: Right in the face as he laughs.

2062
02:25:10,403 --> 02:25:13,783
MATT: Roll a d20, add your attack bonus.

2063
02:25:13,783 --> 02:25:18,827
IFY: Goodness gracious.

2064
02:25:18,827 --> 02:25:20,574
MATT: Your strength and your proficiency.

2065
02:25:20,574 --> 02:25:24,299
IFY: That'll be 11.

2066
02:25:24,299 --> 02:25:29,109
MATT: 11. Horse is pretty easy to hit at that
point. Go ahead and roll a d4 and add your

2067
02:25:29,109 --> 02:25:30,471
strength modifier.

2068
02:25:30,471 --> 02:25:32,496
IFY: All right, d4.

2069
02:25:32,496 --> 02:25:36,032
DAN: Instantly decapitated.

2070
02:25:36,032 --> 02:25:38,697
IFY: Four plus, what is it, my strength?

2071
02:25:38,697 --> 02:25:39,938
MATT: Your strength modifier, yeah.

2072
02:25:39,938 --> 02:25:41,790
IFY: So that's seven.

2073
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:47,842
MATT: Seven. Wham! Socks your horse across the
face as you're laughing, mid-laugh, the laugh is

2074
02:25:47,842 --> 02:25:52,956
pulled from you as you go, "Hahaha-- whoa!" as
your horse falls immediately over onto his side--

2075
02:25:52,956 --> 02:25:53,919
ZAC: Son of a bitch bastard!

2076
02:25:53,919 --> 02:25:58,145
MATT: -- sending you tumbling from the horse, five
feet from it, on your side, face in the dirt,

2077
02:25:58,145 --> 02:26:03,442
coughing for a moment as your dwarven friend wipes
his hands. Ulfgar kind of chuckles over you.

2078
02:26:03,442 --> 02:26:05,223
MARISHA: That poor horse!

2079
02:26:05,223 --> 02:26:13,073
ZAC: Has the fire weakened the structure enough
for us to basically jump into the building?

2080
02:26:13,073 --> 02:26:15,289
DAN: Into the inferno?

2081
02:26:15,289 --> 02:26:19,508
ZAC: I have a fire resistance spell.

2082
02:26:19,508 --> 02:26:23,552
MATT: That's true. So looking at it, you can see
the flames are starting to get-- and you notice

2083
02:26:23,552 --> 02:26:30,155
the door is trying to be opened, but whatever lock
mechanism has been jammed.

2084
02:26:30,155 --> 02:26:33,236
DAN: Sorry! That's on me!

2085
02:26:33,281 --> 02:26:38,981
MATT: You hear (banging).

2086
02:26:38,981 --> 02:26:41,460
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure this is about to be
manslaughter.

2087
02:26:41,465 --> 02:26:43,267
MATT: From the opposite side of the door.

2088
02:26:43,267 --> 02:26:47,830
IFY: I go over to try and help this dude out,
because I still think I'm the hero in this.

2089
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:49,500
ZAC: Yeah, thanks for punching my horse,
dickhead!

2090
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:50,571
DAN: It's all about perspective.

2091
02:26:50,571 --> 02:26:51,791
ZAC: I had a plan!

2092
02:26:51,791 --> 02:26:54,332
DAN: Oh, you should've seen your face. He's gonna
punch me, oh it's my horse!

2093
02:26:54,332 --> 02:26:58,309
IFY: Yeah! Look at your horse, laying there like a
sack of--

2094
02:26:58,309 --> 02:27:00,617
ZAC: You punched a horse, what is wrong with you?

2095
02:27:00,617 --> 02:27:08,508
IFY: Nothing. Not a damn thing is wrong with me,
now let me help this dude out of this house that I

2096
02:27:08,508 --> 02:27:10,095
lit on fire--

2097
02:27:10,095 --> 02:27:12,204
ZAC: I lit on fire, you couldn't do shit!

2098
02:27:12,204 --> 02:27:14,443
IFY: Whatever, I'm gonna help him out this house
real quick.

2099
02:27:14,443 --> 02:27:15,990
DAN: It's a strong door.

2100
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:17,267
MATT: Make a strength check again.

2101
02:27:17,267 --> 02:27:20,367
LIAM: Oh, burn the people in their homes, classic
dwarf move.

2102
02:27:20,367 --> 02:27:22,967
IFY: Six.

2103
02:27:22,967 --> 02:27:26,089
(laughter)

2104
02:27:26,089 --> 02:27:32,025
MATT: As you go charging, headfirst this time,
towards the door to headbutt through, a second

2105
02:27:32,025 --> 02:27:37,544
time you land on your back. However, whatever the
impact, you managed to jostle free whatever part

2106
02:27:37,544 --> 02:27:41,565
of your lockpick was stuck in the door, which
suddenly swings open, smoke billows out into the

2107
02:27:41,565 --> 02:27:46,860
midday sun, and you see a cloaked individual,
probably about a little shorter than you in

2108
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:53,747
height, comes rushing out, coughing outward, just
trying to get a breath of fresh air.

2109
02:27:53,747 --> 02:27:55,754
DAN: I saved you.

2110
02:27:55,754 --> 02:28:01,946
IFY: Who set your house on fire, man? Ah, shit!
Yo, your house got set on fire, dude!

2111
02:28:01,946 --> 02:28:03,392
DAN: Is that door made of mithral?

2112
02:28:03,392 --> 02:28:08,385
ZAC: You look really weird, why couldn't you just
say hello, you looked weird, and we tried to get

2113
02:28:08,528 --> 02:28:10,437
in, we couldn't, you look weird.

2114
02:28:10,437 --> 02:28:12,239
MATT: Make a deception check.

2115
02:28:12,239 --> 02:28:13,540
MARISHA: Deception check?

2116
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:17,936
IFY: Oh, of course, now I do good. I rolled a 19.

2117
02:28:17,936 --> 02:28:23,856
MATT: A 19. Okay. The individual pulls back the
hood, and what you can see, it was a ragged gray,

2118
02:28:23,856 --> 02:28:30,009
essentially a cloak that was placed over with
them. You see their pants are kind of torn, and

2119
02:28:30,009 --> 02:28:37,599
when the face is revealed, it's an extremely
malnourished female halfling. She looks like she's

2120
02:28:37,599 --> 02:28:43,513
seen some rough, rough days, she could probably
pass for mid-twenties or so, but due to her

2121
02:28:43,513 --> 02:28:46,206
current state of health she looks much, much
older.

2122
02:28:46,206 --> 02:28:48,781
ZAC: I feel like a real dickhead.

2123
02:28:48,781 --> 02:28:55,564
MATT: She finishes coughing, she goes, "Thank you.
Thank you for saving me. I appreciate the assist."

2124
02:28:55,564 --> 02:28:59,848
ZAC: Well, to be fair, I mean, he did fall on his
ass twice. And he punched a horse.

2125
02:28:59,848 --> 02:29:02,761
IFY: Yeah, well, that horse was just collateral
damage.

2126
02:29:02,761 --> 02:29:04,900
DAN: This is pure conjecture and hearsay.

2127
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:08,100
IFY: The horse, actually, I'm gonna give you the
full story, the horse was blocking my way to help

2128
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:12,691
get you out of this house, this ugly-ass horse,
all in my way, anyway.

2129
02:29:12,691 --> 02:29:15,063
ZAC: Is there a way to convince her that I'm the
only person here she should trust?

2130
02:29:15,063 --> 02:29:16,731
MATT: Yeah, tell her.

2131
02:29:16,731 --> 02:29:21,330
ZAC: I'm like, look here, little girl, these guys
are idiots, you don't wanna talk to them, just

2132
02:29:21,330 --> 02:29:25,309
talk to me, like look me in the eyes, talk to me,
let's talk this through, like what's going on with

2133
02:29:25,309 --> 02:29:26,636
you, what's up with you--

2134
02:29:26,636 --> 02:29:28,396
IFY: Yeah, trust the guy who looks like Lord Hades
himself.

2135
02:29:28,396 --> 02:29:30,107
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

2136
02:29:30,107 --> 02:29:30,650
ZAC: What's that?

2137
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:31,431
MATT: Persuasion roll.

2138
02:29:31,431 --> 02:29:32,316
IFY: Look at this guy over here.

2139
02:29:32,316 --> 02:29:33,231
MATT: d20, add persuasion.

2140
02:29:33,231 --> 02:29:34,566
LIAM: C'mon, tiefling.

2141
02:29:34,566 --> 02:29:36,165
ZAC: Okay, now, how do I add these numbers
together?

2142
02:29:36,165 --> 02:29:37,156
IFY: What is it, persuasion?

2143
02:29:37,156 --> 02:29:38,102
DAN: Yeah, persuasion.

2144
02:29:38,102 --> 02:29:39,640
DAN and IFY: So plus four.

2145
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:40,529
LIAM: It's high, it's high.

2146
02:29:40,529 --> 02:29:41,436
DAN: So 21.

2147
02:29:41,436 --> 02:29:42,476
ZAC: 21.

2148
02:29:42,476 --> 02:29:46,897
MATT: Okay, she glances at the other two dwarves,
who are both kinda like, (growls), just general

2149
02:29:46,897 --> 02:29:53,119
stature and nature two rather ragged-looking
swarthy gentlemen. Looks to you with your

2150
02:29:53,119 --> 02:29:58,290
immediately dangerous-looking tiefling face, but
there's something about your voice and the way you

2151
02:29:58,290 --> 02:30:02,906
spoke to her that is strangely welcoming,
especially in the chaos of this house nearly

2152
02:30:02,906 --> 02:30:08,081
burning down around her. She reaches out and
touches your hand gently and goes, "Thank you.

2153
02:30:08,142 --> 02:30:13,885
"Certainly. We've been lost in this region for over
a month now. We're looking for food. We're not

2154
02:30:13,885 --> 02:30:17,481
"from here, but when we came to this village it was
empty. Everyone was gone. No bodies, no one

2155
02:30:17,481 --> 02:30:23,925
"killed, just missing. Just vanished. But it seems
the further we get from this place, there's

2156
02:30:23,925 --> 02:30:29,046
"something that draws us back to it. We get
thirsty. We get hungry. Like there's a curse to it

2157
02:30:29,046 --> 02:30:31,169
"that won't let us leave."

2158
02:30:31,169 --> 02:30:37,510
IFY: Oh, well, honey, that's just you, that was
the rapture from the lord Bahamut just raising up

2159
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:41,953
all his dragonling followers and all that such and
things.

2160
02:30:41,953 --> 02:30:44,748
ZAC: Again, he is not to be trusted, he is an
idiot.

2161
02:30:44,748 --> 02:30:49,758
DAN: Where are you drawn back to, specifically?

2162
02:30:49,758 --> 02:30:54,918
MATT: "It's hard to say, we're continuously
brought towards the center of this village.

2163
02:30:54,918 --> 02:31:02,235
"There's a large platform, where it looks like
there used to be more of a presentory stage where

2164
02:31:02,235 --> 02:31:08,056
"small events or at least the township would
discuss, but right now there's something that

2165
02:31:08,056 --> 02:31:12,028
"keeps calling us back to that place. We've set up
tents there to survive in the meantime. We don't

2166
02:31:12,028 --> 02:31:16,034
"trust the buildings about. I can show you."

2167
02:31:16,034 --> 02:31:20,209
ZAC: That would be great. I'll pretend to be your
friend until we get there.

2168
02:31:20,209 --> 02:31:21,763
DAN: Why would you say 'pretend'?

2169
02:31:21,763 --> 02:31:23,574
IFY: Why would you say that out loud?

2170
02:31:23,574 --> 02:31:27,003
DAN: Are you fucking serious? Show some
discretion.

2171
02:31:27,003 --> 02:31:30,182
ZAC: You really want a friend, don't you?

2172
02:31:30,182 --> 02:31:31,418
MATT: "I do."

2173
02:31:31,418 --> 02:31:33,875
DAN: How does this work every time?

2174
02:31:33,875 --> 02:31:39,227
IFY: I don't know, man, I think it's the demon
horns using demon powers and stuff, you know? I

2175
02:31:39,227 --> 02:31:42,451
need to go to church on Sunday.

2176
02:31:42,451 --> 02:31:45,349
MATT: "Follow me." And she turns around and kind
of puts her hood up and she darts down the

2177
02:31:45,349 --> 02:31:49,233
alleyway to the right of the burning building,
keeping away from the flames that are now

2178
02:31:49,233 --> 02:31:52,056
beginning to completely envelop the structure.

2179
02:31:52,056 --> 02:31:53,137
IFY: Oh, excuse me.

2180
02:31:53,137 --> 02:31:55,422
ZAC: Sorry about that, by the way. That was an
accident.

2181
02:31:55,422 --> 02:31:57,491
IFY: We don't know, yeah, who'd do that?

2182
02:31:57,491 --> 02:31:59,353
DAN: An accident by nature. Nature's accident.

2183
02:31:59,353 --> 02:32:00,738
IFY: Why do you keep bringing this up when nothing
happened, man?

2184
02:32:00,738 --> 02:32:02,564
DAN: Yeah, it just caught fire.

2185
02:32:02,564 --> 02:32:05,204
IFY: Anyway, do you have any gold in that house?
Is there any money in that house?

2186
02:32:05,204 --> 02:32:08,594
ZAC: We're moving on to bigger and better things,
don't worry about the house.

2187
02:32:08,594 --> 02:32:11,077
DAN: Yeah, take us to these tents, they sound
great.

2188
02:32:11,077 --> 02:32:14,065
IFY: If there's gold in the house, y'all can keep
walking, I'm gonna go get that hot gold, man.

2189
02:32:14,065 --> 02:32:15,892
ZAC: Keep your eye on the prize, man.

2190
02:32:15,892 --> 02:32:18,389
IFY: Yeah, we gotta look at this juice, anyway.
Tell her to take us to the juice.

2191
02:32:18,389 --> 02:32:21,038
ZAC: We're going to the tents.

2192
02:32:21,038 --> 02:32:22,453
IFY: Oh, all right.

2193
02:32:22,453 --> 02:32:27,436
DAN: Juice is a common dwarven term for tents.
It's slang.

2194
02:32:27,436 --> 02:32:30,981
MATT: As you keep walking along, she's darting
ahead, keeping an eye out, she turns around and

2195
02:32:30,981 --> 02:32:34,658
goes, "By the way, Lily."

2196
02:32:34,658 --> 02:32:37,035
ZAC: Oh, you have a name!

2197
02:32:37,035 --> 02:32:39,034
DAN: Or a favorite flower.

2198
02:32:39,034 --> 02:32:42,092
ZAC: One or the other. Name?

2199
02:32:42,092 --> 02:32:43,753
MATT: "That's my name."

2200
02:32:43,753 --> 02:32:51,179
IFY: So I'm Ulfgar, you know, I'm a sellsword
ex-pit fighter, put your money where your mouth

2201
02:32:51,179 --> 02:32:59,037
is, slow to trust, quick to kill. Money talks,
bullshit walks. (laughs) And I extend my hand out

2202
02:32:59,037 --> 02:33:02,326
for some dwarf dap.

2203
02:33:02,326 --> 02:33:05,277
MATT: She reaches out and pats the top.

2204
02:33:05,277 --> 02:33:10,034
DAN: Classic halfling. They always mess it up.

2205
02:33:10,034 --> 02:33:12,415
IFY: It's all good, it's all good.

2206
02:33:12,415 --> 02:33:15,189
DAN: I'm Salty Pete, but some call me Sam.

2207
02:33:15,189 --> 02:33:17,732
MATT: "All right, Sam."

2208
02:33:17,908 --> 02:33:19,579
DAN: You can call me Salty.

2209
02:33:19,579 --> 02:33:21,060
MATT: "Salty it is, all right."

2210
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:26,998
ZAC: I get the idea that you probably are without
a father figure. From the look in your-- you can

2211
02:33:26,998 --> 02:33:29,065
call me Dad if you want.

2212
02:33:29,065 --> 02:33:31,580
IFY: Yo, you're getting creepy, man!

2213
02:33:31,580 --> 02:33:34,032
MATT: "We'll get home and meet my father."

2214
02:33:34,032 --> 02:33:36,717
ZAC: Oh, that's, I'm Snugglelord, that's fine, I'm
sure he's a great guy.

2215
02:33:36,717 --> 02:33:38,761
DAN: Close one.

2216
02:33:38,761 --> 02:33:41,928
MATT: As she continues now with an awkward side
glance--

2217
02:33:41,928 --> 02:33:44,122
ZAC: I can't bear children, you know this!

2218
02:33:44,122 --> 02:33:46,068
DAN: So sorry.

2219
02:33:46,068 --> 02:33:49,677
ZAC: I got it all out. There's nothing left.

2220
02:33:49,677 --> 02:33:57,428
MATT: As the alley opens up into this central,
essentially a small square to this village, you

2221
02:33:57,428 --> 02:34:00,330
can see what she was talking about. There's an
elevated wood platform, although it's partially

2222
02:34:00,330 --> 02:34:03,222
collapsed in the center, it looks like either
something heavy was laid on top of it and it

2223
02:34:03,222 --> 02:34:07,795
eventually gave way, or something heavy smashed it
from up top. And around the outskirts of this, you

2224
02:34:07,795 --> 02:34:11,480
see what look to be about six or seven tents that
are kind of a very small ramshackle tent city.

2225
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:16,068
They appear to be made from scraps of cloth that
seem to have been salvaged from nearby houses or

2226
02:34:16,068 --> 02:34:25,129
storage facilities, but as you approach, she gives
out a voice and says, "Stoic! Serling, we have

2227
02:34:25,177 --> 02:34:29,832
"guests, please!" At which point one of the tents
opens up and you see what looks like an elderly

2228
02:34:29,832 --> 02:34:34,897
woman, human-ish from what you can see at this
distance. Looks out and goes, "Oh, is that right?

2229
02:34:34,897 --> 02:34:41,790
"Are they here to help?" And she says, "I think so,
I think so," and she rushes out and helps the old

2230
02:34:41,790 --> 02:34:43,202
woman out of her tent.

2231
02:34:43,364 --> 02:34:44,873
ZAC: Yes, yes, we're here to help.

2232
02:34:44,873 --> 02:34:49,207
MATT: At which point a secondary tent opens next
to that and a large burly halfling steps out,

2233
02:34:49,207 --> 02:34:59,021
older, looks to be the one temporarily in command
of this small group of people, steps out. "So

2234
02:34:59,021 --> 02:35:01,848
"you're here to help, you say."

2235
02:35:01,848 --> 02:35:03,396
ZAC: (high-pitched) Yeah.

2236
02:35:03,396 --> 02:35:05,646
DAN: Aye, messir. We're here to help.

2237
02:35:05,646 --> 02:35:07,344
IFY: Yeah, if you got the money to pay us--

2238
02:35:07,344 --> 02:35:08,456
ZAC: God.

2239
02:35:08,456 --> 02:35:14,638
IFY: Big money. Hey, so, I'm gonna let you know,
I'm a sellsword and ex-pit fighter, slow to trust,

2240
02:35:14,638 --> 02:35:20,333
quick to kill. Money talks, bullshit walks. Let's
kill somebody.

2241
02:35:20,333 --> 02:35:23,101
DAN: We've got to get you a fucking business
card.

2242
02:35:23,101 --> 02:35:27,556
LIAM: Love that dwarven dialect.

2243
02:35:27,556 --> 02:35:33,341
MATT: The gentleman kind of steps forward and
looks at the three of you--

2244
02:35:33,341 --> 02:35:36,054
DAN: Don't leave him hanging.

2245
02:35:36,054 --> 02:35:43,129
MATT: (laughs) He sort of just stares at you. As
you're waiting, the (laughs) the young halfling

2246
02:35:43,129 --> 02:35:47,475
girl, Lily, comes up and pats you on the hand
again, kind of alleviating the tension.

2247
02:35:47,475 --> 02:35:49,689
DAN: Oh, too slow.

2248
02:35:49,689 --> 02:35:56,360
MATT: The man takes a step forward. This time, you
can see definitely posturing a presence of

2249
02:35:56,360 --> 02:36:02,762
masculinity and control of the situation. Looks
about the three of you and goes, "All right. So if

2250
02:36:02,762 --> 02:36:06,690
"you're here to help, show me what weapons you've
got."

2251
02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:08,745
IFY: Oh, my favorite part.

2252
02:36:08,745 --> 02:36:15,942
DAN: Show me mine, I'll show you yours. Or
vice-versa. Sorry, the salt has addled my brain.

2253
02:36:15,942 --> 02:36:18,264
ZAC: Idiots.

2254
02:36:18,264 --> 02:36:26,598
IFY: All right, so I pull out my two longswords,
so, I got two longswords, I use 'em at the same

2255
02:36:26,598 --> 02:36:33,213
time. I like to call this one Regina and this one
Lindy, you get it, right, left, haha, I'm

2256
02:36:33,213 --> 02:36:38,948
hilarious. And then I got this crossbow right
here. I use it with one hand, it'll bust somebody

2257
02:36:38,948 --> 02:36:42,347
in the face. Any questions?

2258
02:36:42,347 --> 02:36:46,353
ZAC: No, I have no questions, that's very nice.

2259
02:36:46,353 --> 02:36:48,954
DAN: I didn't know their names, that's beautiful,
that's great.

2260
02:36:48,954 --> 02:36:50,874
IFY: Yeah yeah yeah.

2261
02:36:50,874 --> 02:36:53,255
ZAC: Just after right and left, no--

2262
02:36:53,255 --> 02:36:58,685
IFY: You know, I like making jokes up, it's good
to pass the time when you're

2263
02:36:58,685 --> 02:37:00,341
cleaning your weapons.

2264
02:37:00,341 --> 02:37:05,244
DAN: I've got several blades, a shortbow, and me
trusty cape, which can come in handy

2265
02:37:05,244 --> 02:37:07,696
in case of emergency.

2266
02:37:07,696 --> 02:37:14,427
ZAC: I merely have this little axe, it's no big
deal, it's not really a big deal, and a crossbow.

2267
02:37:14,427 --> 02:37:16,873
I'm not really that good in a fight.

2268
02:37:16,873 --> 02:37:18,638
MATT: "All right."

2269
02:37:18,638 --> 02:37:21,064
ZAC: These guys, though, they're great, you can
use them for whatever you want.

2270
02:37:21,064 --> 02:37:22,760
MATT: "And you're the leader."

2271
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:25,107
ZAC: Yes.

2272
02:37:25,107 --> 02:37:26,723
(laughter)

2273
02:37:26,723 --> 02:37:28,397
DAN: He's the employer.

2274
02:37:28,397 --> 02:37:29,571
MATT: "Right."

2275
02:37:29,571 --> 02:37:31,266
ZAC: Same difference.

2276
02:37:31,266 --> 02:37:37,159
MATT: "Here's what you need to know. We've been
stuck in this place for at least two weeks now.

2277
02:37:37,159 --> 02:37:46,513
"We're withering away out here, little to eat, no
aid's coming. Whatever darkness has taken root in

2278
02:37:46,577 --> 02:37:52,259
"this small town, I've come to believe, has
infiltrated the water, has infiltrated the ground

2279
02:37:52,259 --> 02:37:58,770
"beneath us, the very earth itself. As far as I can
tell, each night when we sleep, the dreams, the

2280
02:37:58,770 --> 02:38:06,301
"nightmares get worse. And worse. I daresay if this
continues for long, I'm liable to lose my own

2281
02:38:06,301 --> 02:38:14,770
"sanity, and I want to keep my daughter safe from
me. So. All the cash I have, not more than a

2282
02:38:14,770 --> 02:38:19,028
"simple 120 gold, will be to you to distribute as
you see fit."

2283
02:38:19,028 --> 02:38:21,332
(background noise)

2284
02:38:21,332 --> 02:38:25,106
MATT: "Turn that down."

2285
02:38:25,106 --> 02:38:27,639
MARISHA: I made it silent.

2286
02:38:27,639 --> 02:38:30,501
MATT: As the elderly woman goes, "I'm sorry," and
she puts her small violin away that she was

2287
02:38:30,501 --> 02:38:33,145
playing as her mind slips.

2288
02:38:33,145 --> 02:38:35,490
ZAC: I was really enjoying the music, it's quite
fine.

2289
02:38:35,490 --> 02:38:41,422
IFY: Yeah, you're speaking my language right now,
and I'm ready to do anything for you right now.

2290
02:38:41,422 --> 02:38:43,402
DAN: I'd say you're right about the water.

2291
02:38:43,402 --> 02:38:44,327
IFY: Yeah, yeah.

2292
02:38:44,327 --> 02:38:45,643
ZAC: Let's-- the water is strange.

2293
02:38:45,643 --> 02:38:49,197
IFY: First off, it's the juice, obviously. They're
drinking the juice, they ain't got no other kind

2294
02:38:49,197 --> 02:38:53,418
of water, the juice making you crazy. So we need
to go up there and maybe you can use some arcana

2295
02:38:53,618 --> 02:39:00,436
to look at that juice in there and see what's up
with it. And we could get this money.

2296
02:39:00,436 --> 02:39:05,158
DAN: I think we should check the area around the
stage and see if there's an opening or somewhere

2297
02:39:05,158 --> 02:39:07,027
that we could get beneath.

2298
02:39:07,027 --> 02:39:08,461
ZAC: Yeah, let's try that.

2299
02:39:08,461 --> 02:39:09,411
IFY: Yeah, but if you--

2300
02:39:09,411 --> 02:39:11,449
ZAC: I'm also a little concerned about your hand.

2301
02:39:11,449 --> 02:39:12,310
DAN: It's fine.

2302
02:39:12,310 --> 02:39:13,614
ZAC: You're not, you're not like--

2303
02:39:13,614 --> 02:39:16,320
DAN: Listen, I'm sorry I don't exfoliate like you
tieflings do.

2304
02:39:16,382 --> 02:39:20,346
ZAC: I'm just, you know, like no weird things
going on up there?

2305
02:39:20,346 --> 02:39:25,172
DAN: No, just the thought of getting my ship back
and my shit together.

2306
02:39:25,172 --> 02:39:26,892
ZAC: All right, all right, okay. No, we're cool,
we're cool.

2307
02:39:26,892 --> 02:39:30,766
IFY: No so, do you want your ship back or your
shit back, that accent funny as fuck.

2308
02:39:30,766 --> 02:39:32,732
(laughter)

2309
02:39:32,732 --> 02:39:35,195
DAN: Oh yeah. My accent. Dwarves, am I right?

2310
02:39:35,195 --> 02:39:38,943
IFY: You ever come up to the mountain with us
mountain dwarves.

2311
02:39:38,943 --> 02:39:41,948
DAN: We hillfolk are a different breed.

2312
02:39:41,948 --> 02:39:44,894
IFY: Yeah, yeah, man, this is the mountain
dwarves, we keep it real.

2313
02:39:44,894 --> 02:39:49,644
ZAC: I'm terribly sorry, I swear their muscle goes
a lot further than their brains do, though.

2314
02:39:49,644 --> 02:39:56,507
MATT: "Best be, for the coin I'm paying for this.
But we'll see. Prove your worth. Follow me." He

2315
02:39:56,507 --> 02:40:00,088
leads you over towards the central stage in the
middle of this open area. You can see now, the

2316
02:40:00,088 --> 02:40:06,417
stage-- Upon closer inspection, it hasn't
collapsed, it hasn't been smashed, it looks like

2317
02:40:06,417 --> 02:40:12,693
the central area beneath it has been pulled down,
there is an actual what looks almost like the top

2318
02:40:12,693 --> 02:40:17,382
of an anthill, like it's slowly sinking into what
appears to be some sort of a funnel that

2319
02:40:17,382 --> 02:40:21,436
disappears beneath the surface of the earth.

2320
02:40:21,436 --> 02:40:25,883
DAN: Well. That looks unsettling at best.

2321
02:40:25,883 --> 02:40:30,784
ZAC: A little scary. Just throw your other hand
down there and see what happens to it.

2322
02:40:30,784 --> 02:40:36,880
DAN: I'm gonna try a different tactic. I'd like to
gaze into the abyss with my Darkvision.

2323
02:40:37,034 --> 02:40:42,147
MATT: All right. So you have to step underneath
the large wooden platform, move through the broken

2324
02:40:42,147 --> 02:40:47,240
portion of it. You can see where elements of it
are jammed into this gravelly sand texture that

2325
02:40:47,240 --> 02:40:54,987
formulates this small funnel. It's roughly about
12 to 15 feet across, and part of it does spill

2326
02:40:54,987 --> 02:41:00,867
out into the opposite side of this open area. As
you glance towards the edge, you feel the sand

2327
02:41:00,867 --> 02:41:02,762
give a little bit under your foot.

2328
02:41:02,762 --> 02:41:03,822
DAN: Uh-oh.

2329
02:41:03,822 --> 02:41:07,196
MATT: Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Dexterity saving throw.

2330
02:41:07,196 --> 02:41:08,553
DAN: So that would just be--

2331
02:41:08,553 --> 02:41:09,850
MATT: Saving throw, which should be at the top.

2332
02:41:09,850 --> 02:41:12,449
DAN: Gotcha. A hot nine.

2333
02:41:12,449 --> 02:41:16,830
MATT: As you look over and step, you find the sand
begins to slip from underneath you. You reach up

2334
02:41:16,830 --> 02:41:20,995
to try and grab one of the wooden platforms to
keep yourself stable, however, your other foot

2335
02:41:20,995 --> 02:41:28,809
that you had your weight on also slips as the sand
and dirt seems to give out under you entirely. As

2336
02:41:28,809 --> 02:41:33,177
you hit your side, you feel it actually beginning
to cave inward and pull you deeper and deeper into

2337
02:41:33,177 --> 02:41:37,264
this small recess in the ground. You're now up to
your waist, being pulled underneath the surface.

2338
02:41:37,264 --> 02:41:38,844
You guys watch him being sucked in--

2339
02:41:38,844 --> 02:41:40,198
DAN: A little help!

2340
02:41:40,198 --> 02:41:41,996
ZAC: Grab him, grab him! Get in there, get in
there.

2341
02:41:41,996 --> 02:41:47,329
IFY: Damn! Oh my god! Damn! He's in there, that's
deep!

2342
02:41:47,329 --> 02:41:50,221
ZAC: Jump, just jump, I'll grab you--

2343
02:41:50,221 --> 02:41:55,255
IFY: How much are we gonna get paid for this? I'm
gonna jump inside, I'm gonna jump inside!

2344
02:41:55,255 --> 02:41:57,761
ZAC: I don't know, just jump!

2345
02:41:57,761 --> 02:41:59,758
IFY: I'm jumping inside, come on, follow me!

2346
02:41:59,758 --> 02:42:00,734
ZAC: All right!

2347
02:42:00,734 --> 02:42:04,236
MATT: As you leap, which at this point you're just
past your face and nose under the sand, you leap

2348
02:42:04,236 --> 02:42:10,816
onto and grabbing onto the sides of his head just
as it passes his eyes, as you grab it, you now

2349
02:42:10,816 --> 02:42:14,985
plant your feet to pull. What you're used to, you
know, when you get a nice firm foothold and pull,

2350
02:42:14,985 --> 02:42:19,150
there's no firm foothold. Your feet go into the
sand and you just continue going underneath with

2351
02:42:19,150 --> 02:42:24,170
him, until eventually you yourself are completely
submerged and disappear beneath the surface of

2352
02:42:24,170 --> 02:42:30,183
this, now leaving you alone, staring at this now
slowly stopping funnel of cascading sand.

2353
02:42:30,183 --> 02:42:32,290
MARISHA: Oh, shit! What you gonna do?

2354
02:42:32,290 --> 02:42:37,196
ZAC: Well. Fuck it, I'm going to jump in after
them. Oh, this is stupid! This is stupid stupid

2355
02:42:37,196 --> 02:42:39,787
stupid. Yeah, I'm gonna jump in after them.

2356
02:42:39,787 --> 02:42:45,748
MATT: All right. You run and you leap, and with an
impact sound, your tiefling self dips and

2357
02:42:45,748 --> 02:42:50,478
immediately disappears beneath the surface.
There's a few moments of very scary breathlessness

2358
02:42:50,478 --> 02:42:53,827
as all of a sudden suffocation hits each of you.
The darkness, you're unable to see, you're unable to

2359
02:42:53,827 --> 02:42:59,082
move and there's just this constraint of earth
pressing around you, and for a good five to ten

2360
02:42:59,252 --> 02:43:02,635
seconds you begin to come to terms with your
mortality as if this is your

2361
02:43:02,635 --> 02:43:04,581
final moment on this plane.

2362
02:43:04,581 --> 02:43:06,796
ZAC: Well, this sucks so far.

2363
02:43:06,796 --> 02:43:10,625
MATT: Then you feel this strange lightening
sensation in your feet, almost like the pressure's

2364
02:43:10,625 --> 02:43:15,773
beginning to alleviate, and with that, you now
fall. You're falling in darkness.

2365
02:43:15,773 --> 02:43:19,757
IFY and DAN: (yell)

2366
02:43:19,757 --> 02:43:23,343
DAN: God no, I'm gonna die without seeing my Helen
again! Oh no!

2367
02:43:23,343 --> 02:43:25,864
ZAC: I use my Darkvision to kind of see what's
below me.

2368
02:43:25,914 --> 02:43:27,684
IFY: Where's my money? Where's my money?

2369
02:43:27,684 --> 02:43:30,207
MATT: Unfortunately, there's no light source down
here at all, so you don't even have dim light to

2370
02:43:30,207 --> 02:43:34,440
work off of, it's pure darkness. However, I want
you all to make an acrobatics check with

2371
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:35,904
disadvantage.

2372
02:43:35,904 --> 02:43:37,533
DAN: How do I echolocate?

2373
02:43:37,533 --> 02:43:39,800
MATT: So roll 2d20 and drop the highest.

2374
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:42,011
IFY: Whoa, what? Roll--

2375
02:43:42,011 --> 02:43:44,048
LIAM: Roll twice and use the lowest one.

2376
02:43:44,048 --> 02:43:45,130
ZAC: Oh, well.

2377
02:43:45,130 --> 02:43:46,600
DAN: Rolled a two and a three.

2378
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:47,914
ZAC: Also two.

2379
02:43:47,914 --> 02:43:50,342
DAN: I got an 11.

2380
02:43:50,342 --> 02:43:51,512
MATT: Okay.

2381
02:43:51,512 --> 02:43:53,548
IFY: I rolled a--

2382
02:43:53,548 --> 02:43:56,109
ZAC: Wait, so what do I add that to?

2383
02:43:56,109 --> 02:43:58,575
DAN: Acrobatics, that'd be plus one.

2384
02:43:58,575 --> 02:44:00,308
ZAC: (laughs)

2385
02:44:00,308 --> 02:44:02,497
IFY: I rolled a 17.

2386
02:44:02,497 --> 02:44:03,532
MATT: 17.

2387
02:44:03,532 --> 02:44:04,331
ZAC: Three.

2388
02:44:04,331 --> 02:44:05,253
DAN: 11.

2389
02:44:05,253 --> 02:44:08,817
MATT: Three. All right. So you both impact on soft
sand and in the immediate point of impact you just

2390
02:44:08,817 --> 02:44:12,455
instinctively have, learning how to fall and
tumble, you manage to go with the momentum and

2391
02:44:12,455 --> 02:44:18,422
step out of the way of an impact, minimizing the
damage. You each take-- actually, you take two

2392
02:44:18,422 --> 02:44:23,064
points of damage, you take one point of damage.
You, however, go face-first into the top, taking a

2393
02:44:23,064 --> 02:44:28,692
significant amount of impact to your spine, your
neck, and your shoulders. You take four points of

2394
02:44:28,692 --> 02:44:34,536
damage from the fall and are now head buried like
an ostrich in the top of the sandpile with your

2395
02:44:34,536 --> 02:44:36,774
legs and arms dangling going like (muffled
yelling).

2396
02:44:36,774 --> 02:44:40,711
ZAC: (muffled) Get me up, get me up you son of a
bitch! Get me outta the ground!

2397
02:44:40,711 --> 02:44:42,693
DAN: Oh, I got sand-burn on me bairn.

2398
02:44:42,693 --> 02:44:48,061
IFY: Oh my god, that shit, I know. Oh, look here,
look at it, let's not help him, just look at it.

2399
02:44:48,061 --> 02:44:52,969
ZAC: (muffled) Damn dwarves! I hate dwarves!

2400
02:44:52,969 --> 02:44:54,945
DAN: I'm gonna try and pull him out.

2401
02:44:54,945 --> 02:44:58,027
MATT: It's not very hard, you yank him out at this
point. It is nearly pitch-black in this area, you

2402
02:44:58,027 --> 02:45:02,690
can barely see a couple feet in front of you. But
you can hear immediately, there is this distant

2403
02:45:02,690 --> 02:45:11,049
sound almost like the ringing of very very gentle
bells. It seems very out of place and perpetual,

2404
02:45:11,049 --> 02:45:12,850
and the tone shifts and overlaps.

2405
02:45:12,850 --> 02:45:14,643
IFY: Yo, y'all hear that?

2406
02:45:14,643 --> 02:45:16,807
DAN: Yeah, someone's playing crystal bells.

2407
02:45:16,807 --> 02:45:18,661
IFY: Nah, that's some money clinking right there.

2408
02:45:18,661 --> 02:45:20,044
ZAC: That's not-- I don't think that's money.

2409
02:45:20,044 --> 02:45:26,553
IFY: You ever clink some money together? And hear
that clinkling sound? Money be clinking.

2410
02:45:26,553 --> 02:45:30,357
ZAC: No, I think this is a great idea, run
straight towards it, why don't you? Just see, go,

2411
02:45:30,357 --> 02:45:31,680
run right to it.

2412
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:32,613
IFY: Nah.

2413
02:45:32,613 --> 02:45:34,000
ZAC: It's probably money, it's probably money.

2414
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:37,256
IFY: Last time we did something like that, we
ended up in a hole, and your head was

2415
02:45:37,409 --> 02:45:38,552
upside-down.

2416
02:45:38,552 --> 02:45:40,554
DAN: That was a great moment. I loved that.

2417
02:45:40,554 --> 02:45:43,479
IFY: See, it's moments like this that make
memories, you know what I'm saying?

2418
02:45:43,479 --> 02:45:45,288
DAN: I'm gonna see that when I go to sleep later.

2419
02:45:45,288 --> 02:45:46,475
IFY: Yeah.

2420
02:45:46,475 --> 02:45:49,872
DAN: So the room we're in, it's mostly sand. Does
it seem like there's--

2421
02:45:49,872 --> 02:45:51,500
MATT: You can only see a few feet in front of
you.

2422
02:45:51,500 --> 02:45:52,429
DAN: Okay.

2423
02:45:52,429 --> 02:45:53,771
MATT: Anyone have a torch or any sort of light
source?

2424
02:45:53,771 --> 02:45:57,534
IFY: Yeah, I have a torch. (sings) Got a torch in
my dungeoneer's pack.

2425
02:45:57,534 --> 02:45:59,358
(laughter)

2426
02:45:59,358 --> 02:46:01,291
DAN: I love your theme songs.

2427
02:46:01,291 --> 02:46:07,352
MATT: You light up a torch. As the light source
breathes out into the room, you can see there's a

2428
02:46:07,352 --> 02:46:14,351
large dome of sand that is slowly caved in from
the top surface of this small cave-in. However,

2429
02:46:14,351 --> 02:46:19,199
about 30 feet down it comes to rest in what looks
like some sort of a slightly toppled stone

2430
02:46:19,199 --> 02:46:23,005
structure that has been breached on this side,
almost like there was something deep under the

2431
02:46:23,005 --> 02:46:29,742
ground that has crumbled inward and the sand has
slowly poured into it. Also seems to be the source

2432
02:46:29,742 --> 02:46:32,734
of this strange ringing sound, this faint
ringing.

2433
02:46:32,734 --> 02:46:37,624
DAN: I'd like to investigate the stone object and
use Stone Cunning to go ahead and see if I can

2434
02:46:37,624 --> 02:46:38,634
find its origin.

2435
02:46:38,634 --> 02:46:39,345
MATT: Okay.

2436
02:46:39,345 --> 02:46:40,480
IFY: Use that Stone Cunning?

2437
02:46:40,480 --> 02:46:41,627
DAN: You know I know my stones.

2438
02:46:41,627 --> 02:46:44,509
IFY: Yeah, yeah, yo, and I give him dwarven dap,
because that's some dwarven stuff right there.

2439
02:46:44,509 --> 02:46:45,710
DAN: Dap it up proper.

2440
02:46:45,710 --> 02:46:47,090
IFY: That's that D shit right there.

2441
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:49,910
DAN: Oh, look at me, I'm a halfling, like get
real.

2442
02:46:49,910 --> 02:46:51,821
IFY: I know, yeah.

2443
02:46:51,821 --> 02:46:54,186
ZAC: Regardless of what you are, you are quite
useful in these situations.

2444
02:46:54,186 --> 02:47:00,296
IFY: Hey, my man Snuggle, look at the rock. You
can't tell me shit 'cause you're not a dwarf!

2445
02:47:00,296 --> 02:47:03,764
(laughs) You can't, man, you can't tell me shit
about rocks.

2446
02:47:03,764 --> 02:47:05,108
DAN: 'Cause you've been burnt.

2447
02:47:05,108 --> 02:47:08,971
ZAC: Oh yeah, your hand's looking really good
right now.

2448
02:47:08,971 --> 02:47:12,704
DAN: Yeah, like your self-confidence. Now let me
look at the stone.

2449
02:47:12,704 --> 02:47:13,876
IFY: I know.

2450
02:47:13,876 --> 02:47:16,862
MATT: (laughs) Go ahead and roll an investigation
check.

2451
02:47:16,862 --> 02:47:19,008
DAN: 15. Do I add anything for Stone Cunning?

2452
02:47:19,008 --> 02:47:21,645
MATT: I would say I'll give you advantage on the
roll, so you can roll a second time. Sure.

2453
02:47:21,645 --> 02:47:24,299
DAN: Okay. All right, I'm sticking with the 15.

2454
02:47:24,299 --> 02:47:28,640
MATT: All right. So as you step up to what looks
like the little bit of this stone outcropping

2455
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:33,944
that's slowly peering out of the earth, it looks
like this is the upper corner of a stone chamber

2456
02:47:33,944 --> 02:47:38,284
that has crumbled in a little bit, and you're now
peering into it from an elevated position outside

2457
02:47:38,284 --> 02:47:42,548
of the chamber. Looking at the structure of the
stone, the way it's built and carved and wedged

2458
02:47:42,548 --> 02:47:48,967
together to form the almost brick-like pattern of
its making, it's definitely not dwarven in make,

2459
02:47:48,967 --> 02:47:56,518
but it looks very old, and it looks like the
material itself is almost like a sandstone, and a

2460
02:47:56,518 --> 02:48:01,447
lot of civilizations that long existed before
proper stonecutting could be used, where stone

2461
02:48:01,447 --> 02:48:04,460
could be moved from nearby mountains or even the
dwarven stonecutting techniques were spread across

2462
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:10,098
this land, this was a very primitive way of
building subterranean structures. You gather this

2463
02:48:10,098 --> 02:48:16,400
interior is probably very, very old, well over a
thousand years. And as you peer down into it using

2464
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:22,046
the torchlight, you can see down within the
chamber, it's rectangular in shape, there appears

2465
02:48:22,046 --> 02:48:27,414
to be a trough with some sort of liquid that is in
an ovoid shape around a raised platform in the

2466
02:48:27,414 --> 02:48:31,496
center, and in the center of this platform, on top
of it, you can see a very, very dull blue glow

2467
02:48:31,496 --> 02:48:38,851
from this crystalline spherical orb that is
resting on it and is giving off this very, very

2468
02:48:38,851 --> 02:48:42,988
faint blue light. And the further you walk towards
it as you inspect the interior from the top of the

2469
02:48:43,143 --> 02:48:49,128
hole in this stone structure, you hear that
musical ringing sound get louder and louder as you

2470
02:48:49,128 --> 02:48:50,642
step towards it.

2471
02:48:50,642 --> 02:48:55,851
DAN: Got you. How big does the crystal look,
roughly in size, shape, and weight?

2472
02:48:55,851 --> 02:49:00,727
MATT: I'd say roughly baseball size, it's about
that big around. It's about 25 feet from you

2473
02:49:00,727 --> 02:49:02,074
currently.

2474
02:49:02,074 --> 02:49:04,568
ZAC: Can I check the room for traps?

2475
02:49:04,568 --> 02:49:06,542
MATT: You're welcome to, if you want to step up to
the corner.

2476
02:49:06,542 --> 02:49:08,724
IFY: You'd better do that quick, because that's a
big-ass crystal--

2477
02:49:08,724 --> 02:49:09,516
DAN: Oh yeah!

2478
02:49:09,516 --> 02:49:10,785
IFY: -- and that looks like it's worth a lot of
money.

2479
02:49:10,785 --> 02:49:11,928
DAN: I was just gonna say.

2480
02:49:11,928 --> 02:49:12,836
IFY: Yeah, you know.

2481
02:49:12,836 --> 02:49:13,933
ZAC: I really wanna check for traps before this
guy--

2482
02:49:13,933 --> 02:49:14,718
DAN: And I'm a rogue.

2483
02:49:14,718 --> 02:49:15,726
MATT: Make a perception check.

2484
02:49:15,726 --> 02:49:17,735
IFY: Yo, just hurry up and check it, man, 'cause
I'm about to run in there.

2485
02:49:17,735 --> 02:49:24,322
DAN: Plus perception. That's plus three. Yeah.
Perception.

2486
02:49:24,322 --> 02:49:25,913
ZAC: Okay. 22.

2487
02:49:25,913 --> 02:49:30,515
MATT: 22. As you step towards the edge of the
corner, you can see the sand that has spilled into

2488
02:49:30,515 --> 02:49:35,510
the room allows you a small decline to step into
the room if you'd like to. As you get to the edge

2489
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:42,470
of the sand, you glance at the nearby panels and
you can see, there are small language runes that

2490
02:49:42,470 --> 02:49:47,937
are carved into portions of the floor, many of
which seem to be just situationally part of a

2491
02:49:47,937 --> 02:49:51,638
hieroglyphic storytelling aspect, like the whole
room, but a language you don't understand. What

2492
02:49:51,638 --> 02:49:52,935
languages do you guys speak?

2493
02:49:52,935 --> 02:49:53,899
DAN: Common and Dwarven.

2494
02:49:53,899 --> 02:49:54,909
IFY: Yeah, Common and Dwarven.

2495
02:49:54,909 --> 02:49:56,054
ZAC: I have no idea.

2496
02:49:56,054 --> 02:50:00,927
MATT: We're gonna say you don't know it, 'cause it
keeps mystery abound. But you do notice that there

2497
02:50:00,927 --> 02:50:06,461
are a handful of runes across the floor, primarily
at the North-South-East-West-type portions of the

2498
02:50:06,461 --> 02:50:13,660
stone flooring surrounding the crystal, and where
that small water trough surrounds it. On the

2499
02:50:13,660 --> 02:50:20,462
outskirts of that water, on those positions, those
four corners, the runes are deeper-carved into the

2500
02:50:20,462 --> 02:50:27,330
stone and seem to almost have a quartz-like
texture to them, almost like there was something

2501
02:50:27,330 --> 02:50:30,391
quartz set into the stone floor.

2502
02:50:30,391 --> 02:50:37,532
ZAC: Hm. Hm. Totally clear, you should run down in
there and see what it's all about. Yeah.

2503
02:50:37,532 --> 02:50:43,112
DAN: Sounds great. I've got an idea. Does any of
you have something similar to the size of that

2504
02:50:43,112 --> 02:50:44,236
there gem?

2505
02:50:44,236 --> 02:50:45,254
ZAC: That's a good i--

2506
02:50:45,254 --> 02:50:46,275
IFY: Yo!

2507
02:50:46,275 --> 02:50:48,509
DAN: I'm gonna get a running start, I am going to
throw--

2508
02:50:48,509 --> 02:50:53,643
IFY: You sound like you're taking ideas from some
type of lore that may not exist on this plane, and

2509
02:50:53,643 --> 02:50:55,727
it sounds like a dumb-ass idea.

2510
02:50:55,727 --> 02:50:58,248
DAN: No, no. It's gonna be great. Trust me.

2511
02:50:58,248 --> 02:51:04,930
ZAC: I'm pretty sure I've heard this tale many,
many years ago, and I don't think it

2512
02:51:04,930 --> 02:51:06,907
works out too well.

2513
02:51:06,907 --> 02:51:10,451
DAN: This is anything but derivative. I don't know
what you're talking about.

2514
02:51:10,451 --> 02:51:12,180
ZAC: You've read the tale too, right?

2515
02:51:12,180 --> 02:51:13,287
IFY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2516
02:51:13,287 --> 02:51:16,663
ZAC: Yeah, there will be a giant boulder that will
come rolling down towards your face. I don't think

2517
02:51:16,663 --> 02:51:18,019
it will work.

2518
02:51:18,019 --> 02:51:24,881
IFY: Yo, how about this: rope test 2.0, okay? So
we're gonna get a rope, we're gonna throw it on

2519
02:51:24,881 --> 02:51:29,469
the floor. We're gonna throw the rope on the floor
and then, if anything happens, we know it's a

2520
02:51:29,469 --> 02:51:32,489
trap. If not, I'm gonna get my new gem.

2521
02:51:32,489 --> 02:51:37,069
ZAC: As long as you throw the rope, I'm okay with
this plan.

2522
02:51:37,069 --> 02:51:41,209
IFY: Swerve. All right, I'm gonna throw some
rope--

2523
02:51:41,209 --> 02:51:46,158
DAN: (laughs) More classic slang. Love it.

2524
02:51:46,158 --> 02:51:52,707
LIAM: It works for anything. (Scottish accent) Oh,
kitten masturbation. Classic dwarven slang.

2525
02:51:52,707 --> 02:51:56,609
DAN: You have to see it to believe it. Sounds like
these bells.

2526
02:51:56,609 --> 02:51:58,784
MARISHA: (Scottish accent) Vehicular manslaughter.
Classic dwarf.

2527
02:51:58,784 --> 02:52:03,142
MATT: All right, so as you step down into the
room, you take a little bit of the rope, you cut

2528
02:52:03,142 --> 02:52:07,113
if off with one of your swords, you take it, and
you toss it towards one of the small quartz-like

2529
02:52:07,113 --> 02:52:13,846
runes on the ground. It hits and comes to rest
over the small central quartz-type rune. A few

2530
02:52:13,846 --> 02:52:21,431
moments pass. No reaction. Then the room shudders
for a second, you feel the entire structure shake

2531
02:52:21,431 --> 02:52:23,153
with a sudden impact.

2532
02:52:23,153 --> 02:52:24,432
ZAC: Well, not good.

2533
02:52:24,432 --> 02:52:27,498
MATT: A little bit of the sand comes down and
settles to rest for a moment before you start

2534
02:52:27,498 --> 02:52:31,924
seeing certain blocks on the opposite sides of the
room begin to glow.

2535
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:34,316
IFY: Fuck.

2536
02:52:34,316 --> 02:52:35,517
DAN: Great.

2537
02:52:35,517 --> 02:52:40,953
MATT: As they glow, they begin to drift out of the
walls, almost suspended in the air, and begin to

2538
02:52:40,953 --> 02:52:46,042
lock together in different places, until
eventually it forms a haphazard humanoid figure in

2539
02:52:46,042 --> 02:52:47,346
a matter of seconds.

2540
02:52:47,346 --> 02:52:49,616
IFY: Oh, what is that? Damn! Whoa!

2541
02:52:49,616 --> 02:52:50,790
DAN: Oh, wow.

2542
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:56,940
IFY: This is some, like, weird, some, like...
what?

2543
02:52:56,940 --> 02:52:59,592
DAN: You took the words out of my mouth.

2544
02:52:59,592 --> 02:53:02,141
IFY: Oh, damn.

2545
02:53:02,141 --> 02:53:06,940
MATT: At which point, this hulking humanoid form,
probably standing at close to eight and a half,

2546
02:53:06,940 --> 02:53:12,588
nine feet tall, made of these sandstone blocks
that've been pulled from the wall, hands in place,

2547
02:53:12,588 --> 02:53:16,739
unmoving, the crystal on the side of the room
flashes with a vibrant blue light. As it does, in

2548
02:53:16,739 --> 02:53:21,284
the center of this chamber where the eyes and the
mouth of this humanoid would be, a similar blue

2549
02:53:21,284 --> 02:53:25,087
light suddenly flicks on, like it's been given
sudden sentience, at which point this large

2550
02:53:25,087 --> 02:53:31,425
sandstone golem-type entity begins to charge
towards you. Roll initiative.

2551
02:53:31,425 --> 02:53:35,644
(laughter)

2552
02:53:35,644 --> 02:53:38,175
ZAC: Okay, so what number's this?

2553
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:39,903
MATT: So you roll a d20 and add your initiative
modifier.

2554
02:53:39,903 --> 02:53:41,744
DAN: Roll and add initiative modifier, it's gonna
be plus one.

2555
02:53:41,744 --> 02:53:43,048
MARISHA: We fought some golems before.

2556
02:53:43,048 --> 02:53:43,830
ZAC: That's all I add?

2557
02:53:43,830 --> 02:53:44,577
DAN: Yeah.

2558
02:53:44,577 --> 02:53:45,683
MATT: All right, so.

2559
02:53:45,683 --> 02:53:47,167
DAN: 20.

2560
02:53:47,167 --> 02:53:48,272
MATT: 20.

2561
02:53:48,272 --> 02:53:49,146
ZAC: 16.

2562
02:53:49,146 --> 02:53:49,971
IFY: Six.

2563
02:53:49,971 --> 02:53:51,494
MATT: (laughs) Nice.

2564
02:53:51,494 --> 02:53:53,541
IFY: I like to call that the ringer, baby.

2565
02:53:53,541 --> 02:53:56,115
DAN: Clean up.

2566
02:53:56,115 --> 02:54:03,065
MATT: All right. So we're gonna say at the top of
the round, Salty, you got first up.

2567
02:54:03,065 --> 02:54:04,169
DAN: Oh, great.

2568
02:54:04,169 --> 02:54:06,480
MATT: You're still on the outskirts of the room
now, the only person who's really stepped in at

2569
02:54:06,480 --> 02:54:09,822
this point are the two of them, you're kind of
still in the back corner. So you see it charging

2570
02:54:09,822 --> 02:54:12,490
more towards these two, but you have the top of
the round, so.

2571
02:54:12,490 --> 02:54:17,588
DAN: I'd like to slink off to the right, draw my
shortbow, and try to shoot

2572
02:54:17,588 --> 02:54:19,174
an arrow at the crystal.

2573
02:54:19,174 --> 02:54:25,565
MATT: Okay, cool. So as you kind of slide down the
sand decline, you come around the edge, pull out

2574
02:54:25,565 --> 02:54:29,230
your shortbow, let it fly, go ahead and roll for
an attack.

2575
02:54:29,230 --> 02:54:33,442
MARISHA: San-de-cline? Eh? Sandy cline?

2576
02:54:33,442 --> 02:54:35,639
LIAM: He's showing his legitimate D&D roots.

2577
02:54:35,639 --> 02:54:36,554
DAN: 11.

2578
02:54:36,554 --> 02:54:41,479
MATT: 11. As you release the arrow, the shuddering of
each footstep of the golem itself is very

2579
02:54:41,540 --> 02:54:45,680
upsetting and in the chaos you let go of the
arrow, missing by a mere inch as it disappears

2580
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:46,672
into the darkness.

2581
02:54:46,672 --> 02:54:47,625
DAN: Ah, so close.

2582
02:54:47,625 --> 02:54:48,652
MATT: You hear it richochet--

2583
02:54:48,652 --> 02:54:50,877
IFY: You ain't no elf, man, you ain't no elf.
Shooting arrows.

2584
02:54:50,877 --> 02:54:52,326
DAN: I wake up every day ashamed.

2585
02:54:52,326 --> 02:54:53,325
IFY: Where's your weapon?

2586
02:54:53,325 --> 02:54:55,996
(laughter)

2587
02:54:55,996 --> 02:54:59,346
MATT: So that takes you to rest inside the
chamber, kind of off to the right of where the

2588
02:54:59,346 --> 02:55:01,113
rest of the party is. Next up, we have
Snugglelord.

2589
02:55:01,113 --> 02:55:02,434
ZAC: Okay, so.

2590
02:55:02,434 --> 02:55:03,774
MATT: It's coming towards you.

2591
02:55:03,774 --> 02:55:07,823
ZAC: It's running towards me really fast, I look
around me and I freak out and I go, "Oh shit!" And

2592
02:55:07,823 --> 02:55:09,907
I cast that Thauma--

2593
02:55:09,907 --> 02:55:10,829
DAN: Thaumaturgy?

2594
02:55:10,829 --> 02:55:11,766
MATT: Thaumaturgy?

2595
02:55:11,766 --> 02:55:15,419
ZAC: Thaumaturgy and make myself appear to be a
massive giant-like individual with a booming voice

2596
02:55:15,419 --> 02:55:20,217
and I intimidate him and go, "You are beneath me,
you foul creature!"

2597
02:55:20,217 --> 02:55:21,891
IFY: Yeah, make him punch you first.

2598
02:55:21,891 --> 02:55:30,351
MATT: So, for a moment this frightened, shaking
tiefling individual grounds himself, and this kind

2599
02:55:30,351 --> 02:55:34,633
of greenish energy begins to build around his
body. As it does, his physical form seems to

2600
02:55:34,633 --> 02:55:38,823
almost rise two to three feet, his shoulders
broaden, his face grows dark, his eyes begin to

2601
02:55:38,823 --> 02:55:43,119
spark with a fiery red light. The voice booms out
throughout the hallway, and the entirety of this

2602
02:55:43,119 --> 02:55:46,303
room's structure, catching you off-guard. Go ahead
and roll an intimidation check.

2603
02:55:46,303 --> 02:55:47,772
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

2604
02:55:47,772 --> 02:55:49,094
ZAC: Oh, fuck.

2605
02:55:49,094 --> 02:55:52,555
DAN: (laughs) Well, it could be okay.

2606
02:55:52,555 --> 02:55:53,508
ZAC: Eight.

2607
02:55:53,508 --> 02:55:54,652
MATT: Eight?

2608
02:55:54,652 --> 02:55:55,576
ZAC: Yeah.

2609
02:55:55,576 --> 02:55:56,398
MARISHA: Total?

2610
02:55:56,398 --> 02:55:57,962
ZAC: That's with a plus six.

2611
02:55:57,962 --> 02:56:03,154
MATT: Neither the speed, gait, or power of the
golem seem to have slowed, it continues to barrel

2612
02:56:03,154 --> 02:56:04,310
towards you.

2613
02:56:04,310 --> 02:56:06,428
ZAC: This was a bad idea, you guys. (panicked
yelling)

2614
02:56:06,428 --> 02:56:08,225
IFY: You just made him bigger. You just made him
bigger, man!

2615
02:56:08,225 --> 02:56:09,107
DAN: Oh no!

2616
02:56:09,107 --> 02:56:11,922
ZAC: Go go go, I'll pay you more money, I swear.

2617
02:56:11,922 --> 02:56:13,655
IFY: Ah, that's the magic.

2618
02:56:13,655 --> 02:56:19,020
ZAC: All of my earnings from this, like, that
dude, that dad, that bad father obviously, I'll

2619
02:56:19,020 --> 02:56:21,510
give you all of it, just take care of this for
me.

2620
02:56:21,510 --> 02:56:25,107
MATT: As you're saying this, the golem reaches
forward before you finish your sentence and goes

2621
02:56:25,107 --> 02:56:29,074
to grab you. What's your armor class?

2622
02:56:29,074 --> 02:56:33,856
ZAC: Studded leather, and 13 armor class?

2623
02:56:33,856 --> 02:56:42,951
MATT: Okay. You take five points of crushing
damage as the hand reaches, crushes down on your

2624
02:56:42,951 --> 02:56:46,359
shoulders and body, and lifts you off your feet.
You are now considered grappled.

2625
02:56:46,359 --> 02:56:50,302
ZAC: Motherfucker, this hurts! This hurts, get him
off of me! (high-pitched yelling)

2626
02:56:50,302 --> 02:56:54,586
DAN: He picked him up. He just grabbed him.

2627
02:56:54,586 --> 02:56:58,027
ZAC: Do something, you stupid dwarves! Do
something!

2628
02:56:58,027 --> 02:57:00,721
IFY: So if I'm swinging with two weapons, do I
roll twice?

2629
02:57:00,721 --> 02:57:03,514
MATT: You do use your bonus action for a second
attack, you just don't add your strength modifier

2630
02:57:03,514 --> 02:57:04,974
to the second attack.

2631
02:57:04,974 --> 02:57:09,123
IFY: So that's going to be 18.

2632
02:57:09,123 --> 02:57:10,927
MATT: 18, okay, and roll the second attack.

2633
02:57:10,927 --> 02:57:19,174
IFY: All right. Oh, and because I have the
two-weapon fighter, I still get to add the

2634
02:57:19,174 --> 02:57:20,208
strength modifier.

2635
02:57:20,208 --> 02:57:22,097
MATT: Oh, you do, awesome, so you can do both,
nice.

2636
02:57:22,097 --> 02:57:28,741
IFY: Oh, that one is going to be 12.

2637
02:57:28,741 --> 02:57:32,889
MATT: 12. 12 misses, unfortunately, but the first
attack does ring true. Go ahead and roll damage.

2638
02:57:32,889 --> 02:57:49,420
IFY: All right. Where are you, Mr. Eight? You are
not Mr. Eight. There it is. I swing for-- plus

2639
02:57:49,420 --> 02:57:52,314
strength, 11.

2640
02:57:52,314 --> 02:57:56,946
MATT: 11 points of damage, nice. So after it grabs
and picks up the tiefling, you can see the fingers

2641
02:57:56,946 --> 02:58:01,069
actually crushing as he's screaming, you pull the
weapons out, swing one that manages to pass under

2642
02:58:01,271 --> 02:58:05,320
its arm. The second one goes straight into its
torso and carves out a portion of the stone. Even

2643
02:58:05,320 --> 02:58:08,253
though the sandstone is a very hard surface, you
manage to find a portion between the bricks that

2644
02:58:08,253 --> 02:58:12,068
jammed together and actually carves a chunk of
brick out of the side of its torso. You can see

2645
02:58:12,068 --> 02:58:15,163
the structure kind of shifts a little bit on one
side and now it's kind of standing a little

2646
02:58:15,163 --> 02:58:20,000
off-kilter, but is still solid in its current
physical form. But well done, you carved a

2647
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,071
sizeable part out of it. Brings us--

2648
02:58:22,071 --> 02:58:23,085
DAN: Break it!

2649
02:58:23,085 --> 02:58:25,588
ZAC: I'm still being crushed, you dumbass, do
something!

2650
02:58:25,588 --> 02:58:27,037
IFY: Got some extra money.

2651
02:58:27,037 --> 02:58:28,448
MATT: Top of the round, Salty.

2652
02:58:28,448 --> 02:58:30,768
DAN: I'd like to reload my bow and take another
shot.

2653
02:58:30,768 --> 02:58:32,580
MARISHA: Reload that bow.

2654
02:58:32,580 --> 02:58:34,510
MATT: Go ahead and fire again.

2655
02:58:34,510 --> 02:58:35,607
MARISHA: Dat bow though.

2656
02:58:35,607 --> 02:58:38,832
ZAC: Is he trying the same thing? I can't see
anything, there's a giant hand covering my face!

2657
02:58:38,832 --> 02:58:43,965
DAN: You bet your ass. 13.

2658
02:58:43,965 --> 02:58:45,313
MATT: 13?

2659
02:58:45,313 --> 02:58:46,335
DAN: Mm-hm.

2660
02:58:46,335 --> 02:58:50,945
MATT: As you swing and release, this does hit the
crystal, but at a certain angle that causes it to

2661
02:58:50,945 --> 02:58:51,960
just glance off--

2662
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:53,337
DAN: Oh, come on! It hit the rim.

2663
02:58:53,337 --> 02:58:56,942
MATT: It did. It is a spherical object,
unfortunately it deflects coming piercing very

2664
02:58:56,942 --> 02:58:59,517
well. That close, but not quite enough to get to
it.

2665
02:58:59,517 --> 02:59:00,493
DAN: Rats.

2666
02:59:00,493 --> 02:59:01,774
MATT: Do you want to move, or are you gonna stay
where you are?

2667
02:59:01,774 --> 02:59:07,278
DAN: I'm going to, yeah, I'm gonna move back, I'm
gonna move closer by ten feet to the crystal.

2668
02:59:07,278 --> 02:59:10,933
MATT: Okay, so you shift up. You're now at the
outskirts of that liquid that's surrounding it.

2669
02:59:10,933 --> 02:59:12,157
DAN: Yeah.

2670
02:59:12,157 --> 02:59:15,739
MATT: Okay. It's only about five feet wide, so you
can leap over it easily. But you stop there? That

2671
02:59:15,739 --> 02:59:17,925
ends your turn. You're up, Snugs.

2672
02:59:17,925 --> 02:59:22,374
ZAC: Okay. Can I use the Hellish Rebuke on him?

2673
02:59:22,374 --> 02:59:23,324
MATT: You can.

2674
02:59:23,324 --> 02:59:24,474
ZAC: Am I allowed to do that?

2675
02:59:24,474 --> 02:59:29,358
MATT: You can. That's the Hellish Rebuke, as the
ability here-- pull it up real fast, because I

2676
02:59:29,358 --> 02:59:39,268
don't have any tieflings. Here we go. Hellish
Rebuke. That's a reaction you can make in

2677
02:59:39,268 --> 02:59:42,930
response. So you actually could've done that as
he's crushing you, which we'll say you do right

2678
02:59:42,930 --> 02:59:46,980
now. So as he's crushing you, you do that as a
reaction immediately. You point your finger and--

2679
02:59:46,980 --> 02:59:53,321
So as you're being crushed you're like ahh, you
point your finger at its arm.

2680
02:59:53,321 --> 02:59:54,223
ZAC: Eee!

2681
02:59:54,223 --> 02:59:57,321
DAN: The wet willy.

2682
02:59:57,321 --> 03:00:04,971
MATT: As you awkwardly finger the sandstone
golem's brick structure, it fails its saving throw

2683
03:00:04,971 --> 03:00:07,341
so it takes 2d10 fire damage.

2684
03:00:07,515 --> 03:00:09,754
DAN: What's on that finger?

2685
03:00:09,754 --> 03:00:13,533
MATT: Go ahead and roll. So ten-sider twice.

2686
03:00:13,533 --> 03:00:14,993
ZAC: Ten-sider. Okay.

2687
03:00:14,993 --> 03:00:17,029
MARISHA: Had some habanero sauce recently?

2688
03:00:17,029 --> 03:00:18,836
DAN: Yeah, it's a spicy fingerblast.

2689
03:00:18,836 --> 03:00:20,256
ZAC: Two and four.

2690
03:00:20,256 --> 03:00:24,868
MATT: Two and four? So six points of fire damage.
As your finger enters the portion between the

2691
03:00:24,868 --> 03:00:29,459
bricks, there's a burst of flame and it looks like
an impact of some sort of internal arcane

2692
03:00:29,459 --> 03:00:34,354
explosion, causing the sutures between all the
different bricks to shake for a second. You see

2693
03:00:34,354 --> 03:00:39,122
dust and sand settle between the portions of its
torso that are holding its limbs to it. A pretty

2694
03:00:39,122 --> 03:00:43,843
sizeable impact from an unexpected position. So
that was your reaction. Now what do you wanna do

2695
03:00:43,843 --> 03:00:44,813
for your turn?

2696
03:00:44,813 --> 03:00:48,830
ZAC: Okay, great. So the cantrips can be used--

2697
03:00:48,830 --> 03:00:49,752
MATT: As many times as you want.

2698
03:00:49,752 --> 03:00:50,993
ZAC: -- as many times as I want.

2699
03:00:50,993 --> 03:00:52,907
IFY: Yeah, do some more of that fire stuff, it's
working, man!

2700
03:00:52,907 --> 03:00:56,600
DAN: Cast a spell, it'll be great! Do more of that
finger stuff!

2701
03:00:56,600 --> 03:01:01,250
ZAC: I'm gonna use the Poison Spray on him.

2702
03:01:01,250 --> 03:01:02,418
MATT: Okay, okay.

2703
03:01:02,418 --> 03:01:03,654
ZAC: See if that does anything.

2704
03:01:03,654 --> 03:01:05,706
IFY: Yo, you trying to poison some magic stuff?

2705
03:01:05,706 --> 03:01:12,031
DAN: Sandstone's greatest weakness. Poison.

2706
03:01:12,031 --> 03:01:18,960
MATT: (laughs) All right, so. You bring your hand
out towards the creature, you release this sudden

2707
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:20,545
burst of poisonous gas--

2708
03:01:20,545 --> 03:01:25,194
ZAC: I'm panicking, assholes, I'm freaking held up
by the top of my head, this is really excruciating

2709
03:01:25,194 --> 03:01:28,775
pain, I may have made a poor decision, I don't
know, I'm just doing something!

2710
03:01:28,775 --> 03:01:33,389
MATT: As the cloud swarms around the entity, it
does not seem to be affected by the presence of

2711
03:01:33,389 --> 03:01:38,789
poison, as its physical form does not fall under
the category of a natural living entity. However,

2712
03:01:38,789 --> 03:01:41,656
you can use your movement to try and break free of
the grapple.

2713
03:01:41,656 --> 03:01:43,794
ZAC: So I try to run away--

2714
03:01:43,794 --> 03:01:47,374
MATT: Okay, so you try and break out. Go ahead and
you can make either an athletics or an acrobatics

2715
03:01:47,374 --> 03:01:48,582
roll, your choice.

2716
03:01:48,582 --> 03:01:49,606
ZAC: Well--

2717
03:01:49,606 --> 03:01:51,683
DAN: You should acrobatics. (laughs)

2718
03:01:51,683 --> 03:01:52,820
ZAC: Acrobatics.

2719
03:01:52,820 --> 03:01:55,116
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll acrobatics.

2720
03:01:55,116 --> 03:01:57,741
ZAC: Okay, that's 12.

2721
03:01:57,741 --> 03:02:01,757
MATT: 12? All right! You manage to just squeeze
out of its grip, land on your feet, and get back

2722
03:02:01,757 --> 03:02:04,257
about five feet. It's still right in front of you,
but you're no longer in its grasp.

2723
03:02:04,257 --> 03:02:05,847
DAN: Slippery bastard!

2724
03:02:05,847 --> 03:02:11,859
MATT: Okay, so as its turn it's going to do
Frenzied Punches, it's gonna do an attack on both

2725
03:02:11,859 --> 03:02:16,021
of you. Just giant fists, it clenches its fingers
together into two giant hammers of sandstone.

2726
03:02:16,021 --> 03:02:21,699
ZAC: Ah, dammit, no, I can't take this kind of
punishment! You're supposed to take these!

2727
03:02:21,699 --> 03:02:24,261
MATT: That's going to be a 16 against you.

2728
03:02:24,261 --> 03:02:25,859
IFY: My armor class is 16.

2729
03:02:25,859 --> 03:02:30,586
MATT: It just manages to impact. So as one fist
goes, bang, hitting you right in the breadbasket,

2730
03:02:30,675 --> 03:02:33,649
you can feel the armor absorbs a lot of the blow,
but it still nearly knocks the wind out of you.

2731
03:02:33,649 --> 03:02:35,001
DAN: Not the basket.

2732
03:02:35,001 --> 03:02:39,117
MATT: You take seven points of bludgeoning
damage.

2733
03:02:39,117 --> 03:02:40,556
IFY: God damn!

2734
03:02:40,556 --> 03:02:43,513
MATT: From the sheer impact and force of the blow.
As it pulls its fist back,

2735
03:02:43,513 --> 03:02:45,493
it backhands towards you.

2736
03:02:45,493 --> 03:02:47,365
ZAC: Of course, yeah, it gives me the backhand.

2737
03:02:47,365 --> 03:02:50,078
MATT: That's gonna be an eight. What's your armor
class?

2738
03:02:50,078 --> 03:02:50,993
ZAC: 13.

2739
03:02:50,993 --> 03:02:54,856
MATT: 13. You duck beneath the arc, and it swings
wildly, missing you entirely.

2740
03:02:54,856 --> 03:02:59,523
IFY: All our luck's been wasted on you, man. That
hurt.

2741
03:02:59,523 --> 03:03:01,635
MATT: Ulfgar, it's your turn now, as you recover
from the blow.

2742
03:03:01,635 --> 03:03:03,279
ZAC: You got this, you got this!

2743
03:03:03,279 --> 03:03:08,194
IFY: Oh, nobody punches me in the chest and lives
to tell the tale. So I'm gonna go ahead and

2744
03:03:08,194 --> 03:03:13,362
slice-and-dice. All right, Regina! I swing for--

2745
03:03:13,362 --> 03:03:15,746
DAN: His right-hand sword.

2746
03:03:15,746 --> 03:03:17,142
IFY: -- 21.

2747
03:03:17,142 --> 03:03:19,269
MATT: 21 hits. Roll the second attack.

2748
03:03:19,269 --> 03:03:21,646
ZAC: You announce it. "His right-hand sword!"

2749
03:03:21,646 --> 03:03:23,697
DAN: I just love color commentary.

2750
03:03:23,697 --> 03:03:28,977
IFY: And Linda! And with Linda I swing for 19.

2751
03:03:28,977 --> 03:03:30,926
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on both
strikes.

2752
03:03:30,926 --> 03:03:39,989
IFY: Oh yeah! (laughs) So, um. Regina smacks for
five.

2753
03:03:39,989 --> 03:03:41,265
MATT: Five damage.

2754
03:03:41,265 --> 03:03:44,699
IFY: Linda smacks for 11.

2755
03:03:44,699 --> 03:03:50,343
MATT: Nice! So you bring both swings down
simultaneously, streaking an X-mark strike across

2756
03:03:50,343 --> 03:03:54,582
its back. As you do, you carve a sizeable rock
from the side of its back. As the stones tumble

2757
03:03:54,582 --> 03:03:59,759
off of its torso, and its shoulder area, it hits
the ground and they just turn to dust upon impact

2758
03:03:59,759 --> 03:04:03,729
with the ground. You can see now, within the
sandstone in the center, there is kind of a

2759
03:04:03,729 --> 03:04:08,805
crackling arcane energy, almost like a spider-like
electricity that is holding its form together that

2760
03:04:08,805 --> 03:04:12,626
is the same color as the stone in the center of
the room. Do you want to move at all, or are you

2761
03:04:12,626 --> 03:04:14,004
going to stay where you are?

2762
03:04:14,004 --> 03:04:17,620
IFY: I think I'm gonna stay there and actually use
an Action Surge to swing

2763
03:04:17,620 --> 03:04:20,710
at the innards of this beast.

2764
03:04:20,710 --> 03:04:22,579
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll another attack.

2765
03:04:22,579 --> 03:04:24,014
MARISHA: Oh, snap!

2766
03:04:24,014 --> 03:04:28,395
DAN: Like the Magic School Bus, going inside.

2767
03:04:28,395 --> 03:04:30,727
IFY: That is going to be 14.

2768
03:04:30,727 --> 03:04:33,125
MARISHA: I knew I should've stayed home today.

2769
03:04:33,125 --> 03:04:35,773
MATT: 14. With this action-surge strike you go, and
you bring your sword down. As your sword gets

2770
03:04:35,773 --> 03:04:40,990
within a few inches of the back, a bit of that
blue energy arcs out and hits the blade, causing

2771
03:04:41,055 --> 03:04:46,399
your hand to recoil instinctively. You drop the
weapon for a second from the sheer shock of it,

2772
03:04:46,399 --> 03:04:50,351
realize what you've done, and reach down and pick
it up again. It manages to knock your attack out

2773
03:04:50,351 --> 03:04:52,072
of use, unfortunately.

2774
03:04:52,072 --> 03:04:56,583
IFY: Oh. Go for the crystal! I think the blue
stuff might work!

2775
03:04:56,583 --> 03:04:58,231
DAN: Yeah, you think?

2776
03:04:58,231 --> 03:05:00,573
MATT: That brings us up to the top. Salty, you're
up.

2777
03:05:00,573 --> 03:05:01,475
DAN: All right--

2778
03:05:01,475 --> 03:05:04,733
ZAC: Do it again, I know I said it was stupid last
time, but go for it!

2779
03:05:04,733 --> 03:05:11,389
DAN: I'm gonna believe in myself. I'm gonna sprint
towards the crystal, leap through the air, doing a

2780
03:05:11,389 --> 03:05:13,639
flip, grabbing it, and taking it out of its hold.

2781
03:05:13,639 --> 03:05:17,301
IFY: Is the flip just natural? You just had to add
the flip?

2782
03:05:17,301 --> 03:05:18,318
MATT: All right.

2783
03:05:18,318 --> 03:05:19,441
DAN: Go for broke.

2784
03:05:19,441 --> 03:05:22,556
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics roll.

2785
03:05:22,556 --> 03:05:23,731
DAN: I got a one.

2786
03:05:23,731 --> 03:05:26,090
(laughter)

2787
03:05:26,090 --> 03:05:30,042
DAN: This die is terrible. This is hot garbage.

2788
03:05:30,042 --> 03:05:31,572
MARISHA: Another die!

2789
03:05:31,572 --> 03:05:36,799
MATT: You back up, pushing off the back wall of
the room. You go into a ninja sprint, leap through

2790
03:05:36,799 --> 03:05:42,212
the air, over the moat of brackish liquid around
the orb. You reach out and realize you're about a

2791
03:05:42,212 --> 03:05:46,777
foot and a half too high. You reach down for it,
pass through your fingers, you tumble over and

2792
03:05:46,777 --> 03:05:51,591
land back-first into the other side of the moat.
(splash) Splashing liquid all over your back and

2793
03:05:51,591 --> 03:05:56,031
torso, you tumble off, slide across to the side of
the room, slam!, hitting the opposite side of the

2794
03:05:56,031 --> 03:06:00,329
wall on your back, your feet, ass-up,
ass-over-teakettle.

2795
03:06:00,329 --> 03:06:02,050
DAN: Never believe in yourself.

2796
03:06:02,050 --> 03:06:04,893
(laughter)

2797
03:06:04,893 --> 03:06:09,532
MATT: You are considered prone and you take three
points of acid damage from splashing

2798
03:06:09,532 --> 03:06:10,730
into the liquid.

2799
03:06:10,730 --> 03:06:12,185
DAN: Oh, god.

2800
03:06:12,185 --> 03:06:14,494
MATT: Snugglelord, you're up.

2801
03:06:14,494 --> 03:06:24,350
MARISHA: Believing in yourself is a lie. Once
again, D&D teaches real life lessons.

2802
03:06:24,350 --> 03:06:30,433
ZAC: It's coming for me!

2803
03:06:30,433 --> 03:06:32,329
DAN: I almost got it!

2804
03:06:32,329 --> 03:06:35,077
ZAC: I know! Man. It's a--

2805
03:06:35,077 --> 03:06:37,650
DAN: Are you casting a spell called Friends?

2806
03:06:37,650 --> 03:06:43,151
ZAC: Oh, no I can't, no I can't. I can't do it
because he's hostile towards me. I cast fire into

2807
03:06:43,151 --> 03:06:49,043
the weak spot on the back to see if fire does
anything to disrupt the energy that's inside it.

2808
03:06:49,043 --> 03:06:50,430
MATT: What spell are you using for that?

2809
03:06:50,430 --> 03:06:51,593
ZAC: Thauma--

2810
03:06:51,593 --> 03:06:52,642
MATT: Thaumaturgy?

2811
03:06:52,642 --> 03:06:53,732
ZAC: Thaumaturgy.

2812
03:06:53,732 --> 03:06:56,888
MATT: Okay, as you focus for a second, you raise
your hand up in the air, using your demonic

2813
03:06:56,888 --> 03:07:02,147
heritage to call forth some infernal fire that
bursts for a second in the center of where that

2814
03:07:02,147 --> 03:07:06,565
electricity is. It sparks up and then is snuffed,
no seeming effect.

2815
03:07:06,565 --> 03:07:09,292
ZAC: Am I allowed to move after that?

2816
03:07:09,292 --> 03:07:10,451
MATT: You can move after that, yeah.

2817
03:07:10,451 --> 03:07:13,426
ZAC: I move a couple steps back, like, whoa, shit
shit shit shit shit.

2818
03:07:13,426 --> 03:07:18,546
MATT: Okay, so you carefully step away. It takes a
swing at you as you step out of its range. That is

2819
03:07:18,546 --> 03:07:19,289
gonna be--

2820
03:07:19,289 --> 03:07:20,281
DAN: Attack of opportunity.

2821
03:07:20,281 --> 03:07:21,891
MATT: -- 11. Which I believe misses you.

2822
03:07:21,891 --> 03:07:22,730
ZAC: Yes.

2823
03:07:22,730 --> 03:07:26,764
MATT: So as you step out of the way, it comes down
with a giant fist hammer-blow style, as you

2824
03:07:26,810 --> 03:07:29,315
sidestep out of the way, as it cracks some of the
stone on the ground.

2825
03:07:29,315 --> 03:07:31,860
ZAC: Can we all take a second to laugh at how
great what Salty just did was,

2826
03:07:31,860 --> 03:07:33,285
because that was amazing!

2827
03:07:33,285 --> 03:07:34,910
DAN: It was pretty great.

2828
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:36,168
MATT: Ulfgar, you're up.

2829
03:07:36,168 --> 03:07:37,470
DAN: I'm in so much pain.

2830
03:07:37,470 --> 03:07:41,239
IFY: All right. Am I close enough to the crystal
to run towards it?

2831
03:07:41,239 --> 03:07:44,878
MATT: You can, you'd probably take an attack from
the creature, but--

2832
03:07:44,878 --> 03:07:49,395
IFY: All right. Yeah, I run towards it, safely,
not trying to do any fancy flips or anything.

2833
03:07:49,395 --> 03:07:57,881
MATT: Okay, so as you rush past, it swings out at
you. That's gonna be a 14. I think you said your

2834
03:07:57,881 --> 03:07:58,931
AC's 16?

2835
03:07:58,931 --> 03:07:59,772
IFY: Yeah.

2836
03:07:59,772 --> 03:08:02,795
MATT: So you just, it glances off your shoulder,
you take the blow but keep pushing forward with

2837
03:08:02,795 --> 03:08:04,608
the sheer force of your dwarven physical self.

2838
03:08:04,608 --> 03:08:05,385
IFY: Woo!

2839
03:08:05,385 --> 03:08:09,240
MATT: As you leap just over the liquid, I'm just
gonna make you, have you do a

2840
03:08:09,240 --> 03:08:10,679
quick athletics roll.

2841
03:08:10,679 --> 03:08:18,060
IFY: All right. I rolled 24.

2842
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:19,055
MATT: 24.

2843
03:08:19,055 --> 03:08:20,209
DAN: Oh, come on.

2844
03:08:20,209 --> 03:08:22,060
MATT: You leap across, three-point landing.

2845
03:08:22,060 --> 03:08:23,139
IFY: Kobe!

2846
03:08:23,139 --> 03:08:25,971
MATT: You stand up, the orb's there in front of
you. You wanted to grab the orb, you said? You

2847
03:08:25,971 --> 03:08:28,243
wanna grab the orb, you said?

2848
03:08:28,243 --> 03:08:29,012
IFY: Yes.

2849
03:08:29,012 --> 03:08:33,406
MATT: Okay. You grab the orb, you pull it off the
pedestal. Make a constitution saving throw.

2850
03:08:33,406 --> 03:08:35,220
DAN: (laughs) Classic slang.

2851
03:08:35,220 --> 03:08:40,114
(laughter)

2852
03:08:40,114 --> 03:08:45,045
IFY: I, so, constitution. I roll a god damn 24.

2853
03:08:45,045 --> 03:08:50,811
MATT: 24. As you clutch the orb, you can feel for
a moment the electrical energy surging through

2854
03:08:50,811 --> 03:08:54,977
your forearms and into your body, and for a second
your muscles tense and you feel like your physical

2855
03:08:54,977 --> 03:08:59,426
form is being slowed down, but you shrug it off
for a second as you're clutching it in your hands

2856
03:08:59,426 --> 03:09:02,614
right now. You're looking at it, you've pulled it
off of the pedestal. As you pull it off the

2857
03:09:02,614 --> 03:09:07,747
pedestal, it leaves a couple trails of sparks off
the top that stretch out between the pedestal and

2858
03:09:07,747 --> 03:09:13,384
where you're pulling the orb off. You look back
and the entity currently is looking like it's

2859
03:09:13,384 --> 03:09:18,037
slowing in its physical ability to move around
when it's in your grasp, but it's still turning

2860
03:09:18,037 --> 03:09:23,241
around towards you, kind of looking, noticing that
you've now grabbed something that is inherently

2861
03:09:23,241 --> 03:09:25,287
connected to its physicality.

2862
03:09:25,287 --> 03:09:34,360
IFY: All right. Then I break it and say, "I own
you!"

2863
03:09:34,360 --> 03:09:35,597
MATT: Make an attack.

2864
03:09:35,597 --> 03:09:36,694
(laughter)

2865
03:09:36,694 --> 03:09:38,424
DAN: Great breath control.

2866
03:09:38,424 --> 03:09:43,431
IFY: 14.

2867
03:09:43,431 --> 03:09:52,296
MATT: 14? All right. You take the orb, you spike
it on the ground, and you see it crack upon the

2868
03:09:52,296 --> 03:09:57,870
impact. It doesn't break, but a big solid crack
suddenly spiders through the entire interior of

2869
03:09:57,870 --> 03:10:05,506
the orb, as it rolls off and into the liquid on
the outskirts. You can see the electrical center

2870
03:10:05,506 --> 03:10:10,586
in the center of the sandstone golem flicker and
flash with light, and you see one of its arms hits

2871
03:10:10,586 --> 03:10:15,061
the ground behind it and scatters into dust and
sand. It's still keeping its form together, and

2872
03:10:15,061 --> 03:10:20,031
it's kind of lurching towards you with its other
arm rearing back for some sort of an attack, but

2873
03:10:20,031 --> 03:10:23,374
it looks like it's having a really hard time
holding itself together. That's gonna end your

2874
03:10:23,374 --> 03:10:24,642
turn. Salty, you're up.

2875
03:10:24,642 --> 03:10:28,207
IFY: Salty, you gotta put your hand in the juice
again! You gotta put your hand in that juice, get

2876
03:10:28,207 --> 03:10:29,063
that orb.

2877
03:10:29,063 --> 03:10:30,346
DAN: You can't be serious.

2878
03:10:30,346 --> 03:10:33,062
MARISHA: Believe! Believe, Salty!

2879
03:10:33,062 --> 03:10:35,260
DAN: No, it never works.

2880
03:10:35,260 --> 03:10:37,064
IFY: Just put your hand in the juice!

2881
03:10:37,064 --> 03:10:40,666
DAN: I'm going to-- so if I'm not mistaken, I can
expend a hit die to regain some health,

2882
03:10:40,666 --> 03:10:41,770
is that true?

2883
03:10:41,770 --> 03:10:44,658
MATT: You can during a rest, not in the middle of
combat, unfortunately.

2884
03:10:44,658 --> 03:10:47,149
IFY: (laughs) You got this, baby!

2885
03:10:47,149 --> 03:10:52,201
DAN: All right. I've got, I think I have three hit
points left, maybe? Five or three. Somewhere, I

2886
03:10:52,201 --> 03:10:56,044
think I'm at five. So, sorry, the orb is in--

2887
03:10:56,044 --> 03:11:02,058
MATT: It's currently-- he slammed it into the
ground, it cracked, and it rolled into the moat on

2888
03:11:02,058 --> 03:11:04,760
the-- to you it would be on the right side of the
building right now.

2889
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:15,271
DAN: Oh, come on. All right. I'm going to take my
cape, wrap it around my arm, and just run and

2890
03:11:15,271 --> 03:11:16,324
scoop it.

2891
03:11:16,324 --> 03:11:19,980
MATT: Okay. So you use half your movement to get
up, and you rush towards, you can get just to the

2892
03:11:19,980 --> 03:11:24,093
outside of it, 'cause you can see a little bit of
the blue interior. You reach down inside, you pull

2893
03:11:24,093 --> 03:11:26,985
it up. I want you to go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw.

2894
03:11:26,985 --> 03:11:29,831
IFY: You got this, Salty!

2895
03:11:29,831 --> 03:11:31,092
DAN: Not using that die again.

2896
03:11:31,092 --> 03:11:32,788
ZAC: I kind of believe in you!

2897
03:11:32,788 --> 03:11:35,392
DAN: Oh, you shouldn't have done that. That'll be
a seven.

2898
03:11:35,583 --> 03:11:37,333
MARISHA: Oh no, Salty.

2899
03:11:37,333 --> 03:11:40,798
MATT: So as you pick up the orb, you grab it
triumphantly in your hand, you can see the liquid,

2900
03:11:40,798 --> 03:11:45,628
it's not touching your skin for once. However,
there is a surge of electrical energy into your

2901
03:11:45,628 --> 03:11:49,737
body, and as you grasp it you can feel the muscles
in your arm and shoulder and back all tense up.

2902
03:11:49,737 --> 03:11:53,387
You find yourself held in place, unable to move.

2903
03:11:53,387 --> 03:11:56,540
DAN: Guys, little help?

2904
03:11:56,540 --> 03:11:59,553
MATT: That ends your turn. That brings us to
Snugglelord, what you got?

2905
03:11:59,553 --> 03:12:00,612
ZAC: Shit!

2906
03:12:00,612 --> 03:12:03,736
IFY: It's the orb, break that orb, man! It's the
orb.

2907
03:12:03,736 --> 03:12:07,702
ZAC: I pull out my crossbow.

2908
03:12:07,702 --> 03:12:10,532
IFY: Oh no, no! Anything but that!

2909
03:12:10,532 --> 03:12:16,530
DAN: I always knew it would end like this. That's
what the gypsy woman said.

2910
03:12:16,530 --> 03:12:18,289
MATT: You have other spells.

2911
03:12:18,289 --> 03:12:22,084
ZAC: Not really, I picked terrible spells for
this.

2912
03:12:22,084 --> 03:12:25,046
MATT: Your first-level spells, you have three you
should have.

2913
03:12:25,046 --> 03:12:27,782
LIAM: Wait, what's your melee weapon?

2914
03:12:27,782 --> 03:12:29,784
ORION: Eldritch Blast, Eldritch Blast!

2915
03:12:29,784 --> 03:12:31,289
ZAC: I have a handaxe.

2916
03:12:31,289 --> 03:12:32,644
MATT: Do you have Eldritch Blast?

2917
03:12:32,644 --> 03:12:33,654
MARISHA: Do you have Eldritch Blast?

2918
03:12:33,654 --> 03:12:34,920
LIAM: No, he doesn't have Eldritch Blast.

2919
03:12:34,920 --> 03:12:39,039
ZAC: No, all the spells that I picked are all
based on me lying to people.

2920
03:12:39,039 --> 03:12:42,744
I am worthless in a battle.

2921
03:12:42,744 --> 03:12:43,757
LIAM: Smash it!

2922
03:12:43,757 --> 03:12:47,198
ZAC: Okay, I'm gonna smash it, I'm gonna run up
and smash it in his hand.

2923
03:12:47,198 --> 03:12:48,534
DAN: Please, no!

2924
03:12:48,534 --> 03:12:53,413
IFY: Don't worry, don't worry, Salty, I'll drink
to your name!

2925
03:12:53,413 --> 03:12:56,561
ZAC: I'm honestly not worried about his hand, he's
already lost a lot of use of it, the skin is gone,

2926
03:12:56,735 --> 03:13:01,565
like, he'll be, it doesn't matter, you're not
gonna masturbate with that thing anyway anymore.

2927
03:13:01,714 --> 03:13:02,691
DAN: I never did.

2928
03:13:02,691 --> 03:13:10,562
MATT: So Snugglelord's tiefling form darts in and
in the shaded interior of the room runs across. Go

2929
03:13:10,562 --> 03:13:14,607
ahead and just make an acrobatics check real fast
as you cross the moat.

2930
03:13:14,607 --> 03:13:18,367
LIAM: Oh, sever his wanking hand, classic dwarven
move!

2931
03:13:18,367 --> 03:13:21,609
DAN: Classic tiefling betrayal!

2932
03:13:21,609 --> 03:13:23,051
ZAC: Okay, all right. 19.

2933
03:13:23,051 --> 03:13:26,265
MATT: 19. You leap over without an issue, you
actually tumble and roll on the ground. As you

2934
03:13:26,265 --> 03:13:31,163
come up, you use the inertia to swing your axe in
a wide arc down towards his hand. Roll an attack.

2935
03:13:31,163 --> 03:13:37,673
IFY: I'll drink to your name, man, 'cause you're
about to be dead!

2936
03:13:37,673 --> 03:13:39,863
ZAC: Okay, what do I add on these?

2937
03:13:39,863 --> 03:13:42,036
DAN: 15? You beat a 14 armor class, you hit.

2938
03:13:42,036 --> 03:13:44,503
LIAM: Dan Casey, still in character, holding up
the orb.

2939
03:13:44,503 --> 03:13:46,718
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll damage for the
axe.

2940
03:13:46,718 --> 03:13:49,249
DAN: Oh, this is gonna suck.

2941
03:13:49,249 --> 03:13:51,498
ZAC: What do I do for damage dice?

2942
03:13:51,498 --> 03:13:52,563
IFY: 1d6.

2943
03:13:52,563 --> 03:13:54,777
MATT: 1d6 and add your strength modifier to it.

2944
03:13:54,777 --> 03:13:55,930
ZAC: Well, that's nothing.

2945
03:13:55,930 --> 03:13:56,938
IFY: Zero.

2946
03:13:56,938 --> 03:13:58,042
ZAC: One.

2947
03:13:58,042 --> 03:13:59,121
LIAM: No!

2948
03:13:59,121 --> 03:14:01,775
ORION: That's for the attack.

2949
03:14:01,775 --> 03:14:02,930
MATT: One's all you needed.

2950
03:14:02,930 --> 03:14:04,164
MARISHA: One's all he needed?

2951
03:14:04,164 --> 03:14:07,131
MATT: The crystal is already heavily damaged. You
bring the axe down.

2952
03:14:07,131 --> 03:14:09,595
DAN: Ah, god!

2953
03:14:09,595 --> 03:14:16,639
MATT: It shatters the crystal into a hundred
pieces across the room. I want you to go ahead and

2954
03:14:16,639 --> 03:14:19,009
roll another damage attack on his hand.

2955
03:14:19,009 --> 03:14:20,795
DAN: Fucking great.

2956
03:14:20,795 --> 03:14:22,447
MARISHA: How many hit points did you have left?

2957
03:14:22,447 --> 03:14:26,278
DAN: Five on a good day. Three more
realistically.

2958
03:14:26,278 --> 03:14:30,298
ZAC: Low roll, low roll, low roll.

2959
03:14:30,298 --> 03:14:31,163
IFY: Five.

2960
03:14:31,163 --> 03:14:32,023
ZAC: Five.

2961
03:14:32,023 --> 03:14:33,072
(laughter)

2962
03:14:33,072 --> 03:14:34,175
DAN: That's a whammy!

2963
03:14:34,175 --> 03:14:38,843
MATT: So as the crystal shatters, you can see the
golem form, which is coming up behind you with a

2964
03:14:38,843 --> 03:14:45,014
giant piston-like hand, suddenly just vanishes
into dust and sparks as it scatters across the

2965
03:14:45,014 --> 03:14:49,690
ground. The axe swings through, and you're
extremely excited at the impact as you look up and

2966
03:14:49,690 --> 03:14:54,176
see what is a fingerless half-hand now bleeding
profusely.

2967
03:14:54,176 --> 03:14:55,738
ZAC: Haha, you look better now!

2968
03:14:55,738 --> 03:14:58,549
DAN: Oh, everybody's a fucking comedian.

2969
03:14:58,549 --> 03:15:02,779
MATT: Which is the last words you say before you
fall unconscious on the ground from the severe

2970
03:15:02,779 --> 03:15:04,319
shock and blood loss.

2971
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:08,244
ZAC: We did it!

2972
03:15:08,244 --> 03:15:10,818
IFY: Aw man, I really liked that dude, man.

2973
03:15:10,818 --> 03:15:13,613
ZAC: He's fine, he just lost some fingers.

2974
03:15:13,613 --> 03:15:20,840
MATT: So as he's now unconscious on the ground,
bleeding out, does anyone wanna try and help him?

2975
03:15:20,840 --> 03:15:23,352
IFY: Yeah, I'm gonna try and resurrect him in some
way.

2976
03:15:23,352 --> 03:15:28,966
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a medicine check.
Do you have a medicine kit or anything like that?

2977
03:15:29,012 --> 03:15:30,391
ZAC: I don't have one.

2978
03:15:30,391 --> 03:15:32,306
ORION: Yes, say yes, Thaumaturgy.

2979
03:15:32,306 --> 03:15:33,811
IFY: I just have the dungeoneer's kit.

2980
03:15:33,811 --> 03:15:35,005
MATT: All right, make a medicine check.

2981
03:15:35,005 --> 03:15:36,355
DAN: Cauterize the wound.

2982
03:15:36,355 --> 03:15:39,228
MARISHA: Are you trying to say stop the bleeding
with Thaumaturgy? Is that what

2983
03:15:39,228 --> 03:15:40,190
you're trying to say?

2984
03:15:40,190 --> 03:15:41,937
DAN: Yeah, cauterize my stump.

2985
03:15:41,937 --> 03:15:43,325
MARISHA: By screaming at it?

2986
03:15:43,325 --> 03:15:46,727
LIAM: He could stick a dagger into the end of that,
he'll be fine.

2987
03:15:46,877 --> 03:15:49,033
ZAC: Or that spicy fingerblast.

2988
03:15:49,033 --> 03:15:51,687
IFY: I rolled 17 for medicine.

2989
03:15:51,744 --> 03:15:57,176
MATT: 17. Okay. We'll say between the two of you
working together to bring out some material, you

2990
03:15:57,176 --> 03:16:02,130
rip off part of a cloth you had stored in your
bag, you use Thaumaturgy to go ahead and cauterize

2991
03:16:02,130 --> 03:16:05,449
the wound, eventually you stop the bleeding, you
wrap it up, you wait a few moments and he comes to

2992
03:16:05,449 --> 03:16:09,728
slow consciousness, sore, worse for wear, but
alive nevertheless.

2993
03:16:09,728 --> 03:16:11,039
ZAC: You did good.

2994
03:16:11,039 --> 03:16:12,504
IFY: Hey, man.

2995
03:16:12,504 --> 03:16:14,851
DAN: I beat the golem. I did it.

2996
03:16:14,851 --> 03:16:16,642
ZAC: You did all of it, it was all you.

2997
03:16:16,642 --> 03:16:18,547
DAN: I'm going to cough blood.

2998
03:16:18,547 --> 03:16:20,505
MATT: And he does.

2999
03:16:20,505 --> 03:16:27,861
IFY: Just want to get you guys invoiced, that gem
that you guys destroyed was probably worth like

3000
03:16:27,861 --> 03:16:30,401
500 gold, so y'all both are in debt--

3001
03:16:30,401 --> 03:16:32,360
ZAC: You're still getting paid, you're still
getting paid.

3002
03:16:32,360 --> 03:16:34,009
DAN: Classic dwarven accounting.

3003
03:16:34,009 --> 03:16:37,379
ZAC: We'll just go back to the bad father, he'll
give you your money.

3004
03:16:37,379 --> 03:16:40,606
IFY: Yeah, yeah, you totally gave up your share,
so it's between me and Salty.

3005
03:16:40,606 --> 03:16:42,416
ZAC: I remember that.

3006
03:16:42,416 --> 03:16:45,873
MATT: You do notice as you're on the ground,
looking around, suddenly the brackish liquid

3007
03:16:45,873 --> 03:16:52,771
that's surrounded it seems to have lost a lot of
its darker viscous aspect and now it's kind of

3008
03:16:52,771 --> 03:16:55,693
clear, smooth, pure water.

3009
03:16:55,693 --> 03:17:03,310
DAN: I am gonna plunge my mangled paw into that
clear-ass water.

3010
03:17:03,310 --> 03:17:11,324
MATT: It is cold and slightly helpful in soothing
the pain, and you are glad for once since you

3011
03:17:11,324 --> 03:17:14,471
arrived here to see some water that is not
absolutely terrifying.

3012
03:17:14,471 --> 03:17:16,026
DAN: Thank god for that.

3013
03:17:16,026 --> 03:17:17,969
IFY: Yeah, man, we did it.

3014
03:17:17,969 --> 03:17:19,797
DAN: It's good, it's good.

3015
03:17:19,797 --> 03:17:22,579
IFY: So do you want me to pick up your fingers,
or?

3016
03:17:22,579 --> 03:17:24,310
DAN: Yeah, that'd be fucking great.

3017
03:17:24,310 --> 03:17:25,969
IFY: All right, so I put his fingers in my pack.

3018
03:17:25,969 --> 03:17:27,554
DAN: I'm a little shorthanded.

3019
03:17:27,554 --> 03:17:30,357
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

3020
03:17:30,357 --> 03:17:32,913
MARISHA: Finger-scouting mission.

3021
03:17:32,913 --> 03:17:35,017
LIAM: One, two-- where are the other three?

3022
03:17:35,017 --> 03:17:37,422
IFY: Perception-- ten.

3023
03:17:37,422 --> 03:17:44,222
MATT: You find two fingers. God knows where, the
rest are buried either somewhere in the remains of

3024
03:17:44,418 --> 03:17:48,276
the sand creature or somewhere else in the room,
but after a good five minutes of scouting you

3025
03:17:48,276 --> 03:17:50,106
manage to find two of the digits.

3026
03:17:50,106 --> 03:17:52,189
LIAM: He can still rock on, though.

3027
03:17:52,189 --> 03:17:55,538
ORION: That's all you need.

3028
03:17:55,538 --> 03:17:58,642
DAN: It's all I have. Surf's up.

3029
03:17:58,642 --> 03:18:04,376
MATT: As you guys slowly find your way back up to
the top of the pile of sand that led you into this

3030
03:18:04,376 --> 03:18:07,846
chamber, you look up and you can see there's a
small bit of light, and you hear a voice echoing

3031
03:18:07,846 --> 03:18:12,215
through going, "Hello? Hello?"

3032
03:18:12,215 --> 03:18:17,032
ZAC: Yeah, we are down here and all the trouble
seems to be gone.

3033
03:18:17,032 --> 03:18:18,159
MATT: You're alive?

3034
03:18:18,159 --> 03:18:19,224
ZAC: Yeah, well--

3035
03:18:19,224 --> 03:18:20,476
DAN: You could say that.

3036
03:18:20,476 --> 03:18:22,669
ZAC: We're kind of okay.

3037
03:18:22,669 --> 03:18:26,313
MATT: "Okay, hold on!" And eventually over a few
minutes you see a small rope being let down.

3038
03:18:26,313 --> 03:18:28,050
IFY: Oh, that's what I like to see.

3039
03:18:28,050 --> 03:18:29,223
MATT: One by one they pull you up.

3040
03:18:29,223 --> 03:18:30,966
ZAC: You know, I do like those ropes.

3041
03:18:30,966 --> 03:18:34,362
MATT: One by one they pull you back up through the
surface. You find yourselves at the center of the

3042
03:18:34,362 --> 03:18:37,657
town, and everyone's gathered around with what
seems to be a slightly more positive demeanor to

3043
03:18:37,657 --> 03:18:42,790
them. As you guys all get up there, Lily runs up
and gives you all an immediate hug and says,

3044
03:18:42,790 --> 03:18:49,132
"Thank you. I felt it lift. I felt the darkness in
my mind disappear. Whatever you did, it worked,

3045
03:18:49,132 --> 03:18:50,799
"you've lifted the curse."

3046
03:18:50,799 --> 03:18:57,238
ZAC: Please, please, please, don't shower us with
all of your riches and food and foul women--

3047
03:18:57,238 --> 03:18:59,299
IFY: This guy's delirious, we're fighting on
gold--

3048
03:18:59,299 --> 03:19:03,975
ZAC: If you must, if you must throw all of those
things at us as some sort of reward for the good

3049
03:19:03,975 --> 03:19:06,994
deed we have just done, that would be wonderful
and great.

3050
03:19:06,994 --> 03:19:09,617
MATT: All of them kind of look at each other, and
you can see there are a few people now stepped out

3051
03:19:09,617 --> 03:19:14,789
of the tents, some of them almost lepers in the
way that they're bandaged, just going, uh, and the

3052
03:19:14,789 --> 03:19:20,836
old woman goes, "We haven't much in the way of
food, but we've pooled our resources." And she

3053
03:19:20,836 --> 03:19:25,522
looks to the halfling male, apparently the father
figure to Lily, who says, "A promise is a

3054
03:19:25,522 --> 03:19:30,351
"promise." And he reaches back and he pulls out a
pouch. You can see it's hefty, full of coins. And

3055
03:19:30,351 --> 03:19:33,428
looks to who to plop it to immediately.

3056
03:19:33,428 --> 03:19:35,792
IFY: It's over here. He gave it away in the
battle.

3057
03:19:35,792 --> 03:19:37,782
ZAC: He's not gonna catch it. He's not gonna catch
it.

3058
03:19:37,782 --> 03:19:40,215
DAN: Oh yeah, great, make fun of the cripple.

3059
03:19:40,215 --> 03:19:45,194
IFY: Yeah, all right. You know, Lily, I just wanna
say, I really liked these moments we shared

3060
03:19:45,194 --> 03:19:51,978
together. I think that we make a good team, and
I'd love for you to continue on this adventure

3061
03:19:51,978 --> 03:19:54,790
with us so we can get to know each other.

3062
03:19:54,790 --> 03:19:56,468
DAN: The sandstones on this one.

3063
03:19:56,468 --> 03:19:59,573
IFY: You know, it's like, you know, it's like an
adventure date.

3064
03:19:59,685 --> 03:20:04,540
MATT: Make a persuasion roll against her father.

3065
03:20:04,540 --> 03:20:09,981
IFY: Nine.

3066
03:20:09,981 --> 03:20:15,808
MATT: She looks at you at you with a smile, looks
at her father who goes--

3067
03:20:18,098 --> 03:20:21,513
IFY: No, man, I saved your town.

3068
03:20:21,710 --> 03:20:23,551
MATT: "And you've been paid for it."

3069
03:20:23,551 --> 03:20:24,695
IFY: All right, all right.

3070
03:20:24,695 --> 03:20:29,194
DAN: What about this? We want the crone with the
violin.

3071
03:20:29,194 --> 03:20:36,199
MATT: She looks ecstatic at the prospect that
somebody even noticed her playing, goes, "Can I?

3072
03:20:36,199 --> 03:20:43,080
"Can I?" Looks back at her and goes, "Certainly."
"Great, I'll get my stuff!"

3073
03:20:43,080 --> 03:20:44,306
ZAC: Are you sure?

3074
03:20:44,306 --> 03:20:48,207
DAN: I love music. Play something baroque.

3075
03:20:48,207 --> 03:20:51,710
MATT: She grabs in her tent and pulls out a small
sack, throws it over her shoulder. With the other

3076
03:20:51,710 --> 03:20:56,110
hand she pulls out this tiny, crappy-ass violin
that looks like it's seen better days on the road,

3077
03:20:56,110 --> 03:21:01,845
and begins to play against the side of her
shoulder this withering 'eeeeeee'.

3078
03:21:01,845 --> 03:21:04,394
ZAC: Great, we now have the saddest fucking
traveling group of misfits I've

3079
03:21:04,394 --> 03:21:05,989
ever seen in my life.

3080
03:21:05,989 --> 03:21:09,081
IFY: Hey, let the dude with the nubs have his, you
know--

3081
03:21:09,081 --> 03:21:11,163
ZAC: Yeah, you got all the money, you handle the
money.

3082
03:21:11,163 --> 03:21:12,483
DAN: Classic dwarf dabs.

3083
03:21:12,483 --> 03:21:14,220
ZAC: He's without fingers, I've got nothing out of
this.

3084
03:21:14,220 --> 03:21:18,078
DAN: I've got seven. Lucky number.

3085
03:21:18,078 --> 03:21:24,277
MATT: And with that, the legend of these
journeymen continues forward into the annals of

3086
03:21:24,277 --> 03:21:25,794
history. Well-played, guys.

3087
03:21:25,794 --> 03:21:34,027
(cheering)

3088
03:21:34,027 --> 03:21:37,145
MATT: So what is the name of your party? What is
the title of your traveling band?

3089
03:21:37,145 --> 03:21:40,678
MARISHA: What is it? Party title, party title.

3090
03:21:40,678 --> 03:21:43,976
ZAC: Nub 'n' butters.

3091
03:21:43,976 --> 03:21:46,073
DAN: Nub 'n' butters?

3092
03:21:46,073 --> 03:21:49,072
ZAC: It seems like something this guy would say.

3093
03:21:49,072 --> 03:21:51,168
IFY: The good, the rad, and the nubbly.

3094
03:21:51,168 --> 03:21:52,727
ZAC AND DAN: The good, the rad, and the nubbly.

3095
03:21:52,727 --> 03:21:54,102
MATT: The good, the rad, and the nubbly? I like
that.

3096
03:21:54,102 --> 03:21:55,136
MARISHA: All about that.

3097
03:21:55,136 --> 03:21:58,581
MATT: All right, you've seen and enjoyed the
adventure of the good, the bad-- the good, the

3098
03:21:58,581 --> 03:22:02,492
rad, and the nubbly. Completely improvised
roleplaying experience.

3099
03:22:02,492 --> 03:22:03,740
ZAC: I'm the good.

3100
03:22:03,740 --> 03:22:06,241
MATT: Well done, guys, that was awesome, that was
fun to watch.

3101
03:22:06,241 --> 03:22:11,406
ZAC: Thank you, Matt, that was a lot of fun. This
was my first roleplaying experience ever.

3102
03:22:11,406 --> 03:22:12,777
TALIESIN: It was so good!

3103
03:22:12,777 --> 03:22:14,540
ZAC: Never done one before.

3104
03:22:14,540 --> 03:22:15,907
MARISHA: You looked so happy.

3105
03:22:15,907 --> 03:22:20,695
ZAC: This is fun. It's a lot of fun. I didn't have
friends growing up, so I never got to play this.

3106
03:22:20,695 --> 03:22:21,818
IFY: Should've went to those--

3107
03:22:21,818 --> 03:22:24,599
ZAC: No, there weren't enough people, I lived in
the woods.

3108
03:22:24,599 --> 03:22:29,838
IFY: No, see, what I did is I went to the Gaia
forums, if you went to the Go Gaia forums--

3109
03:22:29,838 --> 03:22:33,035
DAN: Gaia? That little anime avatar? Super sick.

3110
03:22:33,035 --> 03:22:35,621
ZAC: We didn't have internet. I didn't know these
things existed.

3111
03:22:35,621 --> 03:22:37,846
MARISHA: I was the same way, I feel your pain.

3112
03:22:37,846 --> 03:22:41,354
LIAM: Classic tale of childhood innovation.

3113
03:22:41,354 --> 03:22:44,653
DAN: That's so sad.

3114
03:22:44,715 --> 03:22:49,012
ORION: That's gonna have to be integrated 
somehow.

3115
03:22:49,059 --> 03:22:57,605
ZAC: All I hope is that the fans of Critical Role
got some enjoyment out of that and that we get

3116
03:22:57,689 --> 03:23:01,209
even an inkling of the fanart that you guys get
when you do your show.

3117
03:23:01,234 --> 03:23:02,267
MATT: Oh, I'm sure.

3118
03:23:02,267 --> 03:23:03,959
LIAM: Please, please, something!

3119
03:23:03,959 --> 03:23:07,454
MARISHA: I really wanna see Salty Pete with his
cape.

3120
03:23:07,454 --> 03:23:09,968
ZAC: Yeah, we didn't really get a good description
of what you look like.

3121
03:23:09,968 --> 03:23:16,551
IFY: Oh, basically, you know, I look like a dark
iron orc, which is like a grayish stone skin, I've

3122
03:23:16,551 --> 03:23:18,815
got a Kimbo Slice beard going on.

3123
03:23:18,815 --> 03:23:20,967
DAN: Hell yes!

3124
03:23:20,967 --> 03:23:31,346
IFY: I have an iron chain around my neck at all
times over my chainmail and I got a stein with

3125
03:23:31,346 --> 03:23:33,402
brass knuckles as the handle.

3126
03:23:33,402 --> 03:23:35,667
(laughter)

3127
03:23:35,667 --> 03:23:39,876
IFY: And I always wear my gold sack just out.

3128
03:23:39,876 --> 03:23:41,612
DAN: Flaunt it.

3129
03:23:41,612 --> 03:23:44,048
IFY: So people know how much money I'm rocking
with.

3130
03:23:44,048 --> 03:23:53,073
ZAC: I basically look exactly like a tiefling
wearing a unicorn onesie for no apparent reason

3131
03:23:53,073 --> 03:23:57,720
whatsoever. I did cut a nice little tail-slot out
the back, though.

3132
03:23:57,720 --> 03:24:02,002
MATT: Good. That wasn't confusing at all for the
horse you've been riding this whole time.

3133
03:24:02,002 --> 03:24:05,024
ZAC: Well, that horse has seen better days now.

3134
03:24:05,024 --> 03:24:06,258
MATT: Yeah.

3135
03:24:06,258 --> 03:24:07,866
MARISHA: What do you look like, Salty Pete?

3136
03:24:07,866 --> 03:24:13,181
DAN: Well, Salty Pete strikes an imposing figure,
he cuts a mean swath. Basically he's wearing a

3137
03:24:13,181 --> 03:24:18,727
battered leather jerkin, some rich woolen pants to
get him through those salty nights on the open

3138
03:24:18,727 --> 03:24:23,700
seas. He also has a velvet doublet because you've
gotta treat yourself right every now and then, and

3139
03:24:23,700 --> 03:24:28,862
of course he's never seen without his signature
black cape, which was once upon a time the flag

3140
03:24:28,862 --> 03:24:34,622
flying high above the masts on the Obsidian Helen,
the ship that he lusted after. He also has a

3141
03:24:34,622 --> 03:24:42,762
grizzled gray beard, not Kimbo Slice-esque, more
like Ser Davos Seaworthean in stature and size.

3142
03:24:42,762 --> 03:24:43,679
MARISHA: Nice.

3143
03:24:43,679 --> 03:24:44,558
MATT: Fantastic.

3144
03:24:44,558 --> 03:24:49,628
ZAC: We basically look like the most hilarious gay
bar troupe you could ever see.

3145
03:24:49,628 --> 03:24:51,764
(laughter)

3146
03:24:51,764 --> 03:24:53,974
ZAC: Straight out of central San Francisco.

3147
03:24:53,974 --> 03:24:55,626
MATT: I would party so hard with you guys.

3148
03:24:55,626 --> 03:24:57,238
ZAC: I've got these two on metal chains.

3149
03:24:57,238 --> 03:24:58,619
DAN: Well, I'm a polar bear.

3150
03:24:58,619 --> 03:25:00,827
MARISHA: (laughs) Metal chains. I've seen that at
anime conventions.

3151
03:25:00,827 --> 03:25:02,444
MATT: Get on it, artists.

3152
03:25:02,444 --> 03:25:04,358
ZAC: I'm pretty sure in West Hollywood I've seen
somebody walking down the street

3153
03:25:04,358 --> 03:25:05,641
in this exact getup.

3154
03:25:05,641 --> 03:25:10,702
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure I have. So here's my
question. 'Cause was this your first time playing

3155
03:25:10,702 --> 03:25:11,717
D&D too, Dan?

3156
03:25:11,717 --> 03:25:12,414
DAN: No.

3157
03:25:12,414 --> 03:25:13,752
LIAM: No, hell no, you can tell.

3158
03:25:13,752 --> 03:25:15,091
MARISHA: But this was your first time.

3159
03:25:15,091 --> 03:25:16,929
ZAC: I've never done this, this was great.

3160
03:25:16,929 --> 03:25:22,101
MARISHA: Did you feel like it was intimidating,
the roleplaying aspect of it at first, and how--

3161
03:25:22,101 --> 03:25:25,172
did you feel any awkwardness easing into it?

3162
03:25:25,172 --> 03:25:30,845
ZAC: Well, we are on the internet in front of a
lot of people that are silently judging me. There

3163
03:25:30,845 --> 03:25:35,301
is that small factor. Also, there's usually the
people sitting here that are fucking

3164
03:25:35,301 --> 03:25:43,308
professionals, so there is a slight bar that's
really, really high, like, a little intimidation

3165
03:25:43,308 --> 03:25:50,710
there. The roleplaying part's really fun. What I'm
intimidated by is just, this is a lot of stuff,

3166
03:25:50,710 --> 03:25:54,620
this is a lot of information and it's a lot to
learn, I'm excited to learn, and I want to know

3167
03:25:54,620 --> 03:25:59,613
what all this stuff is, because I don't want to
feel like a dumdum, and I feel kinda like a

3168
03:25:59,613 --> 03:26:04,171
dumdum. But this is great, this is so much fun.
But yeah, a little intimidated by how vast the

3169
03:26:04,171 --> 03:26:06,131
knowledge is that's incorporated into this.

3170
03:26:06,131 --> 03:26:08,777
MATT: Yeah, it's a lot to throw you at once. You
did really good with what was thrown at you.

3171
03:26:08,777 --> 03:26:13,321
TALIESIN: It does start to feel smaller. It does
eventually start to feel, it's like learning how

3172
03:26:13,321 --> 03:26:16,376
to juggle, you're like, ahh, and then suddenly it's
like, okay.

3173
03:26:16,576 --> 03:26:21,251
DAN: Once you learn the basic math, it's basically
just applying that to every situation, and once

3174
03:26:21,251 --> 03:26:26,248
you get that down, it's just a matter of getting
into the minutiae. And that's something that took me

3175
03:26:26,248 --> 03:26:28,391
a while, 'cause math was not my strong suit--

3176
03:26:28,548 --> 03:26:29,411
ZAC: Oh no.

3177
03:26:29,411 --> 03:26:31,382
DAN: Unless it's the number one, which I'll roll
all day everyday.

3178
03:26:31,382 --> 03:26:33,238
ZAC: Yeah, you were throwing number ones, man.

3179
03:26:33,238 --> 03:26:39,056
DAN: I thought it was golf. No, once you learn
that basic system, it's really cool, because you

3180
03:26:39,056 --> 03:26:44,807
can extrapolate from that and apply it to every
situation.

3181
03:26:44,807 --> 03:26:45,650
ZAC: Nah.

3182
03:26:45,650 --> 03:26:47,001
IFY: What?

3183
03:26:47,001 --> 03:26:48,612
DAN: I mean, that's literally how it works.

3184
03:26:48,612 --> 03:26:54,404
ZAC: I was gonna say we could elaborate on Ify's
D&D experiences, but I'd prefer to not travel down

3185
03:26:54,404 --> 03:26:55,550
that trail.

3186
03:26:55,550 --> 03:27:02,523
IFY: Nah, I've been in a few groups. I'm currently
in a UCB group, and I usually tend to play, I'm

3187
03:27:02,523 --> 03:27:06,696
the guy who starts the fights all the time.

3188
03:27:06,696 --> 03:27:08,177
MATT: I had a feeling.

3189
03:27:08,177 --> 03:27:11,259
ZAC: Hector was in your group, and you guys killed
him off, right?

3190
03:27:11,259 --> 03:27:19,365
IFY: That was actually Dale, it wasn't Darren,
he's our only cleric and the one fight, the DM

3191
03:27:19,365 --> 03:27:27,747
told me that, like, the fight initiated, monster
went for Hector, critical hit, dead one shot, at

3192
03:27:27,747 --> 03:27:29,606
the beginning of the encounter.

3193
03:27:29,606 --> 03:27:32,324
DAN: Brutal, brutal.

3194
03:27:32,324 --> 03:27:40,907
IFY: And so the guys that I play with decided,
because Hector missed a few, so, we'll just

3195
03:27:40,907 --> 03:27:47,727
resurrect him when he comes back. And so we were
playing last Sunday, and I was like, oh, what

3196
03:27:47,727 --> 03:27:52,564
about Hector? And he goes, yeah, how long until we
have to resurrect him? He goes, oh, it's about ten

3197
03:27:52,564 --> 03:27:58,251
days. And I was like, how long has it been? He's
like, in the game, it's been about a month. So his

3198
03:27:58,251 --> 03:28:00,193
corpse is rotting.

3199
03:28:00,193 --> 03:28:08,105
MATT: Should've put that in my iCalendar. Oh
well.

3200
03:28:08,105 --> 03:28:14,006
MARISHA: Oh, we missed that resurrection
appointment. Reschedule.

3201
03:28:14,006 --> 03:28:20,739
ZAC: Can I take one small moment to say, I saw we
were at 3,170 subs, 30 more, we'll do another

3202
03:28:20,739 --> 03:28:26,203
giveaway of a book and a picture. It will take us
a little bit to get the books, though, guys,

3203
03:28:26,203 --> 03:28:32,379
because I'm pretty sure you guys had something to
do with this, but in the last two weeks, all the

3204
03:28:32,379 --> 03:28:40,703
D&D handbooks on Amazon have been out of stock.
And they weren't a month ago. We keep trying to

3205
03:28:40,703 --> 03:28:44,049
add them to our wishlist to get more, and they're
just out of stock. So we're working on getting

3206
03:28:44,049 --> 03:28:49,567
some more so we can do them for giveaways and
stuff, but when we get to 3,200, we'll give away

3207
03:28:49,567 --> 03:28:53,378
some more. So sub if you can, it supports all of
us.

3208
03:28:53,378 --> 03:28:59,409
MATT: Thank you guys so much for watching. Any
last comments you want to make before we sign

3209
03:28:59,409 --> 03:29:00,214
off?

3210
03:29:00,214 --> 03:29:02,281
ZAC: Thank you, coaches.

3211
03:29:02,281 --> 03:29:04,322
LIAM: I would love it if, what was your name
again?

3212
03:29:04,322 --> 03:29:05,358
DAN: Who, me?

3213
03:29:05,358 --> 03:29:07,842
LIAM: No, the group, the group.

3214
03:29:07,842 --> 03:29:10,525
MATT, DAN, AND IFY: The good, the rad, and the
nubbly.

3215
03:29:10,525 --> 03:29:11,508
LIAM: The good, the bad, and the nubbly.

3216
03:29:11,508 --> 03:29:12,861
ZAC: The good, the rad, and the nubbly.

3217
03:29:12,861 --> 03:29:18,000
LIAM: The good, the rad, and the nubbly could come
back somehow and intersect with us.

3218
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:20,176
DAN: A multiverse.

3219
03:29:20,176 --> 03:29:25,603
ZAC: If we cross your path, run away, just run the
fuck away, all right?

3220
03:29:25,603 --> 03:29:31,686
MARISHA: Oh shit, it's the good, the rad, and the
nubbly. Run! Run! They're the fuckups of Emon.

3221
03:29:31,686 --> 03:29:35,976
ZAC: You'll see us coming from a hill a long way
away, the guy on the horse with the two dwarves on

3222
03:29:35,976 --> 03:29:37,800
chains and leather behind him.

3223
03:29:37,861 --> 03:29:42,072
MARISHA: You're just that adventuring party where
whenever you roll into town we're just like,

3224
03:29:42,072 --> 03:29:42,984
(sighs heavily)

3225
03:29:42,984 --> 03:29:45,764
TALIESIN: It's like the Blue Beetle and Booster
Gold of the Critical Role--

3226
03:29:45,764 --> 03:29:48,443
DAN: Classic skates.

3227
03:29:48,443 --> 03:29:51,002
TALIESIN: Thank you, thank you.

3228
03:29:51,002 --> 03:29:55,641
ORION: And I'd like to say to everybody who's
watching that had those questions about how do you

3229
03:29:55,641 --> 03:30:00,341
roleplay, how do you have fun, you just saw three
dudes with different levels of experience having

3230
03:30:00,493 --> 03:30:04,356
all an amazing time. And we loved every second of
watching it, so.

3231
03:30:04,356 --> 03:30:06,021
TALIESIN: Doing something totally different than
what we do.

3232
03:30:06,021 --> 03:30:12,858
ORION: No game has to be the same, you play it how
you want, and that's a good time.

3233
03:30:12,858 --> 03:30:16,190
MARISHA: I actually had someone tweeting at me
being like, you know, talking about us mentioning

3234
03:30:16,390 --> 03:30:20,665
how you shouldn't be intimidated by roleplaying,
they said yes, but, conversely, not everyone's an

3235
03:30:20,665 --> 03:30:25,482
actor. And I just want to address that, like,
roleplaying has nothing to do with acting.

3236
03:30:25,482 --> 03:30:28,687
ZAC: I am not an actor. Not an actor.

3237
03:30:28,687 --> 03:30:33,287
MARISHA: Roleplaying isn't about acting, it's
about playing pretend. It's about make-believe.

3238
03:30:33,287 --> 03:30:40,820
With emphasis on "playing". So just play. It's not
about coming up with a character and a motivation

3239
03:30:40,820 --> 03:30:43,550
and any of that. It's just about playing.

3240
03:30:43,550 --> 03:30:44,649
ORION: Or that money.

3241
03:30:44,649 --> 03:30:45,548
MARISHA: Or that money.

3242
03:30:45,548 --> 03:30:47,184
IFY: It's about the damn money, baby.

3243
03:30:47,184 --> 03:30:51,624
ZAC: Sometimes motivations are easy to come 
by, just tap that different part of yourself--

3244
03:30:51,684 --> 03:30:54,423
IFY: Throw them gold pieces on the table. Throw
them gold pieces on the table.

3245
03:30:54,423 --> 03:30:58,539
ZAC: There's a character inside each of you guys,
just tap into that inner Ify and just put it out

3246
03:30:58,539 --> 03:31:00,580
on the table.

3247
03:31:00,580 --> 03:31:05,722
MARISHA: As sarcastic as Zac is being, it's
totally true.

3248
03:31:05,722 --> 03:31:06,966
ORION: It's true, it is.

3249
03:31:06,966 --> 03:31:10,813
MARISHA: It's totally true, like, if you guys
notice, they made their characters while Matt was

3250
03:31:10,813 --> 03:31:15,281
talking about DMing, and then they had fully
fleshed-out characters by the time they started

3251
03:31:15,281 --> 03:31:20,854
playing, and mainly that's because they just had a
few solid ideas, and then their characters built

3252
03:31:20,854 --> 03:31:24,692
as the story unfolded. And that was great. That
was awesome.

3253
03:31:24,692 --> 03:31:29,005
MATT: And like I said earlier, if you are still
intimidated, don't worry, you don't have to come

3254
03:31:29,005 --> 03:31:33,177
out of the gate being completely open to it. Just
find your way in, play as comfortable as you are,

3255
03:31:33,177 --> 03:31:37,516
and work towards getting to that point where
you're able to talk as that character, and just

3256
03:31:37,516 --> 03:31:42,059
notify the rest of the party and your DM that
you're working on it. And let them be respectful,

3257
03:31:42,059 --> 03:31:46,201
and eventually you'll find your way comfortable to
talk like it, if that's what you want. Some games

3258
03:31:46,201 --> 03:31:50,052
just wanna be, you know, Diablo-style
dungeon-crawlers, kill shit, get loot, and that's

3259
03:31:50,052 --> 03:31:51,638
totally fine too.

3260
03:31:51,638 --> 03:31:56,882
MARISHA: And seriously, if anyone judges you
because of your roleplaying, fuck them, they

3261
03:31:56,882 --> 03:31:58,107
shouldn't be in your game anymore.

3262
03:31:58,107 --> 03:31:59,593
DAN: Sneak attack. They won't expect it.

3263
03:31:59,593 --> 03:32:01,074
ZAC: Sneaky Pete 'em!

3264
03:32:01,074 --> 03:32:02,342
MATT: 5d6!

3265
03:32:02,342 --> 03:32:03,693
ZAC: Sneaky Pete 'em right in the face.

3266
03:32:03,693 --> 03:32:08,221
LIAM: Just be willing to be stupid, because that's
half the fun.

3267
03:32:08,221 --> 03:32:09,743
DAN: Friendly fire is on.

3268
03:32:09,743 --> 03:32:13,649
IFY: I'm a big proponent of friendly fire.

3269
03:32:13,649 --> 03:32:17,861
DAN: Oh, Zac, do you like friendly fire?

3270
03:32:17,861 --> 03:32:27,096
IFY: Basically, quick story, last Sunday in our
group we kidnapped a guy 'cause we were

3271
03:32:27,096 --> 03:32:32,527
questioning him, and he just never was intimidated
by me because early in the game I tried to bluff

3272
03:32:32,527 --> 03:32:37,695
check to try and get him to give me 200 gold for
no reason, and rolled a one, and so we had him,

3273
03:32:37,695 --> 03:32:45,865
and so Dead Strongjaw is a barbarian, huge
barbarian, like I rolled hot that night, I had 21

3274
03:32:45,865 --> 03:32:55,074
strength, so I tried to punch him to knock him out
'cause he started screaming for help, we ran

3275
03:32:55,074 --> 03:33:02,223
inside his apartment, and I broke his jaw and we
dragged him into a nearby cave and--

3276
03:33:02,223 --> 03:33:04,590
MARISHA: Where is this going?

3277
03:33:04,590 --> 03:33:05,962
IFY: -- so the whole time--

3278
03:33:05,962 --> 03:33:07,737
DAN: That man was Kanye West, through the wire.

3279
03:33:07,737 --> 03:33:18,720
IFY: So through that, our, we had this warlock or
wizard who summoned this infernal mastiff to ride,

3280
03:33:18,720 --> 03:33:25,721
and he was talking all this shit, so I rolled and
punched his mastiff, and since it was a spell, I

3281
03:33:25,721 --> 03:33:35,313
punched it out of existence, and that's when the
archivist came to, and he was like, he just sees

3282
03:33:35,313 --> 03:33:40,453
me punch it, and I kept saying we are good people,
because I realized that I'm neutral good, so I

3283
03:33:40,453 --> 03:33:50,201
didn't want to torture him. And then that's when
the DM was like, just so you know, he came to, you

3284
03:33:50,201 --> 03:33:55,192
punched a devilish mastiff out of existence, and
yelled, "We're good people!"

3285
03:33:55,192 --> 03:33:58,135
over and over to him.

3286
03:33:58,135 --> 03:34:06,505
MATT: That's a way to get it across. That's the
kind of shit that happens, yeah. Well guys, thank

3287
03:34:06,505 --> 03:34:10,928
you so much for watching. I hope it's been
semi-informative, at the very least fun to watch.

3288
03:34:10,928 --> 03:34:15,940
We'll definitely be up next week for the
continuation of the Critical Role storyline,

3289
03:34:15,940 --> 03:34:21,114
picking up where K'Varn was defeated in the depths
of the Temple of Yug'voril, the Illithid city deep

3290
03:34:21,114 --> 03:34:24,126
beneath Kraghammer and see where the party goes
from there.

3291
03:34:24,126 --> 03:34:25,898
ZAC: Yay, I'm excited!

3292
03:34:25,898 --> 03:34:27,149
(cheering)

3293
03:34:27,149 --> 03:34:31,674
MATT: A big round of applause for our coaches and
hanging out here tonight, big round of applause--

3294
03:34:31,674 --> 03:34:32,748
ZAC: Happy birthday, Liam!

3295
03:34:32,748 --> 03:34:34,181
ALL: Happy birthday, Liam!

3296
03:34:34,181 --> 03:34:35,268
ORION: Where's your cake?

3297
03:34:35,268 --> 03:34:36,687
MARISHA: Where is your cake?

3298
03:34:36,687 --> 03:34:37,497
LIAM: I dunno.

3299
03:34:37,497 --> 03:34:42,319
ZAC: We had a cake for Liam. We gotta sing happy
birthday. We have to sing happy birthday

3300
03:34:42,319 --> 03:34:43,342
with the cake!

3301
03:34:43,342 --> 03:34:45,465
MARISHA: The non-licensed happy birthday, at
least.

3302
03:34:45,465 --> 03:34:47,795
ZAC: Oh, fuck it, we're gonna sing the licensed
one, what are they gonna do?

3303
03:34:47,795 --> 03:34:48,815
MARISHA: Yeah, fuck you, Twitch!

3304
03:34:48,815 --> 03:34:51,032
ZAC: Do you really think that we're so on key
that--

3305
03:34:51,032 --> 03:34:53,436
DAN: Winston Birthday is gonna sue us. Please.

3306
03:34:53,436 --> 03:34:55,343
MARISHA: (laughs) Winston Birthday.

3307
03:34:55,343 --> 03:35:08,698
ZAC: Oh my gosh. We also have shirts for sale,
guys! It's so hard.

3308
03:35:08,698 --> 03:35:10,237
DAN: That was an amazing segue.

3309
03:35:10,237 --> 03:35:12,752
ORION: That was very Paul Blart, dude.

3310
03:35:12,752 --> 03:35:16,869
TALIESIN: No, no.

3311
03:35:16,869 --> 03:35:19,605
ZAC: My brain never stops thinking about how in
the world we're gonna make this thing survive

3312
03:35:19,605 --> 03:35:27,408
forever. Gotta get those subs and sell those
shirts. By the way, guys, omgsteve from Team

3313
03:35:27,408 --> 03:35:32,391
Hooman came by today, here's here now, he's been
watching, hope you had a good time. You wanna wave

3314
03:35:32,391 --> 03:35:33,294
hi to everybody?

3315
03:35:33,294 --> 03:35:34,804
MATT: Yeah, come on, say hello!

3316
03:35:34,804 --> 03:35:38,948
ZAC: Come around back and say hello. Omgsteve is a
great member of our community for Team Hooman, we

3317
03:35:38,948 --> 03:35:40,392
have the best community--

3318
03:35:40,392 --> 03:35:43,760
(cheering)

3319
03:35:43,760 --> 03:35:51,027
ZAC: He brought Liam cake and tasty treats, like,
thank you so much.

3320
03:35:51,027 --> 03:35:56,044
ORION: Oh, you're responsible for the potato
balls! Yes!

3321
03:35:56,103 --> 03:35:57,932
TALIESIN: Oh, thank, oh it was amazing.

3322
03:35:57,932 --> 03:36:00,316
MATT: You saved my ass. I didn't have enough time
to get lunch today, and I came in and you'd

3323
03:36:00,316 --> 03:36:02,341
brought all that, I was like, ahh, thank you.

3324
03:36:02,341 --> 03:36:04,314
TALIESIN: We were waiting in line for potato balls
and--

3325
03:36:04,314 --> 03:36:05,818
MARISHA: And we had to leave.

3326
03:36:05,818 --> 03:36:08,825
TALIESIN: -- and then we got here and there were
potato balls.

3327
03:36:08,825 --> 03:36:10,913
MARISHA: I locked my keys in the car.

3328
03:36:10,913 --> 03:36:24,337
ALL: (sing) Happy birthday to you, happy
