00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:06,426
Oh, hello there! I'm Taryon Darrington of the Slayer's Cake.

2
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:07,949
The Slayer's Cake: your pals

3
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:09,875
in a pastry pinch.

4
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:11,656
Go now? Okay.

5
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:12,400
[clears throat]

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,802
Heading to a fancy banquet and not sure if
your hosts are undead?

7
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:18,905
Ooh! Slayer's Cake.

8
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:22,629
Say it's Winter's Crest and you don't know
what to get your Secret Sarenrae.

9
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,900
Possibly because you've never given a gift before!

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,739
It could happen.

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,913
Slayer's Cake!

12
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:31,146
We even have miniature cakes for that
special gnome-one in your life.

13
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:33,454
VEX: [offscreen] Those are cupcakes, Tary!

14
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:35,322
Okay, well, I mean.

15
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:36,347
Mmm!

16
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:41,169
But hey! If I still haven't convinced you,
don't take my word for it.

17
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:51,402
Are we still--

18
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,979
Mmm! Delicious.

19
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:04,715
[awkwardly] Wow, so light.

20
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:06,582
And I would know, I'm a cleric.

21
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:08,460
Er...

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:08,928
...what?

23
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:14,325
So come on down to the Slayer's Cake located
in downtown Whitestone!

24
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,706
Look for the big unsanitary bear.

25
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:17,738
You can't miss it!

26
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:21,372
And don't forget: don't step in bear shit!

27
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,677
KEYLETH: [offscreen] Bumper VO.

28
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:26,091
The Slayer's Cake. Open 'till 6 p.m., 7 on weekends.

29
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:29,084
C-closed Thursdays for adventuring.

30
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:30,868
Slayer's cake aprons available now.

31
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:31,600
[gasps]

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,720
What?! We have aprons? Tary, you didn't tell me we have aprons!

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:44,018
