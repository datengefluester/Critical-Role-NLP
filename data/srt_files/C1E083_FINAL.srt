1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,044
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode 
of Critical Role,

2
00:00:02,056 --> 00:00:05,155
where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors 
and awesome writing guest

3
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:06,777
play Dungeons and Dragons.

4
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:10,066
Before we get into the chaos 
for tonight's episode,

5
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,336
let's go ahead 
and knock through our announcements.

6
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:13,563
First and foremost,

7
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:16,897
tonight's episode is brought to you 
by Magic Puzzle Quest.

8
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:19,206
(all cheer)

9
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:20,700
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,191
MATT: It was written "Magic" on here. 
Marvel Puzzle Quest.

11
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:26,982
SAM: Mazel tov Puzzle Quest.

12
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:30,263
MATT: Yay! Marvel Puzzle Quest, 
our sponsor for tonight.

13
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,519
Sam, you had a few words?

14
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,127
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest is available now 
on Apple and Android devices.

15
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:40,790
The latest update adds Riri Williams, 
a.k.a. Ironheart.

16
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:44,833
You can check it out 
at bit.ly/criticalmpq--

17
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,734
that'll be posted all over the place, 
but I got a chance to play this game,

18
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:52,239
and let me just tell you, 
I'm a pretty good gamer.

19
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:57,100
I just loved being able 
to play this game through.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,828
I tried it on a PS4, I tried it on a PS3,

21
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:06,555
I tried it on Xbox 360, 
because I'm a 1337 gamer.

22
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:11,135
I tried it on Steam Engine, 
because that's how you get games,

23
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,017
and it was amazing.

24
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:17,467
You can play as all your favorite
Marvel characters, like the Avengers.

25
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:21,957
The Avengers include characters 
like Elrond Man, Nick Furry,

26
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:25,017
Red White and Blue Shield Guy, 
the Hulch,

27
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:31,070
and there's other characters 
like Lord Star, Dice Man, Carnage,

28
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,949
Aunt Man, Professor Triple X,

29
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:36,797
and the Medical Team;
that's what I call these characters

30
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,922
called Dr. Doom, Dr. Strange, 
and Dr. Octopus;

31
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:42,870
they're all medical doctors 
and they all fight for good.

32
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:48,190
There's Kamala Chaka Khan, 
there's Juggs or Not--

33
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:53,480
(all laugh)

34
00:01:53,523 --> 00:02:07,229
SAM: You can play as the Human Porch, 
he just relaxes. Nic Cage.

35
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:12,230
One of my favorite X-Men 
is Jennifer Grey, from Dirty Dancing.

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,803
There's Rocket and Poot

37
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,093
and everybody's favorite 
Canadian tough-guy,

38
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:23,561
Walford Rains. Snicket!

39
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:27,971
Yeah. And you solve puzzles 
and it's really addictive.

40
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:30,011
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

41
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:32,200
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Jugs or Not.

42
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,594
MARISHA: We're like the only show

43
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:37,221
that a sponsor's going to let us 
get away with botching their product.

44
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,556
SAM: That's the names! 
You haven't played like I have.

45
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,054
That's the names of the characters, 
I'm pretty sure.

46
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:46,488
PATRICK: I love the team 
of Professor Triple X and Dr. Strange.

47
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:50,649
SAM: They all have PhDs. It makes sense.

48
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:52,255
TALIESIN: They're pronounced 
Centennials, actually.

49
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:56,506
MARISHA: I don't like millennials. 
I'm a Centennial.

50
00:02:56,506 --> 00:03:00,834
MATT: Thank you very much, 
not Magic, but Marvel Puzzle Quest,

51
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:04,364
for being our awesome sponsor tonight. 
Check out their stuff.

52
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:09,469
All right, also, Marisha, do you 
want to talk a bit about the promo code?

53
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:13,017
MARISHA: If you watched Talks Machina 
this week on Tuesday night,

54
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:18,209
you saw that we gave away a promo code, 
hashtag-- no, no hashtags.

55
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,988
It's just a code. Just the code "TALKS."

56
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:24,058
Like if you're talking, 
like I'm doing right now.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,739
"TALKS" as in Talks Machina,

58
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:28,997
and that gives you 30 days 
free trial on Alpha,

59
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:32,266
so if you're a good gamer like Sam is--

60
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,778
SAM: I'm 1337.

61
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,288
MARISHA: You know 
that those things stack,

62
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:43,723
so you can use your free subscription 
from Amazon Prime,

63
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:50,204
and then use another 30 days, 
and then it's only 30 more days

64
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:54,614
before your checks expire 
and then they're not good anymore.

65
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:58,444
SAM: Is this like a Columbia House thing 
where you keep doing a new subscription?

66
00:03:58,454 --> 00:03:59,551
LIAM: You're dating us.

67
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:05,923
TALIESIN: I think our audience 
gets the joke. The camera's laughing.

68
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:18,295
MARISHA: Anyway, yes. Promo code "TALKS."

69
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,587
PATRICK: Columbia House 
is where the X-Men used to live.

70
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:25,556
Before it was the mansion, 
it was Columbia House.

71
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,924
MARISHA: Oh! You should also 
go watch Talks Machina, too.

72
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:31,988
MATT: It's our crazy little aftershow.

73
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,636
We have silly discussions, 
answer community questions,

74
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,574
and generally just hang out 
and make fools of ourselves

75
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:37,852
for your entertainment.

76
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,112
MARISHA: It's good fun.

77
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:45,177
LAURA: Along with Brian W. Foster!

78
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:48,000
MATT: Laura, Travis, me, and Marisha 
once again will be guests

79
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:51,593
at Anime Milwaukee next month.

80
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:55,313
We'll be up there Friday through Sunday 
doing panels, signings, all kinds of chaos.

81
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,671
Come see us, come say hi. 
Bring things we'll sign them.

82
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:01,942
Bring questions and we'll answer them. 
Bring handshakes and we'll touch them.

83
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,347
LAURA: What are those dates again?

84
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:06,544
TRAVIS: February 17th through the 19th.

85
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,309
MATT: February 17th through the 19th. Yes.

86
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,412
TRAVIS: Or whatever the dates say.

87
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:16,319
MATT: Sorry, I'm going off what I have. 
And merchandise, Laura.

88
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,671
LAURA: Hey, guess what?

89
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,900
MATT AND TRAVIS: What?

90
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,304
LAURA: There's some merchandise!

91
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:22,303
(all cheer)

92
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,420
LIAM: Can you buy it?

93
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,359
LAURA: You can buy it 
in the shop on Geek and Sundry.

94
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,633
There's nothing new this week,

95
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:30,450
but there's all the stuff 
that I talked about last week,

96
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:34,753
like socks and hoodies 
and hats and bracelets and pens--

97
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:36,575
SAM: Wait, we have socks now?

98
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,054
LAURA: Oh, you missed it!

99
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:38,975
SAM: Socks Machina?

100
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,376
LAURA: Socks Machina!

101
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:42,701
MARISHA: So we have Critical Role socks,

102
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:45,296
which apparently they've done really good, 
we've already sold half,

103
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:51,253
and people are already super excited 
for us to have character-driven socks.

104
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:53,849
TALIESIN: They're really comfy, 
but then I took them off

105
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,807
and my cats found them 
and now they will not give them back.

106
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:57,875
MATT: Don't give them to your cats.

107
00:05:57,877 --> 00:05:59,194
TALIESIN: No, this is really true,

108
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,844
they've taken them 
and they're not giving them back.

109
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:04,969
MATT: For context, Socks Machina 
was a joke of ours over a year ago,

110
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,537
and now it's happening.

111
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:11,591
SAM: It sounds pretty stupid.

112
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,085
TRAVIS: They're really nice, man.

113
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,794
MARISHA: We came up with Socks Machina 
at the same time

114
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:19,969
that we came up with Lox Machina, 
which is our branded smoked salmon.

115
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:25,439
LAURA: That's someday soon, guys. 
I'm hoping for that in the store.

116
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,189
TRAVIS: There'll be Grog socks 
with just tons of holes in them.

117
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:29,251
MATT: Perfect.

118
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:30,892
TRAVIS: Made by me.

119
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,405
LAURA: Gross, really stinky.

120
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:36,638
No, they should look like barbarian boots, 
fur-lined boots since you're--

121
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:37,778
TRAVIS: Not as cool.

122
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:38,832
MARISHA: Oh, with little fur on top?

123
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:42,817
TRAVIS: They're going to smell 
like balsamic vinaigrette or something.

124
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:44,329
SAM: Can mine have garter belts?

125
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,588
LAURA: If you want.

126
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,616
SAM: Thank you.

127
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:49,056
MATT: All righty. And last but not least,

128
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,839
we have International Tabletop Day 
coming up April 29th,

129
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:56,260
where we here are going to be celebrating 
everything tabletop.

130
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,755
We'll have more announcements 
as the week gets closer and closer to it,

131
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,389
but we're excited for it.

132
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,728
A bunch of us, if not all of us, 
are going to be involved in some way or another,

133
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:07,041
and just keep an eye out for announcements 
as they roll out.

134
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,488
So mark it on your calendar. April 29th.

135
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,619
TRAVIS: April 29th.

136
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:13,822
MATT: I think that's it, if anyone 
has anything else they want to announce?

137
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:14,814
LIAM: Oh, I got a quick one.

138
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:17,260
Taliesin and I were playing Ubisoft's game
For Honor this morning

139
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,246
for Nerdist and Geek and Sundry.

140
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:20,162
TALIESIN: And it was fun!

141
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:20,928
LIAM: It was fun.

142
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:21,823
TALIESIN: It was nuts.

143
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:24,158
LIAM: There'll be more of it tomorrow. 
We got a couple of warriors in there.

144
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:27,447
I'm playing the knight. 
The chivalrous knight in that game.

145
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,615
TRAVIS: I play a viking.

146
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:33,280
TALIESIN: No, it's good fun. 
I'm back in tomorrow morning.

147
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,671
Actually, you can see me 
tomorrow morning at 9AM Pacific Time.

148
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:38,734
LIAM: You got a major renfaire boner 
playing that game today.

149
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:45,104
TALIESIN: It's hot. It's pretty hot. It's great. 
I want to collect all the things

150
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:48,745
and basically use it as a play 
on the little Renaissance-era barbie doll.

151
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:52,478
And just paint him 
and put things on and change armors.

152
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,970
TRAVIS: Okay, all right, okay. Jeez.

153
00:07:55,974 --> 00:08:01,895
MATT: PVP Renfaire adventure. For Honor. 
That's awesome, cool.

154
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,728
Anything else? All right.

155
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:12,880
Then let's go ahead and jump 
into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

156
00:08:12,903 --> 00:09:42,932
[INTRO]

157
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:48,021
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. 
So, picking up where we left off

158
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:52,335
from my esteemed panel 
of extremely mature--

159
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:54,826
TRAVIS: No one can hear it, man. 
It doesn't exist.

160
00:09:54,826 --> 00:10:00,714
SAM: (singing) In the morning.

161
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:03,894
MATT: Anyway. 
Bringing us into tonight's episode,

162
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,614
leading up to where we are 
currently in the story:

163
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:11,516
Vox Machina, having spent a period of time
battling with the Chroma Conclave,

164
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:16,897
a collection of evil 
and allied chromatic dragons

165
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:18,673
that terrorized the Tal'Dorei countryside,

166
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:21,991
have acquired artifacts 
called the Vestiges of Divergence.

167
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:26,437
After traversing the planes and locations
to gather allies, they made war

168
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,254
on the current occupying armies 
of Thordak the Cinder King

169
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:32,110
in the center of the capital city of Emon,

170
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:36,162
managed to eke out a victory, 
destroying Thordak,

171
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:41,745
and apparently go into battle 
with a dragon they'd made an alliance with,

172
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:45,390
known as Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, 
a member of the Conclave

173
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,948
with which they had 
a very tenuous agreement to work together.

174
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:53,956
After being nearly killed by Raishan 
as she flew the coop, essentially,

175
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,465
you managed to collect 
the remaining armies of the city,

176
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:58,915
made sure everyone was okay.

177
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:01,865
You ran into an old friend from Westruun, 
Kerrek, who had brought

178
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:06,285
a number of his able-bodied warriors 
with him to aid in this battle.

179
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:10,802
You then made your way to Whitestone 
with Kerrek to ascertain the location

180
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,578
of Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, 
of which apparently she had absconded

181
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:19,914
to what's called the island of Viskon. 
It used to belong to a necromancer

182
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:22,326
and then briefly became the lair 
of Thordak the Cinder King

183
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:29,348
before his original attack on Tal'Dorei 
roughly 16 years ago.

184
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:35,700
You then gathered your weapons, 
your armor, and your reserve strength,

185
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,947
and with a couple of allies

186
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:42,027
traversed through teleportation 
all the way to this island,

187
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:45,264
managed to battle your way 
through a deep dungeon

188
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:49,152
that once this necromancer called home,

189
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,618
going past traps 
and chasms filled with undead,

190
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:56,119
and gravity reversed 
through magical means.

191
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,059
You made your way into a small tunnel 
just past this area

192
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,361
into what seemed to split into two sides.

193
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:06,625
Behind that, what appeared to be 
the necromancer's sanctum,

194
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:11,069
some sort of necrotic laboratory, 
where you discovered there within

195
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:14,295
two of the eggs of Thordak's lair 
that were taken by Raishan,

196
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,692
the corpse of Thordak, 
folded in the corner,

197
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:20,534
and apparently Raishan's 
female human form,

198
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:22,897
currently poring through books

199
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:26,078
and rummaging through 
what currently appears to be

200
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:29,658
the relatively untouched necropolis chamber.

201
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:34,193
So, last we left off, 
the two twins had snuck ahead

202
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:39,271
to take a look and take in 
the information of this vicinity,

203
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:43,219
while the rest of the party 
began to slowly approach from behind.

204
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,665
As the rest of the party 
is coming behind,

205
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:47,367
I would like everybody else 
to make a stealth check, please.

206
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,175
MARISHA: Do we have Pass Without a Trace?

207
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:50,990
LAURA: Yes. No.

208
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,835
MATT: I don't believe you cast it. Did you?

209
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:55,804
TALIESIN: Ages ago.

210
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,527
LIAM: Yeah, ages ago. 
I just don't know how long it lasts.

211
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,488
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's been a while.

212
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,213
MATT: You've lost concentration 
since then.

213
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:02,290
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think I've cast it 
since we came out the other side.

214
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:05,762
LIAM: Flying up on the broom, all that.

215
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:08,001
LAURA: Natural 20 for Pike!

216
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,624
TRAVIS: That's a good thing.

217
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:15,065
MATT: Great. She has disadvantage 
because of her armor. Roll again.

218
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:17,039
Well, no, she put on the elven boots, 
didn't she?

219
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,355
LAURA: No, Kima did.

220
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:20,601
MATT: That's right. So yeah, roll again.

221
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:21,943
LIAM: Just roll another 20.

222
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:24,912
TRAVIS: Just do it again. 
Here we go. Hi! Hey!

223
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,494
MARISHA: We've done it before 
and we can do it again.

224
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,341
TRAVIS: Not as great.

225
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:31,009
LIAM: Never mind.

226
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,692
TRAVIS: What is it?

227
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:33,717
LAURA: Four?

228
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:34,717
MATT: Four.

229
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:35,747
TRAVIS: Plus? Plus?

230
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,149
LAURA: Nothing.

231
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:38,444
TRAVIS: Cool. 13.

232
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:41,172
TALIESIN: Eight with a natural one.

233
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:46,694
MARISHA: Ten total.

234
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:48,360
SAM: Not good.

235
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,218
TRAVIS: Let's be honest, 
she fucking knows we're here.

236
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:57,842
PATRICK: This was my one 20 of the night, 
folks, everyone else--

237
00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:58,761
LAURA: Failed you.

238
00:13:58,761 --> 00:13:59,919
MARISHA: It just means you won't die first.

239
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:01,352
TALIESIN: She doesn't know you're here.

240
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:03,307
LAURA: Yeah, you're invisible. 
You have an invisibility ring.

241
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:04,903
PATRICK: I put on the ring and I just leave.

242
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:06,738
(all laugh)

243
00:14:06,738 --> 00:14:07,587
PATRICK: Just gone.

244
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:08,742
MATT: One step.

245
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:10,474
TALIESIN: And that's how 
Bilbo's insurance company started.

246
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,122
Just going home. We can start again
with a real job. I'm done.

247
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:13,981
LIAM: 30.

248
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:14,786
MATT: 30?

249
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:20,843
LAURA: Wait, the twins are rolling too? 
I should've taken that 20 for myself, then.

250
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,214
LIAM: Yeah, I thought you did.

251
00:14:22,214 --> 00:14:24,608
MATT: You guys are still 
on the same stealth roll as last time.

252
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:28,373
You're fine. Grog?

253
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:29,309
TRAVIS: 13.

254
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:30,324
MATT: 13.

255
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:33,426
LIAM: What the fuck was that?

256
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:35,558
LAURA: I don't know. 
Trinket's still in my necklace.

257
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:37,029
MATT: Trinket's still in your necklace.

258
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,972
LAURA: I left him in because he healed. 
He's in my necklace.

259
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:39,776
MATT: He is.

260
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:40,695
LAURA: Okay.

261
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:41,774
MATT: All right, so.

262
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:45,773
As you guys turn the corner 
on the right side of this hallway,

263
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:48,164
you saw this laboratory 
filled with bookshelves,

264
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:54,090
chains, candelabras on the walls, 
a large door across the back wall.

265
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:58,113
There are two pillars 
in the center of the room

266
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:02,333
that are strewn 
with various magical engravings.

267
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,373
You see this bunch of books 
scattered across the ground,

268
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:06,569
pulled out of the bookcase,

269
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:10,580
and there's one that's opened 
against this book-holding platform.

270
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:13,904
You see two cages 
in the back of each corner

271
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:18,094
that seem to contain 
some sort of slumped corpse

272
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:19,901
or body of some kind.

273
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:21,691
It's hard to see 
in the low light of this room

274
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:24,935
because the only light you're getting 
is from the candelabras in the space.

275
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:31,248
There you see the woman 
with long, dark green hair,

276
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:41,877
silverish pale skin, robes, 
piercing eyes of yellow and emerald.

277
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:45,567
As the rest of your party catches up 
from behind you

278
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,386
with the ever-so-subtle sounds

279
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:51,165
of metallic footfalls 
and plated armor against plated armor,

280
00:15:51,165 --> 00:16:00,594
the female figure seems unfazed by it

281
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:04,514
and just continues to turn a page 
and grab another book.

282
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:10,132
Takes a book and reads a passage of it 
and throws it off in the corner.

283
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,647
There's a pause 
before the female figure stops,

284
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:19,315
and still facing away, begins to speak out 
into the air of the room.

285
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:25,833
"Well, you certainly proved quicker 
than I anticipated,

286
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:31,406
"but I unfortunately have business here, 
and I would kindly ask you all to leave.

287
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:36,135
"The Conclave has served its purpose, 
as you have served yours.

288
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:38,440
"We have nothing more to discuss."

289
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,109
Turns another page of the book 
and continues facing away.

290
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:43,762
LIAM: Can I look at the ceiling, 
every other part of this room

291
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:46,611
except for where she is, 
to see if she's also somewhere else?

292
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:49,238
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

293
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:50,418
TRAVIS: I think we should just leave.

294
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:53,857
(all laugh)

295
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,115
LIAM: 22.

296
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:58,151
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, 
even with your low-light vision,

297
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:02,964
the halls here 
are roughly 20 to 25 feet wide

298
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:09,584
and about as much in height as well, 
25 to 30 feet tall, carved arches.

299
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:15,770
You don't see any other alcoves 
or hidden spaces.

300
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,653
It appears to be 
just this figure in this room

301
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:24,750
amongst the rotting corpse of Thordak 
and the two eggs tossed to the side.

302
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,927
PATRICK: I'm going to burn 
my final Divine Sense,

303
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:32,397
just because I've never been exposed 
to this creature at all.

304
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:35,074
She's got a lot of extra names

305
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:38,240
like "the Diseased" 
and "the Corrupter" and whatever,

306
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,518
so I don't know if she might be-- 
I have no idea.

307
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,765
I'm just trying 
to draw a bead on whatever's in the room.

308
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:46,107
MATT: Right.

309
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:50,382
PATRICK: It's 60 feet, and I think 
it's fiends, corrupted, and undead.

310
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,939
Location and type.

311
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,270
MATT: Correct, okay.

312
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:58,602
So as you hear these words 
echoing through the hallway around you,

313
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:00,447
the rest of the group, the tension rising.

314
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:04,298
You watch as just through a quick glance, 
each ally in the room,

315
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:08,012
their bodies just instinctually tighten,

316
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:10,518
their muscles getting ready for anything 
at this point in time.

317
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:13,302
You close your eyes and focus 
on the presence around you.

318
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,092
You do not sense anything.

319
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,573
PATRICK: Okay.

320
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:21,647
MATT: No celestials, 
no fiends, no undead.

321
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,011
LAURA: Did the party, 
as they were clomping along,

322
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:27,172
did they catch up with us at all, 
or are they still that far back?

323
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,239
MATT: They're still this far back, 
nobody has--

324
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,028
this is where you guys stopped 
upon the discussion happening,

325
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,349
so the twins are still up ahead.

326
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,535
The rest of the party 
is halfway through this unit here.

327
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:40,080
The actual chasm ends 
over on this side here,

328
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,027
and this is the entranceway 
with the fountain you had discovered.

329
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:45,022
TRAVIS: Somebody 
should roll off to the left.

330
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:46,658
LAURA: Before any of that happens, though,

331
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:52,439
I want to get Pike to step forward 
so she's within 30 feet of everybody.

332
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:55,307
As many people as possible. 
Can she be right in the middle?

333
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,664
MATT: That's about as close to middle 
as she can get right now.

334
00:18:57,664 --> 00:18:59,172
MARISHA: Can we all move up a little bit?

335
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:01,794
TALIESIN: I'm going to peel off 
a little bit to the left--

336
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:03,217
LAURA: But wait just a fucking second

337
00:19:03,217 --> 00:19:06,899
so she can cast Beacon of Hope 
on everybody! Just one second.

338
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:08,289
She's trying to help you.

339
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:11,593
TALIESIN: I just got yelled at 
in my earpiece, so I will not--

340
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,024
LAURA: Pike's like, 
"Just a fucking second!

341
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,670
"Let me cast Beacon of Hope!"

342
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,531
TALIESIN: Sorry, sorry.

343
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:16,804
TRAVIS: Pike swore.

344
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:19,624
MARISHA: Pike!

345
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:21,558
MATT: What's the range 
on Beacon of Hope?

346
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:22,688
LAURA: 30 feet.

347
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:23,927
MATT: 30 feet. All right.

348
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:27,098
So that would get... 
that would be everybody.

349
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:29,515
Everybody is currently under the effect 
of Beacon of Hope.

350
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,810
SAM: What does that mean?

351
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,228
PATRICK: Which is...

352
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:33,890
SAM: We are very hopeful now.

353
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:37,986
LAURA: Which means 
that you are hopeful and vital.

354
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,311
MATT: Is it a perpetual radius of her,

355
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,249
or does it affect each person 
at the time of casting?

356
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:45,271
LAURA: It affects everybody 
at the time of casting.

357
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,620
MATT: Okay.

358
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,358
LAURA: I think. 
It just says range is 30 feet.

359
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:51,141
Choose any number of creatures 
within range.

360
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:52,830
For the duration, each target 
has advantage

361
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,697
on wisdom saving throws 
and death saving throws,

362
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:57,642
and regains the maximum number 
of hit points when healed.

363
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:59,235
MATT: Yes, that's correct.

364
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,244
All of you guys have this effect on you 
as long as she maintains concentration.

365
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:08,364
So keep tabs on maximum healing 
and wisdom saves and death saves.

366
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,172
TALIESIN: Is she really there, 
or is that an illusion?

367
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:13,197
LAURA: I can't tell.

368
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,682
Can I tell if it's really an illusion, 
or does it look like she's really there?

369
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,962
MARISHA: Can you sense her?

370
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:19,294
TALIESIN: Yeah, try to sense.

371
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:21,078
LAURA: Well, I couldn't sense her before 
when she was in her human form,

372
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:23,110
so I'm assuming I can't sense her now.

373
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,253
MARISHA: Like she's got something 
masking her, that whole thing?

374
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,674
LAURA: Yeah, I mean.

375
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:29,111
TRAVIS: She's the Deceiver.

376
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:35,184
LAURA: I did the dragon-sense 
right before we came down this hallway

377
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:36,558
and I sensed three dragons down here.

378
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:37,668
TALIESIN: Okay.

379
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:39,159
MARISHA: Right. Okay.

380
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,497
MATT: Okay. In the time it's taken you guys 
to deliberate and discuss this,

381
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:43,344
and the long awkward pause 
that's transpired

382
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,724
after Raishan said 
the previous thing she did,

383
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:53,921
her voice picks up once again and says, 
"Whereabouts is your brass pet?"

384
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,972
LAURA: Whereabouts are you?

385
00:20:55,972 --> 00:21:00,312
MATT: No response.

386
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:04,135
MARISHA: Keyleth steps forward 
a little bit towards the twins.

387
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:05,855
TRAVIS: Percy and Grog 
are going to roll off to the left.

388
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:08,089
TALIESIN: We're peeling off to the left, 
and I'm going to wall-walk.

389
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:11,586
I'm going to keep going 
until I'm on line-of-sight

390
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,960
with the red eggs against the back wall.

391
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:17,175
MATT: You can get there.

392
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,544
TRAVIS: Cool.

393
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:22,786
TALIESIN: Not that far, not even that far,
like there. Yeah.

394
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:25,078
LIAM: I would like to move 
across from my sister

395
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,483
and move forward up to--

396
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:29,187
I can't tell from the overview, 
but a little bit of rock's right there?

397
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,336
MATT: Right there, yeah.

398
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:31,579
LIAM: And stay hidden.

399
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,344
MATT: There?

400
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,128
LIAM: Yeah.

401
00:21:33,128 --> 00:21:34,406
MATT: All righty.

402
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:39,521
MARISHA: Keyleth just says, 
"Did you find what you were looking for?"

403
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:47,683
MATT: "I did, actually. 
I discovered Thordak's original intent.

404
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:54,724
"Before the soul anchor drove him insane 
and he lost sight of his purpose.

405
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:56,643
"Well, it appears that it holds 
the same answer

406
00:21:56,663 --> 00:22:01,041
"that I've been seeking as well. 
So. In a word: yes."

407
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:06,308
MARISHA: And this is the answer to your... 
disease you were looking for? Your curse?

408
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:10,100
MATT: "Perhaps."

409
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,147
MARISHA: I'm assuming 
it has something to do with the soul gem.

410
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:16,242
Do you think you can resist 
the same type of madman mentality

411
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:19,579
that Thordak fell victim to 
when you anchor yourself?

412
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,844
MATT: Still facing away, you see 
the shoulders shift with a chuckle.

413
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:28,028
"I would not dare touch such a piece. 
It is far too dangerous.

414
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:32,630
"The soul gem is destroyed. 
It is of no use to me."

415
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:33,782
LAURA: While that conversation's going on,

416
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:37,199
I want to bamf Trinket out 
and send him around the other way.

417
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:38,217
TRAVIS: To the left?

418
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:39,135
MATT: Around this way?

419
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:40,791
LAURA: With Grog.

420
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:43,193
MATT: Okay, have Trinket 
roll a stealth check, if you could.

421
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:44,361
LAURA: Okay.

422
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,955
MATT: Being a big bear.

423
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:50,605
LAURA: Come on, Trinket! 
You're so quiet-- ooh! Trinket rolls a 19.

424
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:51,970
TRAVIS: Why a stealth check?

425
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,350
SAM: Maybe the lair or something.

426
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,358
LAURA: Well maybe 
she doesn't know Trinket's here.

427
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:05,019
PATRICK: I'll move up a little bit, too.

428
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:08,086
MATT: To how far?

429
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:09,392
PATRICK: Enough so that hopefully

430
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:12,679
I can get as many people 
within ten feet as possible,

431
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,011
and ideally within 30 feet, 
if I need to rush and attack.

432
00:23:17,015 --> 00:23:23,407
MATT: Okay. Currently, you are in a space 
to get three people in your area.

433
00:23:23,456 --> 00:23:24,881
You could either move forward with them,

434
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,653
or if you wish to push forward 
on your own,

435
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,727
you are currently not visible.

436
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:34,646
PATRICK: Right, yeah.

437
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:43,936
MATT: Okay. Kima is going to follow along 
with Grog and Trinket.

438
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:47,658
Allura feels the lack 
of magical force on this side,

439
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:51,077
is going to follow 
up behind you guys as well.

440
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:52,363
TRAVIS: I'm over there.

441
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:57,739
(all laugh)

442
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:00,423
MATT: Even with her hood up, 
she gives you a glance like--

443
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,574
TRAVIS: Stay behind me.

444
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,525
MATT: Well, of course I am, 
that's part of the reason.

445
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:11,715
MARISHA: Magic Grog, 
the Magic Mike sequel.

446
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,033
MATT: Scanlan?

447
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:17,264
SAM: I'll inch up a little, still hiding 
behind those outcroppings there,

448
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:21,823
and then I'm going to call out the dog.

449
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:23,979
LAURA: Ooh, nice! 
Pike's going to walk to the middle,

450
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,509
where she's in between the two parties.

451
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:29,311
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's really clever.

452
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:35,716
SAM: I'm going to summon the dog. 
I just say, "Good doggy!" Right?

453
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,196
And I throw the figurine.

454
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:39,062
LIAM: (posh voice) Hello.

455
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:42,913
(all laugh)

456
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:46,852
LAURA: Like Reginald or something? 
What was his name?

457
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,417
SAM: I forget-- 
we never figured out his name.

458
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:52,655
We know it, or something. 
You said-- it was very cryptic.

459
00:24:52,662 --> 00:24:54,703
MARISHA: I did write it down 
at one point in time,

460
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,624
but I'm not going to look for it right now.

461
00:24:56,631 --> 00:25:00,154
MATT: The dog hops out. 
I'll use this badger for the time being.

462
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,254
SAM: You put a badger down?

463
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:04,064
MATT: I couldn't find 
an actual dog figure.

464
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,747
MARISHA: The badger? 
That's even better!

465
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:07,269
LIAM: I've got a mastiff. I'll donate it.

466
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:09,321
MATT: It still works fine!

467
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:11,398
SAM: Badger doesn't give a shit.

468
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:15,900
LAURA: And then Pike wants 
to walk in between the two parties,

469
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:18,294
so hiding behind that wall outcropping.

470
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:29,996
MATT: Okay. All right. At this point, 
the air itself is still very still,

471
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:31,707
and the closer you get to this 
as you approach,

472
00:25:31,707 --> 00:25:35,456
the smell of decay 
is as overwhelming as it was

473
00:25:35,456 --> 00:25:39,766
in the chasm that you crossed before.

474
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:41,756
Raishan continues to speak and says,

475
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:46,317
"You may also come to notice 
a curiosity about this island

476
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:49,379
"that explains 
a lot of the legends around it.

477
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:52,770
"Sadly, the pressures of time 
left me forgetting until I arrived,

478
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:56,982
"which has limited my options.

479
00:25:56,982 --> 00:26:04,690
"I had only used the glyph once before, 
years ago, but... it is as it is.

480
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:09,301
"So I ask you once again: 
we made a deal.

481
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:14,162
"You rescinded on that deal 
and punishment was required.

482
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:17,131
"You survive only by my grace

483
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:21,446
"and your stubborn need 
to cling to your insignificant lives.

484
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:24,338
"Regardless, I have what I sought now,

485
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,552
"and I offer you this opportunity 
to leave freely.

486
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:31,622
"Decline, and you choose 
your resting place here,

487
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:34,567
"away from your loved ones, 
to be forgotten

488
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:43,683
"and join the undying dregs
of a long-passed madman's fancy."

489
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:45,501
TRAVIS: Somebody do something.

490
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,628
SAM: Maybe we should just leave.

491
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:53,297
MARISHA: Keyleth steps forward again, 
a little bit more, and says--

492
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:55,573
MATT: You bump into the shoulders--

493
00:26:55,573 --> 00:27:01,096
MARISHA: "Excuse me. Sorry. 
I just want to, I just, okay."

494
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:04,862
I want to keep walking up to her 
as much as I can.

495
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:08,132
MATT: Okay. 
So you step out of the shadows.

496
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:09,742
MARISHA: Yes.

497
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:12,158
PATRICK: Shit, I've got to follow-- 
if I see her moving--

498
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,794
I can't. I'm not good with that.

499
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:15,904
MATT: Okay.

500
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:17,583
TRAVIS: I would also, 
on the other side,

501
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:22,168
like to advance as far as I can 
without reaching her eyeline.

502
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:26,184
MATT: You would be about there. 
Kima sneaks up behind you,

503
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:30,261
Trinket follows up behind there, 
and Allura stays just to one side there.

504
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:31,264
MARISHA: While all this is happening,

505
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:38,723
Keyleth is speaking 
to try and keep her attention.

506
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:44,080
"You know, Raishan, 
you've taught me a lot about myself,

507
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,567
these past few weeks; 
arguably more

508
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:52,018
than I've learned about myself 
my entire years of living."

509
00:27:52,023 --> 00:27:56,700
MATT: "Good. I'm glad I could enlighten 
and inspire in these final moments."

510
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:03,770
MARISHA: Inspiration's a word 
I guess you could use.

511
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,742
I would say more of a cautionary tale.

512
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:14,520
In an odd way, 
I hope I never become you.

513
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:21,364
All those years of long life 
That some many call a blessing.

514
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:28,941
I'm sure there are many lonely moments, 
and I hope, in my darkest of times,

515
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:35,066
I don't turn to rage and anger 
and selfish actions the way you did.

516
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:40,714
MATT: "You know nothing about me, child. 
Nothing."

517
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,527
MARISHA: That may be true.

518
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,785
MATT: She turns around for the first time 
to meet your eyes,

519
00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:49,061
and you can see the gleam 
of bright, sickly yellow

520
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,677
and dark, deep emerald green for pupils

521
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:55,683
as she turns with a slight smile 
just curling across her porcelain skin.

522
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:59,476
MARISHA: I see I have your attention 
after all.

523
00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:02,825
MATT: "You've had my attention 
since you entered this place.

524
00:29:02,838 --> 00:29:06,656
"You aren't the subtlest of adventurers."

525
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:10,887
MARISHA: No. We... I mean, we know.

526
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:14,504
(all laugh)

527
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,937
TALIESIN: That's what I was waiting for. 
Thank you.

528
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:24,256
MARISHA: Touche.

529
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:32,982
MATT: "So what is it? You've come here 
to speak on your enlightenment and die?

530
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:36,408
"Or do we wish to maintain 
the agreement we had,

531
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,688
"go our own separate ways--"

532
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,740
SAM: I'm going to really quickly 
whisper to the dog,

533
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,552
"Do you see anything that we don't?"

534
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:54,512
MATT: The dog looks around. "No."

535
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:57,391
SAM: Good doggy.

536
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,575
MARISHA: You're correct.

537
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:07,144
We reneged on our deal, 
just as you did on your end.

538
00:30:07,144 --> 00:30:13,179
There was a mutual distrust. 
We knew that from the beginning.

539
00:30:13,182 --> 00:30:15,416
MATT: "That makes us even, then, 
does it not?"

540
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:20,164
MARISHA: It does. 
But, in terms of negotiation,

541
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:32,784
you presented your deal, 
so we will now present ours.

542
00:30:32,784 --> 00:30:35,093
LAURA: I'm backing up, 
but I'm drawing an arrow

543
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:38,149
and just notching it and waiting to see 
if she does anything to Keyleth.

544
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:43,742
MATT: Okay.

545
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:51,552
MARISHA: My want for revenge against you, 
while still strong and very palpable,

546
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:57,150
I now understand was ultimately selfish

547
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,632
only in the sense 
that everyone else in Tal'Dorei

548
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:08,269
should share in the revelry 
of bringing you to justice.

549
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:12,420
I am not the only one--
we are not the only ones--

550
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:19,161
who have felt the ramifications 
of your destructive actions.

551
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:24,152
And as much as I would like to make do 
on my promise that I told you weeks ago,

552
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:26,640
and end your life right now,

553
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:33,352
I desperately want the rest of Tal'Dorei 
to feel that satisfaction as well.

554
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:40,801
So. You surrender now, 
you come with us

555
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:50,490
under means of temporary control, 
we take you back to Emon--

556
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,927
maybe the Fire Ashari; 
we'll work that out,

557
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:56,812
we're going to take you 
and you face trial

558
00:31:56,812 --> 00:32:00,901
amongst the Tal'Dorei Council,
the people of the Ashari,

559
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:05,533
and on behalf 
of the rest of the citizens of Exandria.

560
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:13,101
If you choose to not take this offer, 
then I guess we will see

561
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:19,488
whose final resting place 
it will be in this cave.

562
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,197
MATT: The book 
that she currently had in her hands

563
00:32:21,197 --> 00:32:23,329
closes in her grasp

564
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:28,606
as her eyes don't flicker or shift 
or blink from your connection.

565
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:30,901
She looks to you 
with her chin raised a bit.

566
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:35,181
MARISHA: I mirror her. 
Puff up a little bit.

567
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:38,275
MATT: You act as though 
the laws of the anthill

568
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:42,332
affect the foot that crushes it.

569
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:46,575
You speak words of importance, 
but I've seen laws and people

570
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:51,556
come and go, change, die, 
turn to dust and rise again.

571
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:56,833
People kill neighbor. 
Families die from the inside and out.

572
00:32:56,833 --> 00:33:02,335
You see, I'm diseased, but look upon you. 
You insignificant creatures.

573
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:08,668
You do more to your own people 
than I've done in an entire lifetime.

574
00:33:08,668 --> 00:33:13,602
MARISHA: That might be true, 
but at least that is the fate

575
00:33:13,602 --> 00:33:16,828
of our own consequences 
and our own doing,

576
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:22,122
not some outwardly force 
forcing their repercussions on us.

577
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:25,335
And you should know, Raishan,

578
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:28,914
I've stepped on plenty of anthills 
in my day.

579
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:34,508
Those that don't die revolt. 
And guess what?

580
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:40,614
There are some pretty nasty stings 
from some ants out there.

581
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:44,032
LAURA: They'll leave a welt. 
You'll itch for days.

582
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:47,869
MARISHA: The strength of a colony 
is stronger

583
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:55,142
than the individual 
of one great diseased foot.

584
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:58,644
MATT: "You are truly not intending 
to leave me be, are you?"

585
00:33:58,644 --> 00:34:00,574
MARISHA: Nope.

586
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:05,133
MATT: "Well, that is such 
an unfortunate disposition on your part.

587
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:09,750
"Interestingly enough--" 
And she thumbs a couple of pages 
in the next book,

588
00:34:09,752 --> 00:34:12,097
closes it, 
and throws it to the side.

589
00:34:12,112 --> 00:34:18,633
"My needs do happen to call 
for a handful of powerful magic-users.

590
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:24,173
"And there are proper tools 
within these caverns to keep you in line.

591
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:30,129
"So we shall call 
your foolishness kismet."

592
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:33,981
MARISHA: I guess 
we can say the same for yours.

593
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,473
I guess it's a matter of who wins, now.

594
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,968
MATT: Very well.

595
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:40,944
MARISHA: I'm giving you one last shot.

596
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:44,192
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark her. 
At 2nd level, because that's what I have.

597
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:45,692
MATT: Okay.

598
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:51,525
LIAM: Same.

599
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:52,271
MATT: What do you do?

600
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:55,541
LIAM: Hunter's Mark.

601
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,935
MARISHA: Surrender, 
and if you choose not to,

602
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:03,923
at least we can go forward 
in our consciences

603
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:06,840
and know that we gave you a choice.

604
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,301
MATT: So as you guys are casting the spell 
and she's saying this,

605
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:14,719
Raishan responds with, 
"I shall relish closing the final chapter

606
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:17,481
"on your brief, pitiful tales,

607
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:22,216
"and beginning a fresh, new chapter 
of my own."

608
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:26,526
As you guys both mark, 
the spell has no effect,

609
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:30,235
takes no root in the space.

610
00:35:30,235 --> 00:35:33,783
You maintain concentration, 
but nothing was marked.

611
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:39,533
There is nothing there, physical.

612
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:42,264
TALIESIN: The dog, in theory, 
sees invisible things, by the way.

613
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:46,472
SAM: It's not invisible. 
She's not there.

614
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:49,611
MARISHA: Is she a hologram? 
Is she an illusion?

615
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:51,108
TRAVIS: What are we doing?

616
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,142
MATT: What are you doing? 
Aside from rolling initiative,

617
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:58,927
which I think probably would be 
a good thing to do right now.

618
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,705
So let's go ahead and roll initiative now.

619
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:04,408
MARISHA: Wait. 
That's the dead body of Thordak, right?

620
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,447
MATT: Correct.

621
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:09,457
MARISHA: She's not possessing Thordak, 
is she? She's speaking through him--

622
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:12,451
LIAM: No, the paladin checked for undead.

623
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:14,165
LAURA: I sensed three dragons.

624
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:15,838
MARISHA: Oh, undead, that's right.

625
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:17,484
PATRICK: I would've probably sensed,

626
00:36:17,484 --> 00:36:19,045
unless there's some sort of masking 
going on here.

627
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:20,178
LAURA: Which she's good at.

628
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:21,786
MATT: (laughs)

629
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,868
LAURA: Oh man, I don't like hearing that.

630
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:25,693
MARISHA: Lucky green, lucky green, come on!

631
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:27,559
TALIESIN: (laughs) I'm sorry.

632
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,944
MARISHA: Ah, if it wasn't so ironic...

633
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,763
LAURA: That's a bad Taliesin laugh.

634
00:36:31,763 --> 00:36:33,251
TALIESIN: (singing) It's like rain...

635
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:35,189
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: 
(singing) On your wedding day!

636
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,600
TRAVIS: Please do not sing that song.

637
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:42,693
TALIESIN: We'll be doomed to die 
if we sing that song any further.

638
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:49,932
MATT: So. Folks. 
Initiative tracking going down now.

639
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:51,530
We have 25 to 20.

640
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:52,295
LIAM: 25.

641
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:53,692
LAURA: 24.

642
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:54,545
TALIESIN: 22.

643
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,497
SAM: 21.

644
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:56,227
PATRICK: Jeez!

645
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:59,426
MARISHA: Thank god you guys are alive. 
Thank fuck.

646
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:00,526
MATT: 25, 24?

647
00:37:00,526 --> 00:37:02,035
SAM: 21.

648
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:02,843
MATT: 21.

649
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:03,768
TALIESIN: 22.

650
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:15,104
MATT: 22. All right. 20 to 15?

651
00:37:15,106 --> 00:37:27,151
TRAVIS: 16.

652
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:30,724
PATRICK: Did you roll for Pike?

653
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:33,769
LAURA: Yeah, I did, I rolled for Pike. 
She got eight, Pike got eight.

654
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:35,904
MATT: Pike got eight. 
Keyleth, what did you get?

655
00:37:35,904 --> 00:37:38,152
MARISHA: Four!

656
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:40,331
MATT: Kerrek?

657
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:42,942
PATRICK: You don't add proficiency bonus. 
It's only a dex bonus, right?

658
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:44,241
MATT: Just dex bonus, correct.

659
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,318
PATRICK: Then 11.

660
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:48,221
MATT: Okay. So we have...

661
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:50,685
TALIESIN: You don't add proficiency bonus?

662
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:55,865
PATRICK: That's what I was asking about 
for dex. For initiative, rather.

663
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:57,578
MARISHA: I think that's you, 
because you're a fancy fighter.

664
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,079
TALIESIN: I'm weird, okay. 
That's a weird thing.

665
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:01,524
TRAVIS: So Keyleth got the lowest?
You got the lowest one?

666
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:03,199
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: Yeah.

667
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,400
MARISHA: I was talking. 
I was giving a very compelling speech.

668
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,190
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was writing it down. 
With my inability to write.

669
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:17,734
MATT: All righty. So. 
Top of the round, currently.

670
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:19,242
Vax, what are you doing?

671
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:20,277
LIAM: And we see nothing.

672
00:38:20,293 --> 00:38:21,589
MATT: You see nothing now. 
You just see

673
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:29,161
the apparently not-physically-there 
humanoid form of Raishan,

674
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,953
still standing on the opposite side.

675
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,488
LIAM: And two eggs.

676
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:35,382
MATT: Two eggs here, and the corpse.

677
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,807
LIAM: All right, I'm going to cross 
back across, north, to the--

678
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:42,610
I mean, I click on the Boots of Haste. 
I'm going to move 
straight towards you, Matt,

679
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,965
across the hall 
so I'm by the corner there.

680
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:45,874
MATT: Over here?

681
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:50,623
LIAM: No, not that far. No, closer to me. 
Right there.

682
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:54,091
And I'm going to throw at the eggs.

683
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:56,271
MATT: Okay.

684
00:38:56,271 --> 00:38:58,843
LIAM: And it's... I'm going first,

685
00:38:58,852 --> 00:39:01,130
so with Assassinate, 
I get advantage on all these

686
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,220
because I'm the first to go in combat? 
Yes? Yep.

687
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,658
MATT: Sure.

688
00:39:07,658 --> 00:39:09,033
LIAM: Starting at third level, 
you are deadly,

689
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:10,382
so you get the drop on your enemies.

690
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:11,341
You have advantage on attack rolls 
against any creature

691
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:12,899
that hasn't taken a turn 
in the combat yet.

692
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,400
MATT: Okay. Sure.

693
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,614
The eggs have not taken a turn 
in the combat yet.

694
00:39:16,614 --> 00:39:18,082
LIAM: That's great.

695
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:24,098
And I'm going to use sharpshooter, 
so I get a negative five on these.

696
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,472
TRAVIS: The eggs have't taken a turn yet.

697
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,127
MATT: Vax'ildan, the Egg Assassin.

698
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:29,774
LIAM: Yeah! 21 for the first.

699
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:30,585
MATT: That hits.

700
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:31,441
LIAM: Okay.

701
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:33,535
TRAVIS: (trailer voice) This Easter, 
the eggs have not taken a turn.

702
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:36,160
MATT: (trailer voice) 
Prepare to be scrambled.

703
00:39:36,177 --> 00:39:39,858
LIAM: (laughing) The second one is 18.

704
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:41,292
MATT: 18 hits.

705
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:47,435
LIAM: Okay. And that is-- 
oh, that's not that good. Is 14.

706
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:51,891
MATT: 14? Okay.

707
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,474
LIAM: Do they all three hit, 
or just the first two?

708
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,642
MATT: First two.

709
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:59,162
LIAM: First two. Okay. 
So the first one gets sneak attack damage.

710
00:39:59,162 --> 00:40:02,029
LAURA: Those eggs
don't even know you're coming.

711
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:04,166
LIAM: That's right. 
What, you want them to take less damage?

712
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,389
LAURA: Oh no.

713
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:07,024
LIAM: Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

714
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:08,636
MATT: These eggs are caught unaware.

715
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:11,089
TALIESIN: This'll be over easy.

716
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,594
TRAVIS: Taliesin.

717
00:40:14,604 --> 00:40:16,265
TALIESIN: I'm so proud. So proud.

718
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:28,249
(all laugh)

719
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:30,486
LIAM: 32 for that one.

720
00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:31,891
PATRICK: Eggcellent.

721
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:34,209
(all groan)

722
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:37,551
PATRICK: I didn't start this, 
but I will finish it.

723
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:41,016
LIAM: And what the heck, 
I'm going to poison that egg,

724
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,059
so that is (laughing) Seven.

725
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:48,478
That egg has to make a DC 15 success 
against poison.

726
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:53,618
(all laugh)

727
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:57,108
MATT: Succeeds with a natural 17.

728
00:40:57,118 --> 00:41:00,935
LIAM: So, does it get half? 
Or... half, right? Or none?

729
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:04,732
I don't know. 
I've never killed an egg before.

730
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:06,349
MATT: I mean, it still takes 
the full sneak attack damage,

731
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,865
and it is not poisoned.

732
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:09,141
LIAM: Not poisoned. So give it

733
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:11,397
another seven hit points of damage
from the dagger itself.

734
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:13,088
MATT: A total of...?

735
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:16,641
LIAM: Seven for that second attack. 
The earlier one was 32.

736
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,309
Isn't Dungeons and Dragons fun?

737
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,437
LAURA: Eggs, you guys. Eggs.

738
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,648
MATT: So as you rush past, 
and careening around the corner,

739
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:25,352
throwing these three daggers 
out to the side,

740
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:28,037
the first one just smacks into the side,

741
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:33,720
and the egg, which had already 
been previously damaged structure-wise

742
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:40,381
by a somewhat resistant but still impactful 
burst of druidic magic energy

743
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,921
in the previous conflict,

744
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:44,805
the first dagger cuts through 
like a hot knife through butter,

745
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,181
out the side of the egg.

746
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:48,243
You watch as the shell on the other side 
just scatters,

747
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:52,550
causing this splatter of some sort 
of thick liquid against the wall.

748
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,180
The other two daggers, 
one just careens off to the side,

749
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,530
the second one that does impact

750
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,300
continues and causes the egg 
to actually crack and fold in on itself,

751
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,317
causing it to leak out 
the side of the shell

752
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:05,906
as it collapses in on itself somewhat.

753
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:07,542
SAM: That's one egg down?

754
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:11,805
MATT: So that egg there 
I will mark as currently--

755
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:12,882
LAURA: Scrambled.

756
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:13,866
MARISHA: Sunny side up.

757
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:16,338
MATT:Destroyed.

758
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:18,085
TALIESIN: Florentine.

759
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:20,730
TRAVIS: Benedict.

760
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,085
LAURA: Poached.

761
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:23,563
MATT: There you go. 
That one is destroyed.

762
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:25,886
TALIESIN: Poached.

763
00:42:25,886 --> 00:42:27,395
MATT: All right. Does that end your turn?

764
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:29,374
LIAM: Yeah, I'll stick with it.

765
00:42:29,374 --> 00:42:30,794
MATT: Okay. Next up is Vex.

766
00:42:30,794 --> 00:42:32,727
LAURA: That's me.

767
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:35,235
I'm going to immediately say 
over the earring,

768
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:38,660
"I don't think she's really there,"

769
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:45,190
and then try to look and see anything, 
any sign of her that I can spot.

770
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,127
Can I see anything?

771
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:52,741
MATT: Make a perception check.

772
00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:54,445
LAURA: 30.

773
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:58,677
MATT: 30. Glancing around you
in the current space,

774
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:02,317
that is definitively an illusion, 
and in fact the way it shimmers--

775
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:06,231
and you look at the books 
that it was using and messing with.

776
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:11,393
While you were keeping more of an eye 
on the area, you notice now

777
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:13,379
that the books that she dropped 
just vanished.

778
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:14,314
LAURA: Oh.

779
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:17,003
MATT: It was all part of the illusion.

780
00:43:17,003 --> 00:43:19,574
Definitely not there, 
but you don't see anything around you

781
00:43:19,574 --> 00:43:24,049
that resembles a hidden or stealthed 
dragon-sized creature.

782
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:26,119
LAURA: Okay.

783
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,754
MATT: What else would you like to do 
with your turn?

784
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:34,606
LAURA: Fuck. I think I'm going to save--

785
00:43:34,606 --> 00:43:37,426
I'm going to back up against the wall, 
just straight back.

786
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:38,474
MATT: Right here?

787
00:43:38,474 --> 00:43:41,830
LAURA: Yeah. Because I feel 
very uncomfortable with the situation

788
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,271
and I'm going to save my attack
for if Thordak moves,

789
00:43:46,271 --> 00:43:52,340
if anything moves at all, 
I'm going to wait to attack it.

790
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,416
MATT: Attack it?

791
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:55,552
So you're holding your attack action 
in case something moves.

792
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:59,553
LAURA: Yeah. In case Thordak moves 
or I see Raishan or something.

793
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:08,660
MATT: Okay, cool. Percival. 
Still on this back wall here.

794
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,460
TALIESIN: Okay. First things first.

795
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:17,240
I'm going to take a shot with Bad News 
at the remaining egg.

796
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,436
MATT: Okay.

797
00:44:19,436 --> 00:44:27,346
TALIESIN: So let's just do that. 
Why are you doing that? Okay, good.

798
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:30,053
That's a 22 to hit?

799
00:44:30,053 --> 00:44:31,274
MATT: That hits.

800
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:42,167
TALIESIN: So that's... ooh, that's nice. 
25 points of damage.

801
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:45,931
MATT: All righty. The first shot hits.

802
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:49,126
You see the front of the egg 
spider-crack inward,

803
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:51,039
like how you shot in the Thordak battle,

804
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,120
but the egg still holds firm.

805
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,013
As you begin loading for your next shot,

806
00:44:58,013 --> 00:45:02,439
you watch as part of the egg 
begins to crack outward,

807
00:45:02,439 --> 00:45:07,799
like something's pushing out 
from the inside of the egg.

808
00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:15,049
TALIESIN: Okay, never mind. 
Then I'm going to take another--

809
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:18,876
okay, I'm going to take 
another Sharpshooter shot at it.

810
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:22,120
I'm going to try to hit it and kill it dead.

811
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:33,304
Yeah, I'm having a weird premonition 
that's making me really uncomfortable.

812
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:34,919
16?

813
00:45:34,919 --> 00:45:36,418
MATT: 16 to hit?

814
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:37,819
TALIESIN: Yeah.

815
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,983
MATT: With its armor, 
that probably won't hit, unfortunately.

816
00:45:41,983 --> 00:45:46,834
The bullet ricochets 
off the outside of the hardened eggshell

817
00:45:46,834 --> 00:45:49,020
and just (ricochet sound).

818
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,801
LIAM: I don't know 
if it makes a difference,

819
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:52,584
I called Sharpshooter on my shots before

820
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,162
but forgot to add 
the additional ten per attack.

821
00:45:55,162 --> 00:45:57,649
MATT: You destroyed the egg.

822
00:45:57,649 --> 00:45:59,556
You threw them all simultaneously 
at a single egg.

823
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,790
LIAM: Okay.

824
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,255
MARISHA: Did you add ten to yours 
just now?

825
00:46:04,255 --> 00:46:07,048
TALIESIN: No, sharpshooter 
I lose five to hit,

826
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:12,880
which is why I didn't hit it,
but I get ten extra points of damage.

827
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,939
I'm feeling like now is the time 
to take this out of play,

828
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:19,730
so I'm going to burn an... 
Action Surge right now.

829
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:22,370
I'm going to burn an Action Surge.

830
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,296
MATT: Sure, buddy.

831
00:46:24,296 --> 00:46:27,768
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take 
another shot with Bad News.

832
00:46:27,768 --> 00:46:29,292
(nerdy voice) Action Surge.

833
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:30,408
MATT: Go for it.

834
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:31,648
TALIESIN: Same thing, sharpshooter shot.

835
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,808
MATT: Do it.

836
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:34,072
TRAVIS: (nerdy voice) 
It's time for an Action Surge.

837
00:46:34,072 --> 00:46:35,397
LIAM: (nerdy voice) Raishan!

838
00:46:35,397 --> 00:46:36,418
(all laugh)

839
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,590
TALIESIN: That misses.

840
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,192
MATT: Ricochets off again.

841
00:46:39,192 --> 00:46:42,677
TALIESIN: Oh man, regular shot, 
because fuck it.

842
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:44,358
MARISHA: That's better!

843
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:48,803
TALIESIN: That hits. That's 32 to hit. 
I should've just taken it.

844
00:46:48,803 --> 00:46:51,922
But that's okay, 
we'll see what we do damage-wise.

845
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:56,778
That's not bad.
22 points of damage.

846
00:46:56,778 --> 00:47:01,331
MATT: With the second shot, 
you tear the top half of the egg off.

847
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:05,537
As it goes splattering to the side of it, 
you can watch as what looks to be

848
00:47:05,537 --> 00:47:10,129
some sort of a very, very young 
primordial dragon

849
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:12,803
like the ones that you had yanked 
out of the eggs before

850
00:47:12,803 --> 00:47:15,123
that was trying to pull its way 
out of the egg,

851
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:20,965
slumps lifelessly 
over the side of the egg you destroyed.

852
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:30,652
SAM: Aw. You're terrible, Taliesin. 
You're so hard-boiled.

853
00:47:30,652 --> 00:47:33,309
MATT: That's awful.

854
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,204
TALIESIN: I don't suppose I have time 
to run a weird perception check, do I?

855
00:47:36,204 --> 00:47:37,782
Really quickly?

856
00:47:37,782 --> 00:47:40,004
Do I have a moment 
for a perception check?

857
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:42,226
MATT: You've used all your action 
and your bonus action...

858
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,879
TALIESIN: I haven't burned 
any movement, though.

859
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:45,965
MATT: What are you looking for?

860
00:47:45,965 --> 00:47:49,100
TALIESIN: Is that center wall real?

861
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,896
MATT: This center wall here?

862
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:57,560
This would be 
an investigation check.

863
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:02,496
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm calling that. 23?

864
00:48:02,496 --> 00:48:04,558
MATT: 23. 
Glancing over across the way,

865
00:48:04,558 --> 00:48:06,824
best you can tell, 
the wall appears to be solid

866
00:48:06,824 --> 00:48:10,704
and is an actual, natural barrier 
in the cavern.

867
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:12,908
TALIESIN: Okay, 
just wanted to have my moment.

868
00:48:12,908 --> 00:48:14,821
LAURA: Oh my god, 
that would've been so smart, though.

869
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:19,258
TALIESIN: I had a moment of horror like, 
oh god, that's dragon-sized. Okay, cool.

870
00:48:19,258 --> 00:48:21,704
MARISHA: Yeah, that's her.

871
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:23,461
It could still be her.

872
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:24,437
TALIESIN: Yeah.

873
00:48:24,437 --> 00:48:26,570
MARISHA: He could've 
just not rolled high enough.

874
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:31,861
MATT: So that ends your turn.
At the end of Percy's turn,

875
00:48:31,861 --> 00:48:39,123
the human figure across the way 
with the dark green hair gives a deep bow.

876
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:40,541
LAURA: Oh no.

877
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,739
MATT: And then vanishes from the field.

878
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:46,891
LAURA: No.

879
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,744
TRAVIS: That wasn't so bad.

880
00:48:48,744 --> 00:48:49,985
SAM: We won!

881
00:48:49,985 --> 00:48:51,519
LAURA: Good job, guys.

882
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:53,043
MARISHA: We just made her leave.

883
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:55,926
MATT: The dog turns around 
and faces this direction

884
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:57,229
and starts barking.

885
00:48:57,229 --> 00:49:00,081
SAM: Yes. Yes!

886
00:49:00,081 --> 00:49:02,624
TALIESIN: Good boy.

887
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:09,324
MATT: You just hear (heavy footsteps) 
and then suddenly (flapping wings),

888
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:13,000
there's suddenly a torrent of wind 
blowing within the area

889
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,666
as something 
is disturbing the air quite heavily.

890
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:21,544
So that's that.

891
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:27,269
LAURA: I am holding my action 
until Raishan does anything.

892
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:31,844
I hope she attacks-- well no, 
I hope we get to attack her soon.

893
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:35,293
MATT: That's going to be the end 
of Raishan's turn.

894
00:49:35,293 --> 00:49:36,912
TRAVIS: Really? Just the sound?

895
00:49:36,912 --> 00:49:39,866
MATT: Yeah. 
You all of a sudden hear the mastiff

896
00:49:39,866 --> 00:49:43,133
barking over and over again 
in this direction.

897
00:49:43,133 --> 00:49:46,630
LAURA: Do I see, did I-- 
oh god, I can't, it's not my turn.

898
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,222
MATT: But you don't see anything.

899
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:50,479
LAURA: No. Did my hair go whoosh?

900
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:51,583
MATT: A little bit.

901
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:52,832
LAURA: Okay.

902
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:53,973
LIAM: It's kind of always doing that a little bit, though.

903
00:49:53,973 --> 00:49:55,033
LAURA: I mean, a little bit.

904
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,754
MATT: Scanlan, it's your turn.

905
00:49:57,754 --> 00:50:04,129
SAM: I turn to face in the direction
that my dog is looking.

906
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:09,808
And... shitballs. 
Who's that near me back there?

907
00:50:09,808 --> 00:50:13,776
MATT: This is Vex. That's Pike.

908
00:50:13,776 --> 00:50:18,127
SAM: Okay. Vex I will inspire 
with a quick limerick.

909
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:20,777
LAURA: Oh?

910
00:50:20,777 --> 00:50:28,478
SAM: Gern Blanston wept and wept-o,
his wonderful broom had been swept-o,

911
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:32,656
first our Vex spied it, 
then she Shanghai'd it,

912
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:35,115
because it turns out she's a total klepto.

913
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:39,795
(all laugh)

914
00:50:39,795 --> 00:50:41,837
MATT: You can take your d12 inspiration.

915
00:50:41,837 --> 00:50:44,013
LAURA: Bringing it back.

916
00:50:44,013 --> 00:50:49,556
SAM: And then I will-- balls.

917
00:50:49,556 --> 00:50:52,121
I want to hold my thing to-- 
but I'm not going to.

918
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:55,354
I'm going to hope this works 
and the dragon's coming at us.

919
00:50:55,354 --> 00:51:00,978
Maybe. I'm going to step forward

920
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:04,703
as much as I can 
towards the sound I heard

921
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:15,247
and blow my horn of fog just everywhere.

922
00:51:15,247 --> 00:51:18,760
LIAM: Can't you put that drug pipe down 
for like five seconds?

923
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,005
SAM: Don't take it away from me, man!

924
00:51:21,005 --> 00:51:22,496
TRAVIS: Blow one note.

925
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,542
SAM: It's for tobacco, okay?

926
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:28,495
(all laugh)

927
00:51:28,495 --> 00:51:34,604
MATT: All righty.

928
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:40,835
PATRICK: This is going to settle 
a lot of bets on who vapes.

929
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:43,823
MATT: All right, so yeah, 
20-foot radius...

930
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:47,750
so you create this area here, 
and obscures it.

931
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:52,107
So currently, this whole tunnel 
is just filled with fog.

932
00:51:52,107 --> 00:51:55,065
You have no vision 
beyond the outside of it,

933
00:51:55,065 --> 00:51:56,925
right where you are.

934
00:51:56,925 --> 00:51:58,502
SAM: All right. Good.

935
00:51:58,502 --> 00:52:01,759
But if something comes through, 
it will disturb the fog, correct?

936
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:03,304
MATT: It may.

937
00:52:03,304 --> 00:52:04,370
SAM: Oh, shit.

938
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,184
(all laugh)

939
00:52:07,187 --> 00:52:09,914
TALIESIN: Congratulations, 
we can play Laser Tag now.

940
00:52:09,914 --> 00:52:12,855
MATT: All right. 
That ends your turn, Scanlan?

941
00:52:12,855 --> 00:52:15,705
SAM: Yeah, I'll just say, 
"I think she's over here, guys!"

942
00:52:15,705 --> 00:52:16,975
And that's it.

943
00:52:16,975 --> 00:52:19,730
MATT: All right, Grog, your turn.

944
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:25,182
TRAVIS: I rage and-- I would like to rage.

945
00:52:25,182 --> 00:52:26,782
MATT: Okay.

946
00:52:26,782 --> 00:52:32,123
TRAVIS: With my 50 feet of speed, 
can I try to make it to Thordak's corpse?

947
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:33,819
See how far I get?

948
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:36,235
MARISHA: Yes, yes, get it. Get it!

949
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:38,177
MATT: You get right up to it, yeah.

950
00:52:38,177 --> 00:52:41,131
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. Can I take-- 
I found out that the hammer,

951
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:43,464
the dwarven thrower, 
is a versatile weapon.

952
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:45,251
MATT: Yeah, you can hold it 
with two hands if you'd like.

953
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:49,685
TRAVIS: With two hands, can I take a shot 
at his big stupid cranium?

954
00:52:49,685 --> 00:52:51,811
MATT: Yeah.

955
00:52:51,811 --> 00:52:54,532
TRAVIS: Okay. 
I want to squash the watermelon.

956
00:52:54,532 --> 00:52:55,926
MATT: All right, roll for it.

957
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:57,084
TRAVIS: Oh, reckless.

958
00:52:57,084 --> 00:52:58,625
MATT: Sure. 
You didn't need it, but go for it.

959
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:03,910
TRAVIS: Oh. Okay. Come on, 
crit on the dead skull-- natural 20!

960
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,929
MATT: Natural 20.

961
00:53:06,929 --> 00:53:14,554
(all laugh)

962
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:16,836
TRAVIS: It's like a beached whale.

963
00:53:16,836 --> 00:53:21,592
MATT: How do you want to do this, Grog?

964
00:53:21,592 --> 00:53:24,776
TRAVIS: I talk to the new 
dwarven thrower-hammer.

965
00:53:24,776 --> 00:53:29,780
"This is the beginning 
of a beautiful relationship!"

966
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:33,021
MATT: As you leap in the air, 
using the momentum of your leap,

967
00:53:33,021 --> 00:53:35,950
you smash the dwarven thrower down

968
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:40,393
onto the already partially-destroyed 
skull of Thordak's corpse,

969
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:44,397
the skull immediately caving inward 
with the force of the blow.

970
00:53:44,397 --> 00:53:46,323
As it hits and curves inward,

971
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:49,439
it releases this sudden burst 
of heavy ash into your face

972
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,630
that fills your lungs 
and burns your eyes, and you cough.

973
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,294
As you pull back, 
you try and wedge the hammer out,

974
00:53:55,294 --> 00:53:58,039
and as you do, you can see 
there is actual molten rock

975
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:00,775
still dripping 
off the outside of the hammer.

976
00:54:00,775 --> 00:54:03,896
Any sort of general normal 
unenchanted metal

977
00:54:03,896 --> 00:54:07,731
would probably be slightly bowing 
or melting in the presence of such heat.

978
00:54:07,731 --> 00:54:10,085
It looks like even in its dead state 
after a day of rest,

979
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:14,808
Thordak's corpse still maintained 
some sort of internal volcanic life

980
00:54:14,808 --> 00:54:18,313
as it slowly subsided, 
but the skull is destroyed.

981
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:21,905
You see bits of the upper palate 
just scattered like bone chunks

982
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:24,938
across the stonework of the floor,

983
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:27,493
stopping at the outside 
of one of the cages.

984
00:54:27,493 --> 00:54:30,052
Thordak's head is thoroughly destroyed.

985
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:31,866
LIAM: J-E-L-L-O.

986
00:54:31,866 --> 00:54:37,327
TRAVIS: Well played. I have another hit, 
but I want to get close enough for it.

987
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:40,798
With my bonus action, 
can I use the Boots of Feral Leaping

988
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:47,203
to make a horizontal leap 20 feet 
towards the remaining egg?

989
00:54:47,203 --> 00:54:49,523
PATRICK: Oh, the second egg 
did get destroyed.

990
00:54:49,523 --> 00:54:51,391
TRAVIS: Oh, they're all toast.

991
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,555
MATT: But you're welcome to, 
if you'd like.

992
00:54:53,555 --> 00:54:55,376
TRAVIS: I want to leap.

993
00:54:55,376 --> 00:55:00,653
LAURA: There's potentially corpses 
in those cages that could be something.

994
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:02,427
TRAVIS: I'm focused on the egg, 
all right?

995
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:03,804
LAURA: All right, sorry.

996
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:05,753
TRAVIS: I leap toward the eggs.

997
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:06,967
MATT: Okay, how far can you leap?

998
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:08,103
TRAVIS: 20 feet.

999
00:55:08,103 --> 00:55:09,030
MATT: All right.

1000
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:12,400
TRAVIS: And I have to make 
a DC 16 athletics check.

1001
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,657
MATT: Go for it.

1002
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:17,735
TRAVIS: 18.

1003
00:55:17,735 --> 00:55:21,525
MATT: All right. 
So you (leaping sound).

1004
00:55:21,525 --> 00:55:24,869
Not as far as you'd like, 
but that egg is staring you down.

1005
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:28,151
There is an unmoving 
baby dragon corpse that is--

1006
00:55:28,151 --> 00:55:30,885
you've got a date with your hammer.

1007
00:55:30,885 --> 00:55:31,836
TRAVIS: If I touch down,

1008
00:55:31,836 --> 00:55:35,126
may I throw the dwarven hammer 
at baby egg corpse?

1009
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:35,964
MATT: Go for it.

1010
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:37,117
(all laugh)

1011
00:55:37,117 --> 00:55:37,631
TRAVIS: Reckless.

1012
00:55:37,631 --> 00:55:39,131
MATT: Yeah, advantage. 
All your attacks are reckless, man.

1013
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:41,204
TRAVIS: Yes! Do it again! 
No, not quite.

1014
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,901
LAURA: That's okay, it's dead. 
It probably hits.

1015
00:55:43,997 --> 00:55:46,623
TRAVIS: 24.

1016
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:47,359
(all laugh)

1017
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,871
MATT: That hits. 
Go ahead and roll damage.

1018
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:51,072
TRAVIS: But this is just a d8 
because it's one-handed, right?

1019
00:55:51,072 --> 00:55:54,343
MATT: Yeah.

1020
00:55:54,377 --> 00:55:56,389
TRAVIS: 21--

1021
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:59,598
MATT: Plus an additional d8 
because you threw it.

1022
00:55:59,613 --> 00:56:01,061
LIAM: I don't know 
if we're going to kill Raishan,

1023
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:02,292
but we smoked those eggs.

1024
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:04,656
MATT: It's part of the enchantment of the hammer.

1025
00:56:04,748 --> 00:56:09,865
TRAVIS: I think it's just if it's a giant 
it's a 2d8.

1026
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:16,064
Yeah, you're right. Ranged attack.
So that's 26 total.

1027
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:17,364
MATT: 26 total.

1028
00:56:17,364 --> 00:56:27,498
The currently-lifeless limp corpse 
of this nearly-hatched primordial dragon--

1029
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:29,953
whatever this new entity was 
through the merger

1030
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,323
of the power of the soul anchor 
in the fire elemental plane

1031
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:36,537
and Thordak, the ancient red dragon, 
this remaining dragonkin--

1032
00:56:36,537 --> 00:56:40,798
is turned into red oatmeal

1033
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,887
against the table 
and the stone wall behind it.

1034
00:56:44,887 --> 00:56:50,824
TRAVIS: Yeah! Start the morning right. 
Come back from that, bitches!

1035
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,202
MATT: Well done, Grog.

1036
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:53,598
TRAVIS: No? We're not worried about that?

1037
00:56:53,612 --> 00:56:55,464
TALIESIN: No, you're good.

1038
00:56:55,464 --> 00:56:57,880
LAURA: Trinket's fighting every urge 
to go lick up the egg.

1039
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,529
(all laugh)

1040
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:02,101
TALIESIN: Oh, don't eat that. 
Don't eat that. No.

1041
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:03,918
LAURA: Come on, he's a bear.

1042
00:57:03,918 --> 00:57:04,525
TRAVIS: I'm good.

1043
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:09,554
MATT: You're good, all right. 
At the end of your turn--

1044
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:11,565
LIAM: That hall looks dangerous 
right where he is.

1045
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:12,788
MATT: Let's see here.

1046
00:57:12,788 --> 00:57:15,805
LIAM: There's two magical columns 
right there.

1047
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:17,311
TRAVIS: Those aren't even there at all.

1048
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,763
MATT: Scanlan, you feel a strange, 
warm sensation in your chest--

1049
00:57:19,763 --> 00:57:21,288
LAURA: Oh, you've been dispelled.

1050
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:23,871
MARISHA: Bitch.

1051
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:26,311
MATT: Also at the end of your turn, Grog, 
or as soon as your turn ends,

1052
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:33,651
you hear this (undead inhale) 
strange sucking breath-like sound.

1053
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:37,250
TRAVIS: Don't do it. Listen, 
I like you the way you are. Don't--

1054
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:43,583
MATT: (laughing) Make a perception check.

1055
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,046
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that's a fucking five.

1056
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:50,459
MATT: Five. You are talking fervently 
at your hammer. "Please--"

1057
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:51,957
TRAVIS: Please don't. Look, come on.

1058
00:57:51,957 --> 00:57:55,139
In my previous relationship, 
I've been burned before. Okay?

1059
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,676
I want to start fresh.

1060
00:57:56,676 --> 00:57:57,826
SAM: Then I also lose my--

1061
00:57:57,826 --> 00:58:01,059
TALIESIN: No, that's only-- 
well, that may be something else.

1062
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:03,539
That's Beacon of Hope. 
That's a different thing.

1063
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:04,675
MATT: That'll do it.

1064
00:58:04,675 --> 00:58:06,048
MARISHA: But is it still dispelled?

1065
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:07,332
TALIESIN: It depends 
on what she dispelled.

1066
00:58:07,332 --> 00:58:08,888
MATT: The time you're focusing 
on the hammer,

1067
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:10,244
you aren't paying attention 
to your surroundings

1068
00:58:10,244 --> 00:58:14,936
until you just see the shadows 
coalescing closer to you than you expect,

1069
00:58:14,936 --> 00:58:20,375
and by the time you look up, you watch 
as two black smoked, wraith-like entities

1070
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:24,963
that had slowly pulled themselves 
out of the two cages on the sides

1071
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:30,021
have shifted beside and lashed out at you.

1072
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:32,211
TRAVIS: (shrieks) I scream 
like I'm in a haunted house.

1073
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:35,402
(all laugh)

1074
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:37,405
SAM: You are in a haunted house.

1075
00:58:37,405 --> 00:58:40,019
MARISHA: Yeah, I was just going to say, 
I've seen that. That's legit.

1076
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:42,656
TRAVIS: I jump like a bitch.

1077
00:58:42,656 --> 00:58:47,894
The Boots of Feral Leaping 
are nothing, y'all.

1078
00:58:47,894 --> 00:58:51,381
MARISHA: Halloween Horror Nights 
is only fun when watching him.

1079
00:58:51,381 --> 00:58:52,783
MATT: 19 to hit.

1080
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:54,291
TRAVIS: Oh, that hits.

1081
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:57,425
MATT: They have advantage against you.
I forgot.

1082
00:58:57,425 --> 00:59:01,951
So 19 and the other hit is two and a 22.

1083
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:02,868
TRAVIS: Both hit.

1084
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:10,236
MATT: So both hit you. All righty. 
You suffer

1085
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:13,805
21 points of necrotic damage 
from the first hit.

1086
00:59:13,805 --> 00:59:15,797
TRAVIS: Necrotic, huh?

1087
00:59:15,797 --> 00:59:19,095
SAM: You don't have anything against that.

1088
00:59:19,095 --> 00:59:24,516
TRAVIS: I'm going to Forrest Gump 
up this bitch. Real quick.

1089
00:59:24,516 --> 00:59:26,612
MATT: And 20 points of necrotic damage, 
so a total of?

1090
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:27,788
TRAVIS: 42.

1091
00:59:27,788 --> 00:59:29,597
MATT: 41 points of necrotic damage.

1092
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:30,913
TRAVIS: 41, 21 and 20.

1093
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:32,601
MATT: I need you to make 
two constitution saving throws.

1094
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:36,491
PATRICK: Which I think 
we have advantage on right now.

1095
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,443
TRAVIS: Is this a saving throw 
or just a constitution--

1096
00:59:38,443 --> 00:59:40,206
LAURA: Oh yeah. Well, wisdom.

1097
00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:42,946
MATT: You have advantage on wisdom. 
This is a constitution save.

1098
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,216
PATRICK: It was from the Hero's Feast.

1099
00:59:45,216 --> 00:59:46,605
MATT: Hero's Feast isn't constitution, 
it's wisdom.

1100
00:59:46,605 --> 00:59:48,025
PATRICK: Okay, sorry.

1101
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:49,325
TRAVIS: Minus two to everything, right?

1102
00:59:49,325 --> 00:59:52,847
MATT: You're at minus two to everything.

1103
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:55,632
TRAVIS: That is 
a three minus two equals one.

1104
00:59:55,632 --> 00:59:57,187
LIAM: It's not a natural one, though.

1105
00:59:57,187 --> 00:59:59,919
MATT: And the second hit?

1106
00:59:59,919 --> 01:00:01,323
TRAVIS: Is an 11.

1107
01:00:01,323 --> 01:00:04,371
MATT: All right. So your maximum hit 
points are also reduced by 41

1108
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:07,811
as both of the wraiths drain the life 
force out of you,

1109
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:11,448
their claws rake through your body 
like it's nothing, and as they pull back,

1110
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:14,257
you feel the breath sucked from your 
lungs,

1111
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:16,090
and you instinctually cough for a second,

1112
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,256
almost stumbling to one knee, 
as both the wraiths chuckle

1113
01:00:18,256 --> 01:00:20,483
at the side of your face.

1114
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,458
LAURA: I feel like we aren't taking this 
seriously enough, you guys.

1115
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:24,962
'Cause I feel like this could be really 
bad, right now.

1116
01:00:24,962 --> 01:00:26,462
SAM: No, no, we made some good omelets.

1117
01:00:26,462 --> 01:00:28,344
LAURA: Oh my god.

1118
01:00:28,344 --> 01:00:29,397
MATT: All righty. Kerr.

1119
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:30,777
SAM: This is important work.

1120
01:00:30,777 --> 01:00:31,890
LIAM: The room was empty.

1121
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:32,995
MATT: You watched this happen.

1122
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:34,024
PATRICK: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1123
01:00:34,024 --> 01:00:37,626
MATT: Over here, as well as seeing the fog cloud 
suddenly fill the opposite side of the cavern,

1124
01:00:37,626 --> 01:00:42,070
and for a brief moment, you're-- 
you feel like you're a little bit

1125
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:45,522
out of your element, but you click in 
and your combat sense kicks in.

1126
01:00:45,522 --> 01:00:46,964
What do you want to do?

1127
01:00:46,964 --> 01:00:53,105
PATRICK: This is my game, right there. 
Horrible things from beyond the grave. Plus--

1128
01:00:53,105 --> 01:00:55,423
MARISHA: What up, paladin!

1129
01:00:55,423 --> 01:01:00,419
PATRICK: -- my new boyfriend is in a 
bad way, so.

1130
01:01:00,419 --> 01:01:03,526
TRAVIS: That's me. This guy.

1131
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,112
SAM: I missed one episode.

1132
01:01:05,112 --> 01:01:08,138
TRAVIS: Total Kerr-bear.

1133
01:01:08,138 --> 01:01:10,141
PATRICK: I've got movement of 30, that'll 
get me up there?

1134
01:01:10,141 --> 01:01:12,040
LIAM: Play-date!

1135
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,941
MATT: Yeah. You have five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 
you can get right--

1136
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:20,213
you can go 30 and get right next to 
both of them, if you'd like.

1137
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:23,055
PATRICK: There's probably advantages 
to that.

1138
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,076
MATT: Up to you. Doesn't matter.

1139
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:25,159
TALIESIN: There's advantages to both.

1140
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:26,902
TALIESIN and MARISHA: There's 
advantages to both.

1141
01:01:26,902 --> 01:01:28,806
(all laugh)

1142
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:35,262
PATRICK: I will make one attack, the one 
closer to me for lack of a better choice.

1143
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:38,324
MATT: Go for it.

1144
01:01:38,324 --> 01:01:45,102
PATRICK: 25.

1145
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:47,230
MATT: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1146
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:50,619
PATRICK: Okay, now, I'm not going out on 
a limb here thinking

1147
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:52,341
that this is an undead creature?

1148
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:56,135
MATT: This-- in your time, and you've 
come across quite a few undead creatures,

1149
01:01:56,135 --> 01:01:58,700
based on what you've walked through in this 
endeavor? You--

1150
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,351
while he did not see it, you watched these 
things rise out of the pile of corpses

1151
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,967
that are jammed at the bottom of 
each of these small cages.

1152
01:02:04,967 --> 01:02:07,430
You have a pretty good sense that 
these are undead.

1153
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:12,079
PATRICK: I misjudged the scale before, I 
thought my Divine Sense was big enough

1154
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,655
to cover this whole area.

1155
01:02:13,655 --> 01:02:15,211
MATT: Right.

1156
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:21,313
PATRICK: So I am going to use my 
paladin ability,

1157
01:02:21,313 --> 01:02:31,017
and I'm going to burn a first-level spell 
slot for my special paladin ability.

1158
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:32,375
MATT: Divine Smite?

1159
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,713
PATRICK: Yes, Divine Smite.

1160
01:02:33,713 --> 01:02:36,993
MATT: All righty. So that is 2d8--

1161
01:02:36,993 --> 01:02:39,279
PATRICK: Plus a d8 because they're undead.

1162
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:41,141
MATT: Undead, so plus 3d8 to your 
attack damage.

1163
01:02:41,141 --> 01:02:42,269
MARISHA: Oh, hell yeah.

1164
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:46,591
PATRICK: Yeah, so.

1165
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:47,787
TRAVIS: Dammit.

1166
01:02:47,787 --> 01:03:09,095
PATRICK: Four, and then another 11 is 15 
plus one more is... 31 radiant damage.

1167
01:03:09,095 --> 01:03:10,543
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

1168
01:03:10,543 --> 01:03:13,861
MATT: Ooh. So as you rush in--

1169
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:15,895
LIAM: But he's only seventh-level!

1170
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:19,008
MATT: From your perspective, Keyleth, 
you watch as this flash of light,

1171
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:23,790
and from thin air you watch armored 
Kerrek just streak down with his

1172
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:28,654
glowing-headed warhammer, and slamming 
the side of this wraith-like entity.

1173
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:32,128
As it hits, you watch as the creature 
turns, the radiant energy just consuming

1174
01:03:32,128 --> 01:03:37,561
part of its torso in the blast, and it 
shrieks out in pain as the radiant energy

1175
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:42,134
tends to burn the side of its undead form 
with a secondary flash as the divine

1176
01:03:42,134 --> 01:03:48,828
energy bursts outward. That-- 
you watched the wraith go from eager and

1177
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:52,242
smooth to looking like it's shimmering in 
place and its form is

1178
01:03:52,465 --> 01:03:56,305
starting to shake and hold itself present.

1179
01:03:56,305 --> 01:03:59,319
MARISHA: Keyleth just says, 
"I've never seen a gardener do that."

1180
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:02,237
(all laugh)

1181
01:04:02,237 --> 01:04:04,041
TALIESIN: Landscaper.

1182
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:04,558
MARISHA: (laughs) Landscaper.

1183
01:04:04,558 --> 01:04:05,632
PATRICK: And I will take my second attack.

1184
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:06,251
MATT: Same one?

1185
01:04:06,251 --> 01:04:07,185
PATRICK: Yeah.

1186
01:04:07,185 --> 01:04:08,671
MATT: All right, go for it.

1187
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:10,113
TALIESIN: Jesus.

1188
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:14,487
PATRICK: That is not as good. Now, if I'm 
coming in invisible,

1189
01:04:14,487 --> 01:04:16,461
do I get advantage due to surprise?

1190
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:17,647
MATT: On the first strike you 
would've, yes.

1191
01:04:17,647 --> 01:04:21,745
PATRICK: Only the first, okay. 
So this is a 17.

1192
01:04:21,745 --> 01:04:23,134
MATT: 17 still hits.

1193
01:04:23,134 --> 01:04:27,627
PATRICK: Yay. And I will burn another 
spell slot.

1194
01:04:27,627 --> 01:04:28,716
MATT: Go for it.

1195
01:04:28,716 --> 01:04:30,222
PATRICK: I don't want these 
hanging around.

1196
01:04:30,222 --> 01:04:34,691
MATT: So weapon damage plus 3d8.

1197
01:04:34,691 --> 01:04:36,147
LIAM: Divern Smert!

1198
01:04:36,147 --> 01:04:49,636
PATRICK: Eight... 16-- oh! um. 16 plus 13, 
somebody help out the English major.

1199
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,640
MATT: 29.

1200
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,574
LIAM: Oh, good roll.

1201
01:04:54,574 --> 01:04:59,128
PATRICK: And 35. And, just to let 
you know, the Dusk Hammer also

1202
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:03,660
gives me plus 1d8 against undead. 
So I'm taking that extra one too.

1203
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,087
So those of you at home see 
I'm not fucking around.

1204
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:09,600
MATT: Yeah, it's actually the ability of 
the weapon. Okay, so.

1205
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,629
PATRICK: 35 radiant.

1206
01:05:12,629 --> 01:05:13,833
SAM: Rothfuss.

1207
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:14,578
MATT: Nice.

1208
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:15,753
SAM: OP.

1209
01:05:15,753 --> 01:05:17,096
PATRICK: That's how we do at level 
seven, folks.

1210
01:05:17,096 --> 01:05:21,032
(all laugh)

1211
01:05:21,032 --> 01:05:24,317
MATT: As the second strike, using 
the momentum of the first swing,

1212
01:05:24,317 --> 01:05:26,865
you pull back and backhand it right 
in the face.

1213
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:30,742
As it cuts clean through with no 
resistance, the wraith seems to scatter,

1214
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:36,381
and the shadow reforms in the space 
it was, but barely. It's like--

1215
01:05:36,381 --> 01:05:38,680
PATRICK: Oh, you're kidding me.

1216
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,979
MATT: You're watching as part of it is 
flickering and bits of shadow

1217
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,587
are dripping and disappearing 
into the stonework behind,

1218
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:47,147
and its original kind of chuckling 
evil hungry visage is now

1219
01:05:47,147 --> 01:05:52,481
this fearful "oh shit" look 
on its spectral, skeletal face.

1220
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:55,792
TRAVIS: (singing) My boyfriend's back and 
you're going to be in trouble.

1221
01:05:55,792 --> 01:06:00,391
ALL: (singing with terrible harmonizing) 
Hey-na hey-na my boyfriend's back.

1222
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,037
(all laugh)

1223
01:06:02,037 --> 01:06:03,604
MATT: That got weird.

1224
01:06:03,604 --> 01:06:05,656
LAURA: That was like the Addams Family 
version of 'My Boyfriend's Back'.

1225
01:06:05,656 --> 01:06:07,340
TALIESIN: I am so pleased that 
got so awful.

1226
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,914
MATT: Really terrible.

1227
01:06:08,914 --> 01:06:10,886
TRAVIS: Somebody's cat at home just died. 
That was awful.

1228
01:06:10,886 --> 01:06:12,696
MARISHA: Just exploded.

1229
01:06:12,696 --> 01:06:15,427
TALIESIN: I might get my socks back, 
I'm very excited.

1230
01:06:15,427 --> 01:06:16,645
MATT: That ends Kerrek's turn--

1231
01:06:16,645 --> 01:06:19,689
MARISHA: They have only five hit points. 
We know this. Kitten damage.

1232
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:24,536
PATRICK: When Invisibility goes off, 
is my displacer cloak still in effect?

1233
01:06:24,536 --> 01:06:26,300
Do those things layer or--

1234
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,605
MATT: Yeah, they're still in effect.

1235
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:28,569
PATRICK: Okay.

1236
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:30,158
MATT: You have three things you could 
attune to, and so--

1237
01:06:30,158 --> 01:06:31,838
PATRICK: Right.

1238
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:33,568
MATT: While the ring is no longer 
invisible and--

1239
01:06:33,568 --> 01:06:34,851
PATRICK: I know that'll be out for 
a while.

1240
01:06:34,851 --> 01:06:36,866
MATT: That's out for a while, 
but the cloak is still in effect,

1241
01:06:36,866 --> 01:06:37,966
and your hammer is still in effect.

1242
01:06:37,966 --> 01:06:38,816
PATRICK: Okay.

1243
01:06:38,816 --> 01:06:41,868
LIAM: The way that cloak goes is they're 
at disadvantage if they hit you once,

1244
01:06:41,868 --> 01:06:43,785
then it goes away until the start of your 
next round.

1245
01:06:43,785 --> 01:06:44,732
PATRICK: Next turn.

1246
01:06:44,732 --> 01:06:45,824
LIAM: It keeps resetting.

1247
01:06:45,824 --> 01:06:48,776
PATRICK: I was mostly wondering, 
if I was invisible and displaced,

1248
01:06:48,776 --> 01:06:51,557
if they can detect invisible do they see 
me displaced?

1249
01:06:51,557 --> 01:06:53,128
But let's not worry about that until it 
becomes an issue.

1250
01:06:53,128 --> 01:06:55,670
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

1251
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:58,145
Well, in this circumstance, since you're 
no longer,

1252
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:00,670
since you are visible for the foreseeable 
future, it won't make any difference.

1253
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:01,740
PATRICK: Okay.

1254
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,605
MATT: But if you were invisible, 
the invisibility would take over,

1255
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:06,251
they'd have disadvantage against 
attacking you anyway,

1256
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:07,939
but they'd have to know where 
you were to even try

1257
01:07:07,939 --> 01:07:09,052
and make an attack, is how it would work.

1258
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:09,790
PATRICK: Okay.

1259
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,297
TALIESIN: Just somebody somewhere is 
dropping the bass.

1260
01:07:11,297 --> 01:07:22,136
MATT: Okay. So ending Kerr's turn... 
Pike feels--

1261
01:07:22,136 --> 01:07:23,513
SAM: Oh shit.

1262
01:07:23,513 --> 01:07:25,952
MATT: A warm sensation within her chest, 
a familiar one.

1263
01:07:25,952 --> 01:07:30,393
SAM: Oh boy.

1264
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:31,436
MATT: Let's see here.

1265
01:07:31,436 --> 01:07:33,825
SAM: What just got dispelled?

1266
01:07:33,825 --> 01:07:34,839
LAURA: Probably the feast.

1267
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:35,874
LIAM: Maybe.

1268
01:07:35,874 --> 01:07:36,814
LAURA: That's what happened before.

1269
01:07:36,814 --> 01:07:37,728
MATT: So that's Kima's turn.

1270
01:07:37,728 --> 01:07:39,194
LAURA: And the Beacon of Hope.

1271
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:43,434
MATT: Kima's currently seeing these wraith-
like entities start rushing into the room.

1272
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:44,990
One two three four five...

1273
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:47,179
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, this is her wheelhouse.

1274
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:49,131
MATT: She--

1275
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,932
LAURA: Oh yeah, good thing we brought Kima.

1276
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:54,852
MATT: -- movement-wise can't quite get 
all the way up to where they are now,

1277
01:07:54,852 --> 01:08:05,353
but she gets her hammer at the ready, and 
Kima's going to go ahead and... let's see.

1278
01:08:05,353 --> 01:08:07,178
LIAM: Oh, we got three paladins.

1279
01:08:07,178 --> 01:08:16,723
MATT: She's going to go ahead and cast 
Crusader's Mantle on herself.

1280
01:08:16,723 --> 01:08:18,514
TRAVIS: What was it? Crusader's Mantle?

1281
01:08:18,514 --> 01:08:21,277
MATT: Crusader's Mantle is the ability.

1282
01:08:21,277 --> 01:08:31,111
While she maintains concentration 
on it-- actually, you know what?

1283
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:34,293
No, I take that back. She's going to cast 
Aura of Vitality,

1284
01:08:34,293 --> 01:08:38,262
which means she can use her bonus action to 
heal an ally within 30 feet for 2d6 damage.

1285
01:08:38,262 --> 01:08:39,901
LAURA: Nice.

1286
01:08:39,901 --> 01:08:44,112
MATT: Um, so she casts that on herself. 
She's going to-- seeing you damaged, Grog--

1287
01:08:44,112 --> 01:08:45,268
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1288
01:08:45,268 --> 01:08:48,024
MATT: -- she's going to use her bonus 
action to attempt to heal you 2d6,

1289
01:08:48,024 --> 01:08:51,824
however, your maximum hit points have 
been lowered, so it has no effect on you,

1290
01:08:51,824 --> 01:08:55,048
and she realizes this as she reaches out 
and, "Grog!"

1291
01:08:55,048 --> 01:09:00,173
This bit of divine energy streaks from her hand, 
hits you, and seems to just peter out on impact.

1292
01:09:00,173 --> 01:09:06,513
"Shit." And she steels herself with her weapon, 
getting ready for the next round of onslaught.

1293
01:09:06,513 --> 01:09:09,496
Finishing Kima's turn, it is now Allura's turn.

1294
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:13,582
PATRICK: Luckily, though, because of Pike's spell, 
the damage you didn't heal was maximum.

1295
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:14,834
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good.

1296
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:16,248
LIAM: (laughs)

1297
01:09:16,248 --> 01:09:16,866
LAURA: Yeah.

1298
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,080
SAM: Well that's just math.

1299
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,236
LAURA: I didn't follow any of that.

1300
01:09:19,236 --> 01:09:20,670
LIAM: Silver lining, silver lining.

1301
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:22,518
TRAVIS: I replied in a positive way 
because I didn't know any better.

1302
01:09:22,518 --> 01:09:24,077
LAURA: (laughs)

1303
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:27,867
TALIESIN: We're probably going to want to 
destroy those cages, by the way.

1304
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:28,541
MATT: Okay.

1305
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:30,002
MARISHA: Destroy them?

1306
01:09:30,002 --> 01:09:31,494
TALIESIN: I think that we're going to get 
more wraiths.

1307
01:09:31,494 --> 01:09:32,774
MARISHA: Just coming out--

1308
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,098
LIAM: Did they come out of the cages?

1309
01:09:34,098 --> 01:09:37,474
PATRICK: They came out of the corpses in the-- 
I think there's only one corpse in each cage.

1310
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:39,113
LIAM: I think they're like gauntlet 
generators and they're just like--

1311
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,632
TALIESIN: Quick point of order--

1312
01:09:40,632 --> 01:09:41,313
MATT: Yes?

1313
01:09:41,313 --> 01:09:41,840
MARISHA: Spawners.

1314
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,589
TALIESIN: Is there like corpse soup in 
those cages, or is it one corpse per cage?

1315
01:09:45,589 --> 01:09:48,352
MATT: You can't really see from your 
perspective this far away.

1316
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:49,373
TALIESIN: Well, fair.

1317
01:09:49,373 --> 01:09:50,688
PATRICK: I wondered that same thing.

1318
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,316
(all laugh)

1319
01:09:52,316 --> 01:09:54,584
MATT: For the sake of paying attention, 
go ahead and make a perception check.

1320
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:55,847
PATRICK: Okay.

1321
01:09:55,847 --> 01:09:58,757
TALIESIN: I'm heading that way anyway, so.

1322
01:09:58,757 --> 01:09:59,567
PATRICK: 11-ish.

1323
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:02,784
MATT: 11. It's hard to tell in the low 
light from the candelabra.

1324
01:10:02,784 --> 01:10:10,171
It does look like, from the view here, there's 
at least two corpses in one of the cages.

1325
01:10:10,171 --> 01:10:14,561
Like a pile. There's one that's slumped 
forward, but you can see more than two legs.

1326
01:10:14,561 --> 01:10:17,997
MARISHA: Total spawn location.

1327
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:22,951
MATT: All right, so for Allura's turn 
she is going to--

1328
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:25,688
PATRICK: My god, was that the Gauntlet?

1329
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,940
MATT: --walk away from this area, Kima's 
got this, she steps over to this side,

1330
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:32,287
knowing that with the dog barking off to 
the side, that's definitely a sign

1331
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:35,074
that the dragon's coming from 
this direction.

1332
01:10:35,074 --> 01:10:42,533
She pulls her hood back and she will cast-- 
she's actually going to hold her action.

1333
01:10:42,533 --> 01:10:48,397
She's going to begin casting-- 
what would be a good one for this one?

1334
01:10:48,397 --> 01:10:58,382
She's going to begin casting Disintegrate 
once something attempts to move by.

1335
01:10:58,382 --> 01:10:59,458
LIAM: Savage.

1336
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:02,244
TRAVIS: Page out of Gilmore's book.

1337
01:11:02,244 --> 01:11:05,650
MATT: She's going to hold that as an action. 
All right, that brings us to Pike's turn.

1338
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:09,653
LAURA: (Pike voice) Yeah! Pike is going 
to cast--

1339
01:11:09,653 --> 01:11:10,409
TRAVIS: (Pike voice) Yeah!

1340
01:11:10,409 --> 01:11:11,576
LAURA: (Pike voice) Yeah!

1341
01:11:11,576 --> 01:11:12,437
LIAM: (Pike voice) I'm going to--

1342
01:11:12,437 --> 01:11:16,845
LAURA: (Pike voice) I'm going to-- Pike's 
going to cast Spiritual Weapon at level four.

1343
01:11:16,845 --> 01:11:18,277
MARISHA: She would totally do that.

1344
01:11:18,277 --> 01:11:19,014
LAURA: Right?

1345
01:11:19,014 --> 01:11:21,508
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1346
01:11:21,508 --> 01:11:23,268
LIAM: (Pike voice) In the shape of a--

1347
01:11:23,268 --> 01:11:25,929
MATT: She's putting it where?

1348
01:11:25,929 --> 01:11:29,344
LAURA: She's putting it right in the 
middle of the hallway.

1349
01:11:29,344 --> 01:11:31,180
MATT: There?

1350
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,463
LAURA: (Pike voice) Yeah.

1351
01:11:32,463 --> 01:11:37,082
MATT: All righty. Radiant sword appears 
in the center of the air.

1352
01:11:37,082 --> 01:11:38,501
SAM: Right behind me.

1353
01:11:38,501 --> 01:11:39,267
MATT: Right behind you, yeah.

1354
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:41,268
SAM: That's disconcerting.

1355
01:11:41,268 --> 01:11:43,049
LAURA: And then-- oh no, it's 
protection, Scanlan.

1356
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,201
SAM: Ah, okay.

1357
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:52,695
LAURA: And then she's going to use-- 
I guess that's only within ten feet.

1358
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:54,986
LIAM: Can she move?

1359
01:11:54,986 --> 01:12:02,785
LAURA: She's going to cast Light. Just to 
create a little bit of better vision.

1360
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:06,491
On that pile of rocks in the middle
of that.

1361
01:12:06,491 --> 01:12:07,410
MATT: Here?

1362
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,109
LAURA: Yeah.

1363
01:12:08,109 --> 01:12:10,140
MATT: Okay. So it's now a very bright--

1364
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:10,995
LAURA: Very bright!

1365
01:12:10,995 --> 01:12:14,445
MATT: -- area here now in the center of 
the hallway. All righty.

1366
01:12:14,445 --> 01:12:16,407
LAURA: I'm thinking maybe that'll help 
spot Raishan or something.

1367
01:12:16,407 --> 01:12:18,105
SAM: Sure, yeah, yeah, great--

1368
01:12:18,105 --> 01:12:20,043
MATT: That ends Pike's turn.

1369
01:12:20,043 --> 01:12:21,811
LAURA: Yeah.

1370
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:23,043
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

1371
01:12:23,043 --> 01:12:27,816
MARISHA: Okey-dokey. Whatcha doing?

1372
01:12:27,816 --> 01:12:30,809
TALIESIN: I was just trying to see if I could 
actually get, it was giving me a problem.

1373
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:33,354
MARISHA: To get it to work? Is that like 
a stalactite?

1374
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:34,313
PATRICK: Yeah.

1375
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:41,571
MARISHA: Interesting. Okay.

1376
01:12:41,571 --> 01:12:42,293
Keyleth is going to move a couple closer
to the wall, that's she's close--

1377
01:12:42,293 --> 01:12:43,167
MATT: This wall here?

1378
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:47,381
MARISHA: Yes. Two. Forward a little bit, 
going towards this tunnel.

1379
01:12:47,381 --> 01:12:48,070
Other way, other way.

1380
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:49,292
MATT: Other way.

1381
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:50,643
TRAVIS: Taliesin literally has the laser 
pointer.

1382
01:12:50,643 --> 01:12:52,573
MARISHA: Right there's good, that's good. 
Thank you. He is literally-- yeah.

1383
01:12:52,573 --> 01:13:00,590
Can I take my bonus action to do a 
perception check and see if I can sense

1384
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:06,573
any faint movements, fog being moved, 
pebbles being kicked?

1385
01:13:06,573 --> 01:13:08,624
MATT: Go for it.

1386
01:13:08,624 --> 01:13:11,603
LAURA: Gotta get a natural twenty on that.

1387
01:13:11,603 --> 01:13:13,102
MARISHA: 21.

1388
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:19,847
MATT: 21, okay. You can see the fog cloud, 
there is a heavy swirling in the cloud.

1389
01:13:19,847 --> 01:13:23,203
Looks like the fog, which is stationary
because the magical effect of the spell

1390
01:13:23,203 --> 01:13:27,595
creates it within a vicinity, the fog 
itself is (whooshing noises).

1391
01:13:27,595 --> 01:13:34,746
And occasionally you see what looks to be almost 
a big gust rapidly right at the outskirts of it.

1392
01:13:34,746 --> 01:13:37,276
MARISHA: I got you, bitch. All right.

1393
01:13:37,276 --> 01:13:44,876
I want to do right overtop of Scanlan's fog cloud, 
I want to do Faerie Fire. Glitterbomb.

1394
01:13:44,876 --> 01:13:46,424
MATT: Okay.

1395
01:13:46,424 --> 01:13:48,374
TRAVIS: Glitterbomb, yeah.

1396
01:13:48,374 --> 01:13:51,010
MARISHA: Glitterbomb.

1397
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:58,333
LAURA: Ugh, so annoying!

1398
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,403
TALIESIN: Oh god, it's everywhere.

1399
01:13:59,403 --> 01:14:01,054
LAURA: Jesus, we're never going to 
get it off!

1400
01:14:01,054 --> 01:14:02,995
MARISHA: Oh, man. I'm never going 
to Labyrinth again.

1401
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:04,616
TALIESIN: The next three bathtubs, 
glitter.

1402
01:14:04,616 --> 01:14:08,824
MATT: As you step out of the way, coming 
towards the fog cloud, you focus it

1403
01:14:08,824 --> 01:14:14,041
and you begin to bring your fingers across 
to deliver the incantation of Faerie Fire,

1404
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:18,567
and you watch a sudden slow blue spark of 
energy from inside the fog cloud.

1405
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:22,624
Just within, so it's like a little 
firework in a cloud, and when it happens,

1406
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:25,312
your spell fizzles at the tip of your 
fingers.

1407
01:14:25,312 --> 01:14:27,290
MARISHA: She fucking counterspelled me.

1408
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,699
SAM: Or legendaried it away.

1409
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:33,129
MARISHA: Or legendaried it away. 
She's in the fucking cloud, you guys.

1410
01:14:33,129 --> 01:14:34,995
SAM: Seems like it.

1411
01:14:34,995 --> 01:14:37,589
MARISHA: She's uploaded herself to 
the cloud.

1412
01:14:37,589 --> 01:14:41,073
LIAM: Druid's going country.

1413
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:43,423
MARISHA: Look. Never forget your roots.

1414
01:14:43,423 --> 01:14:46,305
TRAVIS: Going country!

1415
01:14:46,305 --> 01:14:48,558
TALIESIN: This is why you never upload 
anything to the cloud.

1416
01:14:48,558 --> 01:14:50,296
MATT: That brings us to the top 
of the round--

1417
01:14:50,296 --> 01:14:51,618
MARISHA: Yeah, the cloud could get hacked.

1418
01:14:51,618 --> 01:14:53,007
MATT: Vax, you're up.

1419
01:14:53,007 --> 01:14:57,518
MARISHA: It's a Black Mirror episode 
all of a sudden.

1420
01:14:57,518 --> 01:15:04,637
LIAM: Uh... shite. Are there still dead 
things with Groggy?

1421
01:15:04,637 --> 01:15:07,190
MATT: Correct, there are two of them 
flanking him currently.

1422
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,905
PATRICK: They're full of piss and vinegar.

1423
01:15:10,905 --> 01:15:14,303
LIAM: I'm going to attack them.

1424
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:19,073
I'm going to throw, but I'm going to go one 
dagger at the one above him.

1425
01:15:19,073 --> 01:15:20,105
MATT: This one?

1426
01:15:20,105 --> 01:15:20,869
LIAM: Yeah.

1427
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:21,609
MATT: All right.

1428
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:23,948
PATRICK: I think the one on this side is 
the one that's hurt most.

1429
01:15:23,948 --> 01:15:24,927
LIAM: On this side.

1430
01:15:24,927 --> 01:15:25,845
PATRICK: Yeah.

1431
01:15:25,845 --> 01:15:26,621
LIAM: Okay.

1432
01:15:26,621 --> 01:15:28,891
PATRICK: Yeah, that's the one that I 
roughed up real bad.

1433
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:29,938
LIAM: They were both roughed up real bad.

1434
01:15:29,938 --> 01:15:31,761
PATRICK: No, I hit one of them twice.

1435
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,194
MATT: He attacked one, one is 
untouched, one is flickering.

1436
01:15:34,194 --> 01:15:35,754
LIAM: So the one that's fucked up 
I will attack.

1437
01:15:35,754 --> 01:15:36,500
MATT: Okay.

1438
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:42,522
LIAM: So I'll throw one at that. 
That is good. That is a 31.

1439
01:15:42,522 --> 01:15:43,519
MATT: 31 hits.

1440
01:15:43,519 --> 01:15:45,064
PATRICK: Jeez.

1441
01:15:45,064 --> 01:15:46,058
TRAVIS: Pretty sure.

1442
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:52,917
LIAM: Yep. And I'll throw-- yeah, I'll 
throw another one at that one.

1443
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:53,907
MATT: Same one? The damaged one?

1444
01:15:53,907 --> 01:15:56,468
LIAM: Yeah.

1445
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:57,583
TRAVIS: Don't you want to see how 
much damage--

1446
01:15:57,583 --> 01:16:00,286
LIAM: That is 18. Can I wait and see how 
much damage I do?

1447
01:16:00,286 --> 01:16:01,285
MATT: Yeah, you can roll damage.

1448
01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:03,388
LIAM: Oh, then yeah, then I'll just 
attack one at a time,

1449
01:16:03,388 --> 01:16:12,877
I'll save that roll, though, for the next. 
So that is two plus eight is ten. Plus...

1450
01:16:12,877 --> 01:16:15,142
LAURA: Is there anything standing 
next to it?

1451
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:16,501
PATRICK: Yeah, a bunch of us.

1452
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:17,402
LIAM: Oh, Grog is, so it's flanked!

1453
01:16:17,402 --> 01:16:18,118
LAURA: So it's Sneak Attack!

1454
01:16:18,118 --> 01:16:20,119
LIAM: So it's Sneak Attack. Thanks, buddy.

1455
01:16:20,119 --> 01:16:21,429
LAURA: (whispering) I'm your sister.

1456
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:23,526
LIAM: You're also my buddy. 16.

1457
01:16:23,526 --> 01:16:26,330
MARISHA: You ain't my guy, friend.

1458
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:27,354
TALIESIN: You ain't my friend.

1459
01:16:27,354 --> 01:16:28,992
LIAM: I mean, it's got to be gone.

1460
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:29,973
LAURA: Whoa.

1461
01:16:29,973 --> 01:16:31,352
PATRICK: A bajillionty damage.

1462
01:16:31,352 --> 01:16:37,313
MATT: Yeah. It screams as its shadowed 
form is sent to join

1463
01:16:37,313 --> 01:16:42,876
the rest of the shadows in the room, 
unmoving, cold, and without life or undeath.

1464
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:44,684
LIAM: Okay, then the next two--

1465
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,890
MATT: Go for it.

1466
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:48,947
LIAM: The first one gets 18.

1467
01:16:48,947 --> 01:16:51,071
MATT: 18 hits. Vex, you're up next, 
by the way.

1468
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:55,077
LIAM: And then the second one is a 17.

1469
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,250
MATT: Also hits.

1470
01:16:56,250 --> 01:17:01,245
LIAM: Okay, so there it goes. I'm 
going to roll this one.

1471
01:17:01,245 --> 01:17:05,487
That's three plus eight is 11 plus the 
psychic damage has gone missing--

1472
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:08,987
MARISHA: Oh, fuck!

1473
01:17:08,987 --> 01:17:13,338
LIAM: Where is everything, where's 
my dice? 18 for the first.

1474
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:15,576
MATT: 18 damage.

1475
01:17:15,576 --> 01:17:17,741
LIAM: Eight for the second.

1476
01:17:17,741 --> 01:17:18,801
MATT: Eight damage?

1477
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:20,387
TRAVIS: Help me!

1478
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:22,770
MATT: Eight damage for the second one, 
without the attack modifier, right?

1479
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:23,837
LIAM: Without the attack?

1480
01:17:23,837 --> 01:17:26,045
MATT: So you don't add your dex, you don't 
add your dex bonus for the offhand attack.

1481
01:17:26,045 --> 01:17:30,386
LIAM: Oh, sorry, so, well if I rolled a 
two, okay. So then just two.

1482
01:17:30,386 --> 01:17:32,274
MATT: Okay.

1483
01:17:32,274 --> 01:17:33,591
LIAM: So 18 plus two, 20.

1484
01:17:33,591 --> 01:17:37,694
MATT: Okay. So both of the daggers, 
after destroying the one,

1485
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:40,440
slam into it, and the magical effect of
them manages to cause

1486
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,091
the form to shimmer slightly with the 
impact as the daggers pass through

1487
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,651
and then vanish on the opposite side 
of the room, returning to your side.

1488
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:51,219
The creature seems to have taken a few hits, but 
it's still strong and still swirling around Grog

1489
01:17:51,219 --> 01:17:55,463
as Grog's trying to find a way to get a bead 
on it so he can smack it with the hammer.

1490
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:58,680
LIAM: Okay. And I see that Grog is in 
pretty good hands with Kerrek,

1491
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,426
so I'm going to use my movement, 
which is hasted,

1492
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:08,072
to slide around this way and crouch 
ten feet in front of Keyleth. There.

1493
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:11,214
PATRICK: I think that's Keyleth you're 
moving. Oh no, I'm sorry.

1494
01:18:11,214 --> 01:18:14,086
LIAM: Ahead of Keyleth. Between 
Raishan and her.

1495
01:18:14,086 --> 01:18:15,117
MATT: Right there?

1496
01:18:15,117 --> 01:18:16,188
LIAM: Yeah.

1497
01:18:16,188 --> 01:18:18,317
MATT: Cool. All right. Vex, you're up.

1498
01:18:18,317 --> 01:18:19,638
SAM: We're just in a nice line.

1499
01:18:19,638 --> 01:18:21,057
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to--

1500
01:18:21,057 --> 01:18:26,785
I saw Keyleth say that she was in fog, so 
can I come around that corner and see her?

1501
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,511
MATT: Make a perception check.

1502
01:18:28,511 --> 01:18:30,356
MARISHA: Come on, come on, dragon sense and shit.

1503
01:18:30,356 --> 01:18:31,298
LIAM: Smell that dragon.

1504
01:18:31,298 --> 01:18:32,847
LIAM and TRAVIS: Yeah!

1505
01:18:32,847 --> 01:18:33,867
LAURA: 31.

1506
01:18:33,867 --> 01:18:34,952
MARISHA: Yeah!

1507
01:18:34,952 --> 01:18:41,608
MATT: You can see within the fog, as difficult 
as it is, a winged form swirling in there.

1508
01:18:41,608 --> 01:18:44,423
So you can make your attacks, it's still 
at a disadvantage because it's invisible,

1509
01:18:44,423 --> 01:18:46,467
but you can actually attack her 
right now, yes.

1510
01:18:46,467 --> 01:18:51,602
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to attack her, 
and I'm going to try to do Bramble Shot.

1511
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,971
MATT: Okay.

1512
01:18:53,971 --> 01:18:56,863
LAURA: With the Blazing Bowstring.

1513
01:18:56,863 --> 01:18:59,534
MATT: Okay. Before you do that, you still 
have Hunter's Mark up.

1514
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:00,585
LAURA: Oh yeah!

1515
01:19:00,585 --> 01:19:02,639
MATT: It's concentration.

1516
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:07,282
LAURA: Okay-- Bramble Shot isn't concentration, 
though. Can I shift it over to her?

1517
01:19:07,282 --> 01:19:09,503
MATT: You can, technically, yeah.

1518
01:19:09,503 --> 01:19:11,632
TRAVIS: Didn't your Hunter's Mark just 
disappear because she wasn't there?

1519
01:19:11,632 --> 01:19:12,939
LAURA: No, no, it was up.

1520
01:19:12,939 --> 01:19:15,564
MATT: It's still up. It's concentration, 
you just have to choose another target,

1521
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:16,665
use your bonus action to shift it over.

1522
01:19:16,665 --> 01:19:19,772
MARISHA: Because the illusion 
isn't considered a target?

1523
01:19:19,772 --> 01:19:23,855
LAURA: So once I-- it's like up. So once 
I knew where she was I could shift it.

1524
01:19:23,855 --> 01:19:25,322
LIAM: So sorry, since I'm new with 
Hunter's Mark,

1525
01:19:25,322 --> 01:19:28,085
later I can take my floating Hunter's 
Mark and bring it over to Raishan?

1526
01:19:28,085 --> 01:19:29,503
MATT: Eventually, once you have a 
bead on where she is, yes.

1527
01:19:29,503 --> 01:19:30,828
LIAM: Sweet.

1528
01:19:30,828 --> 01:19:32,197
LAURA: Okay.

1529
01:19:32,197 --> 01:19:34,152
MATT: So now you can take your attack. 
Go for it.

1530
01:19:34,152 --> 01:19:35,186
LAURA: Okay.

1531
01:19:35,186 --> 01:19:38,085
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies, come on.

1532
01:19:38,085 --> 01:19:39,036
LIAM: That's good.

1533
01:19:39,036 --> 01:19:42,271
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's a-- 
what is that? 30. Or something.

1534
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:42,927
LIAM: 32.

1535
01:19:42,927 --> 01:19:44,324
LAURA: 32.

1536
01:19:44,324 --> 01:19:45,575
MATT: Rolling with disadvantage, right?

1537
01:19:45,575 --> 01:19:47,545
LAURA: That was-- okay, that's--

1538
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:48,397
LIAM: That's okay.

1539
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:49,454
LAURA: 26?

1540
01:19:49,454 --> 01:19:52,651
MATT: 26, uh. 26 hits, yeah.

1541
01:19:52,651 --> 01:19:55,298
LAURA: Okay. So that's a Bramble Shot.

1542
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:56,571
TRAVIS: Just hits, or hits?

1543
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:57,599
MATT: It hits.

1544
01:19:57,599 --> 01:19:59,969
LAURA: Bramble Shot with the 
Blazing Bowstring.

1545
01:19:59,969 --> 01:20:07,855
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage. 
And then let me know what the saving throw is.

1546
01:20:07,855 --> 01:20:12,355
LAURA: Oh, wait. Let me 
(Scottish accent) get my d8s out here.

1547
01:20:12,355 --> 01:20:14,514
SAM: Wow, good Indian accent.

1548
01:20:14,514 --> 01:20:15,635
LAURA: Thank you.

1549
01:20:15,635 --> 01:20:19,071
(all laugh)

1550
01:20:23,689 --> 01:20:27,246
TRAVIS: She was at 24 last time.

1551
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:36,811
LAURA: 28 plus two lightning damage 
plus... six for Hunter's Mark.

1552
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:38,649
TRAVIS: 34.

1553
01:20:38,649 --> 01:20:45,453
LAURA: 34. Plus the blazing bowstring 
is nine. So 43.

1554
01:20:45,453 --> 01:20:46,691
TRAVIS: 43.

1555
01:20:46,691 --> 01:20:47,894
LAURA: Points of damage.

1556
01:20:47,894 --> 01:20:48,870
MATT: All right.

1557
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:50,398
LAURA: And then she has to do a strength 
saving throw of--

1558
01:20:50,398 --> 01:20:58,289
MATT: Well, first a concentration check. She 
succeeds, yeah, okay. And then what's the--

1559
01:20:58,289 --> 01:21:01,127
LAURA: And then a strength saving throw.

1560
01:21:01,127 --> 01:21:02,776
MATT: That is a nine.

1561
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:04,705
LAURA: Oh, so she's restrained!

1562
01:21:04,705 --> 01:21:05,822
MATT: She is.

1563
01:21:05,822 --> 01:21:07,374
MARISHA: Shut up! Shut up.

1564
01:21:07,374 --> 01:21:09,780
SAM: She's still invisible, though. 
She's still invisible, we can't see her.

1565
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:10,936
MARISHA: You badass!

1566
01:21:10,936 --> 01:21:12,814
LAURA: But she's restrained in the fog.

1567
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:13,853
MARISHA: You badass!

1568
01:21:13,853 --> 01:21:15,531
MATT: You hear a (growl and impact).

1569
01:21:15,531 --> 01:21:17,225
(All yell and cheer.)

1570
01:21:17,225 --> 01:21:20,206
MATT: You watch as some of the 
fog billows out.

1571
01:21:20,206 --> 01:21:24,304
You can still vaguely make out the form, 
as she (struggling sounds).

1572
01:21:24,304 --> 01:21:27,058
LAURA: All right. I'm going to pull out 
a sleep arrow

1573
01:21:27,058 --> 01:21:29,774
and do my second attack with a sleep 
arrow through the Blazing Bowstring.

1574
01:21:29,774 --> 01:21:32,015
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1575
01:21:32,015 --> 01:21:34,700
Invisible gives you disadvantage, but 
because she is currently restrained,

1576
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,853
that gives you advantage, so it's 
just a straight roll.

1577
01:21:36,853 --> 01:21:40,183
LAURA: Just straight? 26.

1578
01:21:40,183 --> 01:21:44,126
MATT: That hits.

1579
01:21:44,126 --> 01:21:47,351
LIAM: You will be a golden god if 
this works.

1580
01:21:47,351 --> 01:21:59,705
LAURA: 14 plus one lightning plus 
two for sneak attack... so four more.

1581
01:21:59,705 --> 01:22:03,310
And then, oh, and then a sleep arrow.

1582
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:04,320
MATT: What's the total damage?

1583
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,278
TRAVIS: 18.

1584
01:22:05,278 --> 01:22:06,136
MATT: 18.

1585
01:22:06,136 --> 01:22:07,201
LAURA: Thank you.

1586
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:07,864
MATT: Okay.

1587
01:22:07,864 --> 01:22:09,371
LAURA: Thanks, you math genius, you.

1588
01:22:09,371 --> 01:22:10,466
MARISHA: Do those arrows work 
like the spell?

1589
01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:14,539
MATT: She maintains concentration. 
So for the purposes of the spell...

1590
01:22:14,539 --> 01:22:20,542
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing)

1591
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:22,368
MARISHA: I know, I know.

1592
01:22:22,368 --> 01:22:24,414
MATT: Roll 5d8.

1593
01:22:24,414 --> 01:22:25,943
LAURA: 5d8?

1594
01:22:25,943 --> 01:22:27,287
MARISHA: Oh, I think you have to beat 
her hit points.

1595
01:22:27,287 --> 01:22:28,839
LIAM: Higher than her hit points, yeah.

1596
01:22:28,839 --> 01:22:29,619
MATT: Yep.

1597
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:30,820
LIAM: Well, that's--

1598
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,034
MARISHA: That's going to be tough.

1599
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:34,357
LIAM: Yeah.

1600
01:22:34,357 --> 01:22:37,033
MARISHA: But she's diseased. And whatnot.

1601
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:38,497
TRAVIS: She got that Hep C, y'all.

1602
01:22:38,497 --> 01:22:41,296
(all laugh)

1603
01:22:41,296 --> 01:22:42,066
LAURA: 18?

1604
01:22:42,066 --> 01:22:43,134
MATT: 18.

1605
01:22:43,134 --> 01:22:44,427
LIAM: No way.

1606
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:46,548
MATT: You fire the arrow, but you still 
hear thrashing about.

1607
01:22:46,548 --> 01:22:47,337
LAURA: Okay.

1608
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:48,206
MATT: It does not seem to be--

1609
01:22:48,206 --> 01:22:50,042
LAURA: Well, it was worth a try.

1610
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:52,585
TALIESIN: It was valiant.

1611
01:22:52,585 --> 01:22:54,452
MATT: All right. That ends--

1612
01:22:54,452 --> 01:22:59,254
LAURA: Oh, and then I'm going to use the rest of 
my move to duck around that corner and back up.

1613
01:22:59,254 --> 01:23:00,981
MATT: Duck around this corner here?

1614
01:23:00,981 --> 01:23:02,892
LAURA: Yeah.

1615
01:23:02,892 --> 01:23:04,109
MATT: That's as far as you can get 
right there.

1616
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:06,212
LAURA: I want to be behind that 
stalactite or whatever--

1617
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:07,231
MATT: There?

1618
01:23:07,231 --> 01:23:09,225
LAURA: Yeah. Mite. Stalagmite.

1619
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:10,567
MATT: Yeah, like mite.

1620
01:23:10,567 --> 01:23:11,741
LIAM: You might what?

1621
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:13,333
MATT: All right, cool.

1622
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:14,570
LAURA: I might hide behind 
that stalagmite.

1623
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:15,797
MATT: That ends your turn. 
Percy, you're up.

1624
01:23:15,797 --> 01:23:17,610
TALIESIN: Did I see this go down?

1625
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:19,007
MATT: You're over here watching the 
egg off in the distance,

1626
01:23:19,007 --> 01:23:21,507
and you watch her fire a couple arrows 
and then rush around the corner,

1627
01:23:21,507 --> 01:23:24,700
and you hear the slam into the ground.

1628
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,833
Though you can see the fog moving 
around and there's thrashing.

1629
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:30,572
If you wanted to try and attack something, 
you'd have to roll a perception check.

1630
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:35,409
TALIESIN: All right. I'm making my way 
along the wall anyway in that direction,

1631
01:23:35,409 --> 01:23:38,553
so while I'm walking I'm going to see if 
anything looks worth shooting at over there.

1632
01:23:38,553 --> 01:23:39,975
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1633
01:23:39,975 --> 01:23:47,858
TALIESIN: Perception check. Hey! Let's 
call that a 25.

1634
01:23:47,858 --> 01:23:52,950
MATT: 25, you can just make out the outline 
of a form thrashing within the fog cloud,

1635
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:56,308
so yes, I would allow you to take 
attacks, with disadvantage.

1636
01:23:56,308 --> 01:23:58,388
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Hex.

1637
01:23:58,388 --> 01:24:08,484
MATT: Okay.

1638
01:24:08,484 --> 01:24:11,514
TALIESIN: And she now has disadvantage 
on strength saving throws.

1639
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:13,331
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

1640
01:24:13,331 --> 01:24:14,942
PATRICK: (laughs) Nice.

1641
01:24:14,942 --> 01:24:16,696
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm being a dick.

1642
01:24:16,696 --> 01:24:20,265
MARISHA: Strength saving throws, 
hell yeah.

1643
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:23,492
TALIESIN: So I'm going to burn a grit 
to cancel out the disadvantage.

1644
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:25,625
MATT: Okay.

1645
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:28,684
TALIESIN: Better mark that 
like a clever person.

1646
01:24:28,684 --> 01:24:32,534
And I'm just going to try and 
take a shot and see what happens.

1647
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:33,726
MATT: All right.

1648
01:24:33,726 --> 01:24:41,841
TALIESIN: So this is with Bad News. 
That's a 21.

1649
01:24:41,841 --> 01:24:46,836
MATT: 21? Vanishes into the mist. 
Does not seem to have made an impact.

1650
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:48,710
TRAVIS: I think it's 23.

1651
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:50,087
LAURA: Really?

1652
01:24:50,087 --> 01:24:58,831
TALIESIN: One more shot. Oh, yeah. 29.

1653
01:24:58,831 --> 01:25:01,453
MATT: 29 does hit. That's 
with disadvantage?

1654
01:25:01,453 --> 01:25:04,077
TALIESIN: Yeah. No, that's with a 
grit to cancel out the disadvantage.

1655
01:25:04,077 --> 01:25:06,278
MATT: Oh, gotcha. Then yeah, 
that does hit.

1656
01:25:06,278 --> 01:25:08,986
TALIESIN: So, okay, I'm going to use that,

1657
01:25:08,986 --> 01:25:14,634
since it hit I'm also going to shove all 
six of my charges through that shot as well.

1658
01:25:14,634 --> 01:25:16,153
MATT: Okay, then.

1659
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:17,359
TALIESIN: For fun.

1660
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:20,259
PATRICK: Actually, does he have 
disadvantage because she's bound?

1661
01:25:20,259 --> 01:25:22,946
Didn't those cancel out when she attacked?

1662
01:25:22,946 --> 01:25:24,744
LAURA: She's invisible, though.

1663
01:25:24,744 --> 01:25:26,919
PATRICK: Invisible but restrained.

1664
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:30,490
MATT: Right, so you would've had... so 
it would've been just a straight attack.

1665
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:31,626
LIAM: So you don't need the grit.

1666
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,371
LAURA: So you don't need to burn 
the grit, that's great.

1667
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:34,640
TALIESIN: I'll get that back later, okay.

1668
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,086
MATT: Good call, thank you.

1669
01:25:36,086 --> 01:25:39,408
TALIESIN: So. Thank you, thank you, that's 
going to make life better later. So that's--

1670
01:25:39,408 --> 01:25:45,012
MATT: Just roll damage and then pump 6d6 
lightning damage from your cloak into the hit.

1671
01:25:45,012 --> 01:25:46,543
LAURA: Holy moly!

1672
01:25:46,543 --> 01:25:49,739
TALIESIN: So that's-- oh god, I got to get 
more dice, I didn't even think this through.

1673
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:52,410
MARISHA: Do you need d6s? I've got a line.

1674
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:54,923
TALIESIN: Sure.

1675
01:25:54,923 --> 01:25:56,249
MARISHA: Here's some d6s.

1676
01:25:56,249 --> 01:25:57,857
TALIESIN: I just need three more.

1677
01:25:57,857 --> 01:25:59,482
MARISHA: One two-three.

1678
01:25:59,482 --> 01:26:00,574
TRAVIS: Here's all of them.

1679
01:26:00,574 --> 01:26:01,609
MARISHA: Here's all of them.

1680
01:26:01,609 --> 01:26:08,617
TALIESIN: So 6d6 plus... d12s plus... one 
more 1d6 because there's some necro there.

1681
01:26:08,617 --> 01:26:09,833
MARISHA: Yeah.

1682
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:12,010
TALIESIN: Thank you. Okay. That'll do. 
Here we go.

1683
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:15,843
LIAM: Necro.

1684
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:19,870
TALIESIN: Oh wow. Okay. I'm going to 
make that the necro because that's fun.

1685
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:21,356
MARISHA: That's hot!

1686
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:25,039
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's pretty good. I 
wish I had your power to do that crazy.

1687
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:26,702
All right, let's see how we did.

1688
01:26:26,702 --> 01:26:28,443
LAURA: C'mon Percival!

1689
01:26:28,443 --> 01:26:29,951
TALIESIN: That's... hahaha.

1690
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:35,128
(all laugh)

1691
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:36,771
TRAVIS: The most random line-fillers.

1692
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:38,838
TALIESIN: 23 points of normal damage.

1693
01:26:38,838 --> 01:26:40,008
MATT: Okay.

1694
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:43,082
TALIESIN: 23 points of normal damage, 
six points of necrotic damage.

1695
01:26:43,082 --> 01:26:44,480
MATT: Okay.

1696
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:51,856
TALIESIN: And 25 points of 
lightning damage.

1697
01:26:51,856 --> 01:26:54,546
MATT: Nice, that's a total of 
54 points of damage.

1698
01:26:54,546 --> 01:26:58,094
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that felt good.

1699
01:26:58,094 --> 01:27:02,118
MATT: She still makes her save 
for her maintaining concentration.

1700
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:04,010
TALIESIN: Wow, all right.

1701
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,401
MARISHA: How?

1702
01:27:05,401 --> 01:27:06,904
MATT: Dragons have really high 
constitution.

1703
01:27:06,904 --> 01:27:09,037
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep moving my maximum 
move in that direction along the wall.

1704
01:27:09,037 --> 01:27:12,537
MATT: Dragons have high constitution. 
It's plus 14 modifier.

1705
01:27:12,537 --> 01:27:15,802
TALIESIN: If I can move any further I 
will, but that's--

1706
01:27:15,802 --> 01:27:19,276
MATT: You can move, from where you were? No, 
that's as far as you can go, unfortunately, yeah.

1707
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:25,685
TALIESIN: That's fine. I just call over 
the headpiece, "She's down and vulnerable!"

1708
01:27:25,685 --> 01:27:28,581
MATT: All right. As you finish your turn,

1709
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:34,215
you watch as the fog shifts and you hear 
(footsteps) and a voice retorts out,

1710
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:37,869
"Not as down and not as vulnerable 
as you think."

1711
01:27:37,869 --> 01:27:41,127
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

1712
01:27:41,127 --> 01:27:42,842
MATT: Backs up into the fog.

1713
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,245
MARISHA: Oh, jeez.

1714
01:27:44,245 --> 01:27:47,920
MATT: You just barely see, Scanlan, as it 
steps away, this form vanish into--

1715
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,821
well, you said you were holding your 
action for something?

1716
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:51,318
SAM: I was not holding my action. 
I thought about it.

1717
01:27:51,318 --> 01:27:52,789
MATT: That's right, that's right.

1718
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:56,741
So you watch the figure back away into the 
fog ever-so-slightly going (soft chanting).

1719
01:27:56,741 --> 01:27:58,467
LAURA: She's casting something.

1720
01:27:58,467 --> 01:28:02,503
TALIESIN: Did she-- even with disadvantage 
on her strength check on that one?

1721
01:28:02,503 --> 01:28:08,213
MATT: Hm? Well, she can't move anywhere, 
because she's restrained.

1722
01:28:08,213 --> 01:28:09,243
LAURA: Oh, she is still restrained?

1723
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:10,692
MATT: Correct. She can't move.

1724
01:28:10,692 --> 01:28:12,106
MARISHA: She's switching form?

1725
01:28:12,106 --> 01:28:13,086
LAURA: Oh.

1726
01:28:13,086 --> 01:28:14,151
SAM: She's still restrained?

1727
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:16,452
MATT: She's still restrained. For the 
item, what does it say?

1728
01:28:16,452 --> 01:28:19,918
Is it a saving throw at the end of the turn, 
or is it has to use an action to break free?

1729
01:28:19,918 --> 01:28:25,502
LAURA: Let me find out, because let's 
see. You wrote it, I mean.

1730
01:28:25,502 --> 01:28:27,274
MATT: I know, but I haven't looked 
at it in a while.

1731
01:28:27,274 --> 01:28:30,830
LAURA: The restrained target can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

1732
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:37,001
MATT: Okay, cool. So. So yes.

1733
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:40,925
LAURA: Oh, and it's a DC of 17. Not 16. 
I have it written down wrong.

1734
01:28:40,925 --> 01:28:45,728
MATT: Okay, that's fine, she still rolled 
poorly for that one.

1735
01:28:45,728 --> 01:28:54,508
As the face pulls back into the mist, you 
feel this shaking within the room

1736
01:28:54,508 --> 01:29:03,979
as the ceilings of the cavern begin to shift 
and form into what appear to be small rifts.

1737
01:29:03,979 --> 01:29:05,996
SAM: Oh shit. What's all that?

1738
01:29:05,996 --> 01:29:07,224
TRAVIS: The air conditioning?

1739
01:29:07,227 --> 01:29:08,736
SAM: Yeah, that's what it is. Central.

1740
01:29:08,736 --> 01:29:09,801
MARISHA: HVAC.

1741
01:29:09,801 --> 01:29:11,300
LAURA: Oh no. Oh no!

1742
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:17,954
MATT: You hear the sound of rocketing 
stone and flame

1743
01:29:18,172 --> 01:29:23,822
being pulled from a realm or plane 
beyond the material--

1744
01:29:23,911 --> 01:29:28,842
MARISHA: She's doing a Meteor Swarm. 
She's doing a Meteor Swarm!

1745
01:29:28,842 --> 01:29:30,018
LIAM: Final Fantasy.

1746
01:29:30,018 --> 01:29:31,305
LAURA: There's nowhere to take cover, 
is there?

1747
01:29:31,305 --> 01:29:32,673
MARISHA: Hold onto your butts.

1748
01:29:32,673 --> 01:29:34,133
LAURA: Hold onto your knickers!

1749
01:29:34,133 --> 01:29:37,272
MATT: One... two...

1750
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:40,129
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.

1751
01:29:40,129 --> 01:29:45,422
MATT: Actually, it would be two... 
three... four. All of you.

1752
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:47,657
TALIESIN: Four?

1753
01:29:47,657 --> 01:29:50,142
MARISHA: One day, I'll have that spell.

1754
01:29:50,142 --> 01:29:51,377
TALIESIN: Four?

1755
01:29:51,377 --> 01:29:53,596
LAURA: Scanlan even got hit? Scanlan 
got hit in there?

1756
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:54,787
SAM: I was on the edge of one of them.

1757
01:29:54,787 --> 01:29:55,988
LAURA: Ah, balls.

1758
01:29:55,988 --> 01:30:00,641
MATT: Yep, everybody got hit. 
So. I need everybody...

1759
01:30:00,641 --> 01:30:03,768
Go ahead and make a dexterity 
saving throw, please.

1760
01:30:03,768 --> 01:30:05,434
TRAVIS: Nobody can counter that 
or anything, hey?

1761
01:30:05,434 --> 01:30:11,557
LIAM: Natural 20!

1762
01:30:11,557 --> 01:30:14,775
PATRICK: Grog, you get a plus three 
from me.

1763
01:30:14,775 --> 01:30:17,808
TRAVIS: Oh, nice.

1764
01:30:17,808 --> 01:30:29,114
PATRICK: Who else is next to me there? Is 
she close enough to be within my aura?

1765
01:30:29,114 --> 01:30:32,982
MATT: Who, Kima?

1766
01:30:32,982 --> 01:30:34,481
PATRICK: Yes.

1767
01:30:34,481 --> 01:30:35,721
MATT: Kima has her own aura, thankfully.

1768
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:36,969
PATRICK: Okay.

1769
01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:38,549
MATT: She's a paladin as well.

1770
01:30:38,549 --> 01:30:40,399
PATRICK: Am I close enough to get hers?

1771
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,130
MATT: So it's ten feet, you guys are not 
close enough to affect each other, no.

1772
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:53,321
So you do not get to receive each other's 
bonus, unfortunately. All right. So. Scanlan.

1773
01:30:53,321 --> 01:30:54,835
SAM: Eight.

1774
01:30:54,835 --> 01:31:01,490
MATT: (laughs) Eight. Okay. You suffer... 
that's 118 points of damage.

1775
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:05,074
(Incredulous laughter.)

1776
01:31:05,074 --> 01:31:06,216
MATT: Bludgeoning--

1777
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:08,046
SAM: I'm immune to meteors.

1778
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:11,420
(all laugh)

1779
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:16,500
MATT: It's 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 
bludgeoning damage, and half as much on half.

1780
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:19,002
So yeah, so that's 118 points--

1781
01:31:19,002 --> 01:31:21,808
SAM: Tell me this: do I have-- how many 
hit points do I have,

1782
01:31:21,808 --> 01:31:25,879
because when she dispelled the Hero's 
Feast, do I lose those temporary hit points?

1783
01:31:25,879 --> 01:31:26,845
MATT: You do.

1784
01:31:26,845 --> 01:31:28,908
SAM: Okay. So... got it.

1785
01:31:28,908 --> 01:31:29,924
MARISHA: So you're unconscious, 
aren't you?

1786
01:31:29,924 --> 01:31:30,878
SAM: No.

1787
01:31:30,878 --> 01:31:31,744
TALIESIN: No.

1788
01:31:31,744 --> 01:31:32,461
MARISHA: No?

1789
01:31:32,461 --> 01:31:34,070
MATT: He's a hardy little gnome, man.

1790
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:35,250
LAURA: Wow, that's impressive.

1791
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,551
MATT: Percy.

1792
01:31:36,551 --> 01:31:39,698
TALIESIN: 18.

1793
01:31:39,698 --> 01:31:41,704
MATT: 18. You suffer 118 points of damage.

1794
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:45,343
TALIESIN: 19, I'm sorry, 19.

1795
01:31:45,343 --> 01:31:46,529
MATT: Still suffer it.

1796
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:48,938
TALIESIN: Okay. That's fine. 118.

1797
01:31:48,938 --> 01:31:52,887
SAM: When she dispelled things, did 
I also lose my Pike advantages things?

1798
01:31:52,887 --> 01:31:53,817
LAURA: The Beacon of Hope?

1799
01:31:53,817 --> 01:31:55,074
SAM: Beacon of Hope?

1800
01:31:55,074 --> 01:31:56,541
LAURA: Or was it just the one?

1801
01:31:56,541 --> 01:32:00,335
MATT: No. No, the only thing she dispelled was a 
single specific effect, which was the Hero's Feast.

1802
01:32:00,335 --> 01:32:01,953
MARISHA: So you have to pick an effect.

1803
01:32:01,953 --> 01:32:03,725
SAM: So you have to tell what you're 
dispelling? Okay.

1804
01:32:03,725 --> 01:32:04,887
MATT: You have to pick a singular effect.

1805
01:32:04,887 --> 01:32:06,433
MARISHA: Okay. That's good.

1806
01:32:06,433 --> 01:32:08,600
MATT: Yeah. And Raishan is well aware 
that you guys prepare with a Hero's Feast.

1807
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,990
SAM: Okay.

1808
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:11,369
MATT: Keyleth.

1809
01:32:11,369 --> 01:32:12,410
MARISHA: 24.

1810
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:17,160
MATT: 24. You suffer 59 points of damage.

1811
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:23,384
MARISHA: Okay, that's half. That's half. 
Nothing better. Don't you guys wish you were me?

1812
01:32:23,384 --> 01:32:25,243
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, yes.

1813
01:32:25,243 --> 01:32:27,641
TALIESIN: Really, we do. That's genuinely 
a thing.

1814
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:29,489
MARISHA: 54? 59?

1815
01:32:29,489 --> 01:32:30,890
MATT: 59 points.

1816
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:32,396
MARISHA: Okay.

1817
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:34,734
TALIESIN: I'm alive. Nice.

1818
01:32:34,734 --> 01:32:38,116
MATT: Oof.

1819
01:32:38,116 --> 01:32:42,998
LAURA: This is like instant run away 
(laughs). One spell she does.

1820
01:32:42,998 --> 01:32:45,307
MATT: Kima is already down, unconscious.

1821
01:32:45,307 --> 01:32:47,494
LAURA: No, Kima!

1822
01:32:47,494 --> 01:32:50,426
MATT: Sorry, Allura is down, 
Kima is still up.

1823
01:32:50,426 --> 01:32:52,429
PATRICK: Christ.

1824
01:32:52,429 --> 01:32:53,778
MARISHA: I'm at 57 hit points.

1825
01:32:53,778 --> 01:32:55,209
MATT: Kerrek.

1826
01:32:55,209 --> 01:32:57,389
TRAVIS: She started to cast.

1827
01:32:57,389 --> 01:32:59,117
PATRICK: Just no, not even close.

1828
01:32:59,117 --> 01:33:00,998
LAURA: That's right, wasn't she 
saving her action?

1829
01:33:00,998 --> 01:33:02,996
TRAVIS: Allura, wasn't she 
preparing Disintegrate?

1830
01:33:02,996 --> 01:33:04,826
SAM: Yeah, until she saw something.

1831
01:33:04,826 --> 01:33:09,179
MATT: She never saw something come 
through. So that--

1832
01:33:09,179 --> 01:33:11,629
SAM: Is that like a hand-grenade where 
you fall and--

1833
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:14,583
TRAVIS: And it goes ting-ting-ting 
(explosion).

1834
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:15,609
MATT: Not so much.

1835
01:33:15,609 --> 01:33:18,680
LAURA: I'm disintegrated.

1836
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:19,667
PATRICK: Six.

1837
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:21,926
MATT: Six. Kerrek, you suffer 118 
points of damage.

1838
01:33:21,926 --> 01:33:24,135
PATRICK: Yes I do.

1839
01:33:24,135 --> 01:33:25,237
SAM: What's he down--

1840
01:33:25,237 --> 01:33:26,317
MATT: Kerrek is unconscious.

1841
01:33:26,317 --> 01:33:27,284
PATRICK: I am unconscious.

1842
01:33:27,284 --> 01:33:28,792
SAM: I mean, how far down?

1843
01:33:28,792 --> 01:33:30,119
LIAM: There is no negative, he's 
just down.

1844
01:33:30,119 --> 01:33:31,240
LAURA: No, no, it's not like that.

1845
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,595
SAM: It's not like past--

1846
01:33:32,595 --> 01:33:33,852
LIAM: You have to surpass your total--

1847
01:33:33,852 --> 01:33:34,735
SAM: I know, that's what I'm asking.

1848
01:33:34,735 --> 01:33:36,735
PATRICK: I'm not that bad, not that bad.

1849
01:33:36,735 --> 01:33:38,856
TALIESIN: The world's cruel.

1850
01:33:38,856 --> 01:33:40,261
MATT: All right. Next up is--

1851
01:33:40,261 --> 01:33:41,653
LIAM: Natural 20.

1852
01:33:41,653 --> 01:33:43,779
MATT: So zero damage to Vax.

1853
01:33:43,779 --> 01:33:45,509
LIAM: Hip hop hippity hop.

1854
01:33:45,509 --> 01:33:46,508
LAURA: 22.

1855
01:33:46,508 --> 01:33:47,386
PATRICK: You have Evasion?

1856
01:33:47,386 --> 01:33:47,938
LIAM: Yep.

1857
01:33:47,938 --> 01:33:49,714
MATT: 22, you suffer 59 points of damage.

1858
01:33:49,714 --> 01:33:51,334
PATRICK: I got so used to playing a 
rogue, nothing can stick on you.

1859
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,702
MATT: The DC is 22 for the spell.

1860
01:33:52,702 --> 01:33:53,725
LAURA: Oh my god.

1861
01:33:53,725 --> 01:33:54,583
MARISHA: 22, wow.

1862
01:33:54,583 --> 01:34:01,414
LAURA: Trinket got three. But he is, he is 
resistant to magical bludgeoning damage.

1863
01:34:01,414 --> 01:34:03,878
SAM: Is that true?

1864
01:34:03,878 --> 01:34:05,676
LAURA: Or bludgeoning damage, rather.

1865
01:34:05,676 --> 01:34:07,184
TALIESIN: Wait a minute. Is this 
magical damage?

1866
01:34:07,184 --> 01:34:08,700
MATT: Yes?

1867
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,879
TALIESIN: Does Cabal's absorb it?

1868
01:34:10,879 --> 01:34:12,084
MATT: What's it say for Cabal?

1869
01:34:12,084 --> 01:34:13,986
MARISHA: Oh, come on.

1870
01:34:13,986 --> 01:34:15,805
TALIESIN: You keep going, I'll let you 
know, I'm going to read.

1871
01:34:15,805 --> 01:34:16,974
SAM: You have advantage.

1872
01:34:16,974 --> 01:34:19,482
MATT: So Trinket takes...

1873
01:34:19,482 --> 01:34:21,040
LIAM: A skillion hit points.

1874
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:25,877
MATT: So Trinket failed the save, Trinket 
would actually take 85 points of damage.

1875
01:34:25,877 --> 01:34:30,852
LAURA: Oh, he's unconscious and in my 
necklace. Good job, Trinket.

1876
01:34:30,852 --> 01:34:32,676
He was within 100 feet of me, right?

1877
01:34:32,676 --> 01:34:35,285
MATT: Yes, he was. He was over here.

1878
01:34:35,285 --> 01:34:37,068
LAURA: I'm glad I moved back.

1879
01:34:37,068 --> 01:34:40,263
(gasps) Would he have been further 
than 100 feet if I hadn't moved back?

1880
01:34:40,263 --> 01:34:41,726
MATT: No, he'd have to be pretty far to 
be further than 100 feet from you.

1881
01:34:41,726 --> 01:34:43,042
LAURA: Okay.

1882
01:34:43,042 --> 01:34:43,993
MATT: Grog?

1883
01:34:43,993 --> 01:34:45,247
TRAVIS: 11.

1884
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:47,435
MATT: 11. You take 118 points of damage.

1885
01:34:47,435 --> 01:34:52,403
TRAVIS: Now, is it-- do I halve the 
bludgeoning because of raging?

1886
01:34:52,403 --> 01:34:58,171
MATT: You know what? I believe you do, yes. 
So you actually suffer the same, eighty--

1887
01:34:58,171 --> 01:34:59,058
LAURA: 85, you said.

1888
01:34:59,058 --> 01:35:00,429
MATT: 85.

1889
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:03,852
LAURA: Okay, and Pike got a nine.

1890
01:35:03,852 --> 01:35:05,048
SAM: This is the big one.

1891
01:35:05,048 --> 01:35:06,918
MATT: Pike takes 118 points of damage.

1892
01:35:06,918 --> 01:35:08,512
LAURA: But she's fire resistant.

1893
01:35:08,512 --> 01:35:13,741
MATT: Right, so that's true. So she 
takes 87 points of damage.

1894
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:15,410
LAURA: All right.

1895
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,405
MARISHA: She still up?

1896
01:35:16,405 --> 01:35:17,865
LAURA: She's still up.

1897
01:35:17,865 --> 01:35:19,295
TALIESIN: I'll wait until you guys 
are done.

1898
01:35:19,295 --> 01:35:20,887
I'll wait until they're done and then 
I'll pop in with my reaction.

1899
01:35:20,887 --> 01:35:23,997
TRAVIS: That's the single most powerful 
attack we've ever had hit, right?

1900
01:35:23,997 --> 01:35:27,309
PATRICK: Actually, I'm really glad to hear 
that, because if I'm going to go out--

1901
01:35:27,309 --> 01:35:29,010
TRAVIS: You might as well go out with 
the ace, man.

1902
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:30,940
TALIESIN: Literally in a hail of bullets.

1903
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,488
TRAVIS: That had some stank on it.

1904
01:35:32,488 --> 01:35:35,320
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate-- I'm going 
to use my reaction to activate Cabal's Ruin.

1905
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:41,328
I'm going to absorb the spell and the 
damage I take is halved

1906
01:35:41,328 --> 01:35:44,751
and the cloak gains the number of 
charges equal to the spell's level,

1907
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:46,557
the level of the triggering shot.

1908
01:35:46,557 --> 01:35:47,971
MATT: Yes, it does.

1909
01:35:47,971 --> 01:35:49,450
LAURA: Wow, that is a clutch--

1910
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:50,789
LIAM: Yeah, Perce!

1911
01:35:50,789 --> 01:35:51,810
LAURA: That is major.

1912
01:35:51,810 --> 01:35:52,919
MATT: Which, it's a ninth-level spell.

1913
01:35:52,919 --> 01:35:58,812
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't get all nine, do I, 
because-- does the spell hold nine charges?

1914
01:35:58,812 --> 01:36:03,396
MATT: The cloak holds six charges. 
However, as you absorb the spell,

1915
01:36:03,396 --> 01:36:08,851
the cloak flares out and actually grows 
an additional six inches in length.

1916
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:15,836
The inside begins to sparkle with electric energy as 
it pulls one of the meteors into the cloak itself.

1917
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:18,847
It arcs inward and vanishes into the side.

1918
01:36:18,847 --> 01:36:20,905
It bursts behind you, and the damage 
is taken,

1919
01:36:20,905 --> 01:36:27,021
but the cloak now is shimmering with a very 
vibrant but continuous spark of arcane energy.

1920
01:36:27,021 --> 01:36:29,159
LAURA: My eyes are like--

1921
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:33,409
SAM: It awoke, it awoke!

1922
01:36:33,409 --> 01:36:36,189
MATT: Pass this over, please.

1923
01:36:36,189 --> 01:36:37,906
LAURA: You got upgraded!

1924
01:36:37,906 --> 01:36:41,003
(All sing.)

1925
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:43,610
TALIESIN: Oh shit. What! Okay, so.

1926
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:47,402
SAM: 'Exalted', it says. Not just awoken. 
Exalted.

1927
01:36:47,402 --> 01:36:48,611
MARISHA: It has ten charges in it.

1928
01:36:48,611 --> 01:36:52,446
LAURA: Oh my god. I'm so jealous! 
What do I do?

1929
01:36:52,446 --> 01:36:57,929
TALIESIN: So I'm at nine, the damage 
is still halved?

1930
01:36:57,929 --> 01:36:59,596
LAURA: What if I die without 
upgrading my bow?

1931
01:36:59,596 --> 01:37:03,796
MATT: The damage is still halved, yeah. 
So you took a total of 59 points of damage.

1932
01:37:03,796 --> 01:37:06,410
TALIESIN: 59 points of damage, okay. 
So I'm going to add 59 hitpoints to that.

1933
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:12,941
LIAM: De Rolo just went full peacock. 
He suddenly has a giant cowboy hat on.

1934
01:37:12,941 --> 01:37:18,764
SAM: It says anyone who wears the exalted 
Cabal's Ruin has permanently oiled skin.

1935
01:37:18,764 --> 01:37:21,157
(all laugh)

1936
01:37:21,157 --> 01:37:23,014
MATT: It's a full paragraph descriptor of 
it on the actual item.

1937
01:37:23,014 --> 01:37:27,163
TALIESIN: I'm back at 81 points, so that's 
nice. And I have nine charges in the cloak.

1938
01:37:27,163 --> 01:37:29,289
MATT: Yes you do.

1939
01:37:29,289 --> 01:37:30,920
TALIESIN: Okay, that's awesome.

1940
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,553
SAM: You should've used that shit.

1941
01:37:32,553 --> 01:37:34,089
TALIESIN: It's never come up.

1942
01:37:34,089 --> 01:37:37,991
MATT: All right. Now, Raishan, trying-- 
so by the way,

1943
01:37:37,991 --> 01:37:40,814
I don't think it's possible for you to 
have spells up

1944
01:37:40,814 --> 01:37:43,147
to even make the concentration
saving throw on this,

1945
01:37:43,147 --> 01:37:45,007
because of the sheer amount of 
damage you took.

1946
01:37:45,007 --> 01:37:51,248
Make a concentration saving throw, 
Percy? Yeah, Kima lost hers.

1947
01:37:51,248 --> 01:37:52,920
SAM: Did Pike lose hers?

1948
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,335
MATT: Pike-- roll a constitution saving 
throw for Pike.

1949
01:37:55,335 --> 01:37:57,041
MARISHA: You have to do over the 
damage you did.

1950
01:37:57,041 --> 01:37:59,176
TALIESIN: That's 16 is my concentration 
save.

1951
01:37:59,176 --> 01:38:00,708
MATT: Yeah, so your--

1952
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,476
TALIESIN: My Hex--

1953
01:38:03,476 --> 01:38:05,061
MATT: Your Hex is gone.

1954
01:38:05,061 --> 01:38:07,282
LIAM: Am I good with my Hunter's Mark?

1955
01:38:07,282 --> 01:38:08,705
MATT: You didn't take any damage, 
so you're fine.

1956
01:38:08,705 --> 01:38:09,679
TALIESIN: I was busy.

1957
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:11,733
LAURA: You're fine, you're fucking fine. I 
can't believe you haven't taken any damage.

1958
01:38:11,733 --> 01:38:13,155
MATT: You haven't tagged her with it yet, 
but you've still got it up.

1959
01:38:13,155 --> 01:38:15,114
LAURA: I mean, you'd better save all of us 
when we all die when you're flying around like--

1960
01:38:15,114 --> 01:38:16,774
LIAM: Our relationship is very complicated.

1961
01:38:16,774 --> 01:38:18,543
LAURA: I guess just like walking around.

1962
01:38:18,543 --> 01:38:20,008
MATT: What was Pike's saving throw?

1963
01:38:20,008 --> 01:38:21,653
LAURA: No, she didn't make it, 
she got five.

1964
01:38:21,653 --> 01:38:25,363
MATT: All right, so yeah, her spell is 
gone as well.

1965
01:38:25,363 --> 01:38:26,583
LAURA: Great.

1966
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:28,670
MATT: And Vex, I need you to make 
your concentration saving throw.

1967
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:29,902
TALIESIN: Oh shit, okay.

1968
01:38:29,902 --> 01:38:31,331
MATT: Constitution.

1969
01:38:31,331 --> 01:38:32,426
LAURA: Nope.

1970
01:38:32,426 --> 01:38:37,392
MATT: Lose your Hunter's Mark as well. 
All righty.

1971
01:38:37,392 --> 01:38:38,935
TRAVIS: Yeah, get rid of that one now.

1972
01:38:38,935 --> 01:38:40,571
MATT: And Raishan's going to make a 
strength saving throw--

1973
01:38:40,571 --> 01:38:43,672
SAM: Ooh. Ooh.

1974
01:38:43,672 --> 01:38:47,119
MATT: That is a 19, so she is no 
longer restrained.

1975
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,317
MARISHA: Fucking fuck.

1976
01:38:49,317 --> 01:38:53,813
SAM: Did the dog get hit?

1977
01:38:53,813 --> 01:38:57,149
MATT: Oh, the dog got hit.

1978
01:38:57,149 --> 01:38:58,936
TRAVIS: No! Not McGruff!

1979
01:38:58,936 --> 01:39:00,862
MATT: As the impact hits you and 
you're like--

1980
01:39:00,862 --> 01:39:02,705
SAM: Can I roll for the dog?

1981
01:39:02,705 --> 01:39:04,460
MATT: It won't even matter.

1982
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:05,611
SAM: Okay.

1983
01:39:05,611 --> 01:39:07,041
TRAVIS: He is smoked.

1984
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:11,829
MATT: The dog takes enough damage to immediately 
revert back to the onyx figure that it was,

1985
01:39:11,829 --> 01:39:19,466
but the impact sends it careening through 
the room like a pinball.

1986
01:39:19,466 --> 01:39:22,658
SAM: Every time we use this dog that's 
what happens.

1987
01:39:22,658 --> 01:39:24,058
PATRICK: Imagine his life.

1988
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:25,434
(all laugh)

1989
01:39:25,434 --> 01:39:28,305
PATRICK: Just moments of like-- 
(explosions)

1990
01:39:28,305 --> 01:39:31,350
TRAVIS: How's it going? 
(barking, explosion)

1991
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:33,962
SAM: I think we've only brought him out 
twice and he's been blown up both times.

1992
01:39:33,962 --> 01:39:37,663
LAURA: He's been exploded, yeah. It's 
so sad.

1993
01:39:37,663 --> 01:39:41,224
PATRICK: It's worse if you imagine how a 
dog always greets you when you come home.

1994
01:39:41,224 --> 01:39:42,554
LAURA: He's just so happy.

1995
01:39:42,554 --> 01:39:44,420
PATRICK: Imagine-- that's how he comes 
out, it's like, hey! Hey!

1996
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,670
MARISHA: I'm so happy to see you!

1997
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:47,350
MATT: (explosion)

1998
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,952
LAURA: No, he's a bit of a snooty dog, 
actually.

1999
01:39:48,952 --> 01:39:49,841
PATRICK: Oh, okay.

2000
01:39:49,841 --> 01:39:50,838
TALIESIN: Kind of a snooty dog.

2001
01:39:50,838 --> 01:39:53,499
LIAM: We need a scene with the dog and 
Trinket commiserating over a bowl of--

2002
01:39:53,499 --> 01:39:55,095
TRAVIS: Earl Grey.

2003
01:39:55,095 --> 01:39:56,923
LIAM: Constantly getting blasted up.

2004
01:39:56,923 --> 01:39:58,811
MARISHA: Kibbles and bits for you too?

2005
01:39:58,811 --> 01:40:01,685
MATT: All righty. So, ending Raishan's 
turn. Scanlan, you're up.

2006
01:40:01,685 --> 01:40:03,491
SAM: Oh man, that smarted.

2007
01:40:03,491 --> 01:40:04,968
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2008
01:40:04,968 --> 01:40:08,605
SAM: Um. Okay, is Kerrek around me?

2009
01:40:08,605 --> 01:40:12,386
MATT: Kerrek is way back here, so 
he's about 100 feet from you.

2010
01:40:12,386 --> 01:40:14,868
SAM: 100 feet.

2011
01:40:14,868 --> 01:40:16,155
MATT: Yes, roughly.

2012
01:40:16,155 --> 01:40:18,701
PATRICK: There's a paladin over there 
that'll probably-- hopefully--

2013
01:40:18,701 --> 01:40:21,673
SAM: Well, I can't reach you anyway, so.

2014
01:40:21,673 --> 01:40:23,702
MATT: Allura's down, and everyone around 
you is pretty--

2015
01:40:23,702 --> 01:40:25,337
SAM: Oh, can I see Allura from where I am?

2016
01:40:25,337 --> 01:40:28,513
MATT: Allura is right over here, so yeah, 
you can see Allura.

2017
01:40:28,513 --> 01:40:32,343
MARISHA: So the only people who've gone 
down are Allura and Kerrek?

2018
01:40:32,343 --> 01:40:35,086
MATT: Kerrek. Everyone else seems to 
still be standing.

2019
01:40:35,086 --> 01:40:36,075
MARISHA: Okay.

2020
01:40:36,075 --> 01:40:37,600
LAURA: Barely, but standing.

2021
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,495
TALIESIN: The wraiths didn't take any 
damage, did they?

2022
01:40:40,495 --> 01:40:45,389
MATT: The one wraith that was there... 
yes, actually, that wraith was destroyed.

2023
01:40:45,389 --> 01:40:46,819
Thank you for the reminder.

2024
01:40:46,819 --> 01:40:48,075
TALIESIN: Silver lining.

2025
01:40:48,075 --> 01:40:49,410
MARISHA: Silver lining.

2026
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,071
TRAVIS: Second one is still there, right?

2027
01:40:51,071 --> 01:40:52,049
LAURA: The other one was--

2028
01:40:52,049 --> 01:40:54,961
MATT: The other one just got destroyed 
by the Meteor Swarm.

2029
01:40:54,961 --> 01:40:57,702
LAURA: And Thordak is just even more 
watermelon.

2030
01:40:57,702 --> 01:41:04,229
MATT: Yeah. It is just-- the room already had 
old carnage on it, now it has new carnage.

2031
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:05,461
TALIESIN: Fresh paint.

2032
01:41:05,461 --> 01:41:10,049
MATT: It looks kind of like the Butcher in Diablo I, 
when you get to his room and it's just covered.

2033
01:41:10,049 --> 01:41:11,900
LIAM: It's everything he deserves.

2034
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,413
MATT: All right. So, Scanlan, what are 
you doing?

2035
01:41:13,413 --> 01:41:15,631
SAM: I'm going to heal Allura.

2036
01:41:15,631 --> 01:41:18,937
MATT: Okay, you'll have to get a little closer 
if you're doing-- is it 30 or 60 feet for your--

2037
01:41:18,937 --> 01:41:20,457
SAM: It's 30.

2038
01:41:20,457 --> 01:41:23,276
MATT: 30? So you'll have to be a 
little closer.

2039
01:41:23,276 --> 01:41:25,062
SAM: Well then, I'll walk that way as 
much as I can, actually.

2040
01:41:25,062 --> 01:41:26,395
MATT: Okay.

2041
01:41:26,395 --> 01:41:27,576
SAM: Yeah, right there.

2042
01:41:27,576 --> 01:41:31,091
MATT: As you pull back--

2043
01:41:31,091 --> 01:41:33,022
MARISHA: What? No!

2044
01:41:33,022 --> 01:41:34,135
TALIESIN: No.

2045
01:41:34,135 --> 01:41:35,108
SAM: Sure.

2046
01:41:35,108 --> 01:41:37,117
TRAVIS: High five? High five me, bro?

2047
01:41:37,117 --> 01:41:41,196
MATT: Yeah, high five you with the claw. 
Raishan takes an attack of opportunity on you,

2048
01:41:41,196 --> 01:41:47,419
her invisible form right at the edge of 
that fog cloud. Oh, that is a 15.

2049
01:41:47,419 --> 01:41:51,494
SAM: Yeah, that hits. Unless I Cutting 
Words it.

2050
01:41:51,494 --> 01:41:52,725
MATT: That's up to you.

2051
01:41:52,725 --> 01:41:54,725
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah! Do the thing, 
do the thing.

2052
01:41:54,725 --> 01:42:00,632
SAM: Shit. I'll Cutting Words it. Sorry, Allura. 
Oh wait, no, that's not a bonus action--

2053
01:42:00,632 --> 01:42:01,764
MATT: That's your reaction.

2054
01:42:01,764 --> 01:42:04,050
SAM: --that's a reaction. So yes, I will 
Cutting Words.

2055
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:09,897
I will yell at the claw I see coming out 
of the cloud of smoke, I will say,

2056
01:42:09,897 --> 01:42:15,144
"You're so dumb, you get your yearly 
checkup from Dr. Dranzel."

2057
01:42:15,144 --> 01:42:18,144
(Weak laughter.)

2058
01:42:18,144 --> 01:42:21,583
MATT: Roll a d12.

2059
01:42:21,583 --> 01:42:25,335
TRAVIS: That was like some six-week-old 
orange juice.

2060
01:42:25,335 --> 01:42:26,522
SAM: Two.

2061
01:42:26,522 --> 01:42:27,766
MATT: That reduces it to 13.

2062
01:42:27,766 --> 01:42:30,869
SAM: That does not hit.

2063
01:42:30,869 --> 01:42:33,356
MATT: So you hear this voice go, 
"Wait, who?"

2064
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:35,141
(all laugh)

2065
01:42:35,141 --> 01:42:38,632
MATT: From the fog, and this wisp of wind 
just misses you

2066
01:42:38,632 --> 01:42:42,902
A claw just catches the back of a hair.

2067
01:42:42,902 --> 01:42:45,437
But yeah, you move fine and you are 
within range now.

2068
01:42:45,437 --> 01:42:50,455
SAM: Jesus Christ. Okay, so I will 
do a Healing Word on Allura.

2069
01:42:50,455 --> 01:42:52,180
MATT: Okay.

2070
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:54,250
SAM: I will sing to her,

2071
01:42:54,250 --> 01:43:02,096
(singing) "Scanlan singing in the dead of 
night, take your broken bones and learn to fly"

2072
01:43:02,096 --> 01:43:03,742
That's all I got.

2073
01:43:03,742 --> 01:43:06,033
MARISHA: I love that song.

2074
01:43:06,033 --> 01:43:08,632
MATT: (singing) "You were only waiting to 
get up and cast a spell."

2075
01:43:08,632 --> 01:43:10,499
SAM: Yes! Do I roll?

2076
01:43:10,499 --> 01:43:11,650
MATT: Yes, you roll for that.

2077
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,184
SAM: Yes. d4, right?

2078
01:43:13,184 --> 01:43:14,707
MATT: d4 plus six.

2079
01:43:14,707 --> 01:43:16,573
SAM: Four! That's ten!

2080
01:43:16,573 --> 01:43:18,326
MATT: All right. She is at ten hit points. 
Conscious.

2081
01:43:18,338 --> 01:43:19,438
SAM: Double-dig.

2082
01:43:19,438 --> 01:43:22,297
MATT: Allura now (gasps). "Oh dear."

2083
01:43:22,297 --> 01:43:24,784
LAURA: I look down at her like--

2084
01:43:24,847 --> 01:43:26,797
MATT: (nervous laugh)

2085
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:39,733
SAM: I will also boopadeeboopboop (raspberry 
sounds). Yeah. So I still have an action, right?

2086
01:43:39,733 --> 01:43:44,033
MATT: You do.

2087
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:51,435
SAM: And when I saw the form rise up in the 
cloud, it did not move away, it just rose up.

2088
01:43:51,503 --> 01:43:54,212
MATT: Correct, yeah. It was right at the 
cusp of the fog.

2089
01:43:54,212 --> 01:43:57,843
SAM: So I have a vicinity. I saw a claw, 
I saw something like--

2090
01:43:57,843 --> 01:43:59,083
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

2091
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:00,459
SAM: I can take a shot.

2092
01:44:00,459 --> 01:44:01,714
MATT: If you want to.

2093
01:44:01,714 --> 01:44:03,181
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to take a shot.

2094
01:44:03,181 --> 01:44:04,979
MATT: What're you doing?

2095
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:13,124
SAM: I am going to cast-- let's do 
Bigby's Hand at level six.

2096
01:44:13,124 --> 01:44:14,576
MATT: Okay!

2097
01:44:14,576 --> 01:44:16,331
SAM: Yeah.

2098
01:44:16,331 --> 01:44:17,592
TRAVIS: Yeah, dude. Yeah!

2099
01:44:17,592 --> 01:44:18,769
SAM: Sure.

2100
01:44:18,769 --> 01:44:19,690
TRAVIS: Commitment.

2101
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:22,109
MATT: Right at the outside of the radius? 
Where the dragon is?

2102
01:44:22,109 --> 01:44:24,511
SAM: I mean, it's probably got to punch 
into the cloud a little bit to get--

2103
01:44:24,511 --> 01:44:28,048
MATT: Yeah, but it's right, it's right at the 
cusp of where you saw the dragon's form moving.

2104
01:44:28,048 --> 01:44:29,051
SAM: Yeah.

2105
01:44:29,051 --> 01:44:36,342
MATT: Okay. And so at level six? So for 
that-- and you're using the punching?

2106
01:44:36,342 --> 01:44:38,060
SAM: Yes, please.

2107
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:43,665
MATT: All righty. So go ahead and roll a 
d20, adding your spell attack modifier.

2108
01:44:43,665 --> 01:44:49,615
SAM: That was a cocked roll, but I'll take it, 
because I'm a man of honor, and it did not work. 13.

2109
01:44:49,615 --> 01:44:52,057
MATT: 13, no, that misses.

2110
01:44:52,057 --> 01:44:53,392
TRAVIS: Was it cocked?

2111
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:55,542
LAURA: But if it was cocked, then it 
doesn't count.

2112
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:59,959
SAM: Didn't actually roll. It hit the 
side of my box.

2113
01:44:59,959 --> 01:45:02,291
MATT: It's still a roll, it's fine.

2114
01:45:02,291 --> 01:45:06,128
So the fist-- whoosh-- into the fog, just 
manages to move past the form,

2115
01:45:06,128 --> 01:45:08,117
does not actually hit the side of it.

2116
01:45:08,117 --> 01:45:09,852
SAM: Balls. All right.

2117
01:45:09,852 --> 01:45:12,702
MATT: Does not hit balls either. But 
Bigby's fist is up and around.

2118
01:45:12,702 --> 01:45:14,247
SAM: Okay, good.

2119
01:45:14,247 --> 01:45:15,975
MATT: All right, that ends your turn.

2120
01:45:15,975 --> 01:45:19,138
PATRICK: Oh, what about the radiant weapon, 
did that-- was that a concentration spell?

2121
01:45:19,138 --> 01:45:20,195
LAURA: It was.

2122
01:45:20,195 --> 01:45:21,208
PATRICK: Oh.

2123
01:45:21,208 --> 01:45:23,117
LAURA: Oh wait, no, it's not a 
concentration. No.

2124
01:45:23,117 --> 01:45:24,409
MATT: Yeah, that's still around.

2125
01:45:24,409 --> 01:45:25,371
LAURA: Spiritual Weapon's still up?

2126
01:45:25,371 --> 01:45:27,524
MATT: When it comes to Pike's turn, 
Pike can still do that.

2127
01:45:27,524 --> 01:45:28,259
PATRICK: Okay.

2128
01:45:28,259 --> 01:45:29,182
LAURA: Yeah.

2129
01:45:29,182 --> 01:45:30,594
MATT: Good looking out.

2130
01:45:30,594 --> 01:45:32,540
TRAVIS: (singing) Stay alive...

2131
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:38,204
MATT: That's going to be the end of your turn. 
Raishan is going to use two legendary actions to--

2132
01:45:38,204 --> 01:45:39,737
TALIESIN: Burn 'em, baby.

2133
01:45:39,737 --> 01:45:41,182
MARISHA: How many does she have?

2134
01:45:41,182 --> 01:45:42,283
TALIESIN: Too many.

2135
01:45:42,283 --> 01:45:43,855
MATT: Four per turn.

2136
01:45:43,855 --> 01:45:45,699
MARISHA: Four per turn? Jeez.

2137
01:45:45,699 --> 01:45:50,207
MATT: Is going to go ahead and cast 
Disintegrate at Pike.

2138
01:45:50,207 --> 01:45:53,523
LAURA: What? Disintegrate? What'd he say?

2139
01:45:53,523 --> 01:45:54,906
LIAM: Disintegrate toward Pike.

2140
01:45:54,906 --> 01:45:57,090
LAURA: No!

2141
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:58,081
TALIESIN: No.

2142
01:45:58,081 --> 01:46:00,156
LAURA: No.

2143
01:46:00,156 --> 01:46:05,479
SAM: Is that bad?

2144
01:46:05,479 --> 01:46:08,782
LAURA: Please tell me that's a natural one that 
you just rolled and you're taking a picture of it.

2145
01:46:08,782 --> 01:46:11,581
MARISHA: I know, right? Yeah.

2146
01:46:11,581 --> 01:46:13,138
MATT: I'm taking a picture of it right 
now.

2147
01:46:13,138 --> 01:46:15,065
TRAVIS: Throw the laser pointer over here.

2148
01:46:15,065 --> 01:46:17,277
TALIESIN: He somehow rolled a 46 and they're 
trying to figure out what to do about it.

2149
01:46:17,277 --> 01:46:18,662
TRAVIS: Laser pointer!

2150
01:46:18,662 --> 01:46:21,433
TALIESIN: Laser pointer?

2151
01:46:21,433 --> 01:46:22,499
LIAM: Pass it.

2152
01:46:22,499 --> 01:46:23,902
TALIESIN: Okay, fine.

2153
01:46:23,902 --> 01:46:25,666
MATT: I'm checking to make sure this is 
how the spell works.

2154
01:46:25,666 --> 01:46:27,421
TRAVIS: Blind him. Blind him!

2155
01:46:27,421 --> 01:46:30,324
MATT: This is going to be really funny. 
Don't blind me, I'm trying to help.

2156
01:46:30,324 --> 01:46:32,536
TRAVIS: Take the shot!

2157
01:46:32,536 --> 01:46:33,916
TALIESIN: I have the shot.

2158
01:46:33,916 --> 01:46:36,000
MATT: Oh, has to make a dexterity saving 
throw, so that roll wouldn't matter.

2159
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,229
I rolled a one, but it doesn't matter 
because it's not an attack.

2160
01:46:38,229 --> 01:46:40,663
Dexterity saving throw on Pike, please.

2161
01:46:40,663 --> 01:46:41,683
LIAM: Fuck.

2162
01:46:41,683 --> 01:46:43,712
LAURA: I don't want to roll it, it's too 
much pressure.

2163
01:46:43,712 --> 01:46:45,933
MARISHA: Can we just pretend that one 
was like a nat 20 for Pike?

2164
01:46:45,933 --> 01:46:50,128
LIAM: I'll roll it, one of us has to roll it. 
Here's what it is, this is what it is. It's a 14.

2165
01:46:50,128 --> 01:46:51,608
LAURA: 14?

2166
01:46:51,608 --> 01:46:54,960
MATT: Total 14? That's not enough.

2167
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:59,512
PATRICK: Is she by anyone with the paladin 
radius? We got a bunch of pallies here.

2168
01:46:59,512 --> 01:47:01,708
LAURA: She's not by any of the paladins.

2169
01:47:01,708 --> 01:47:04,033
MATT: Uh, you know what? Actually, Allura 
is conscious on the ground.

2170
01:47:04,033 --> 01:47:10,858
Allura is going to attempt to counterspell 
that. That is a sixth-level spell.

2171
01:47:10,858 --> 01:47:17,724
'Cause Allura's going to try and get that 
out at the last minute. So.

2172
01:47:17,724 --> 01:47:21,549
LAURA: With Disintegrate, does the body 
go away? I don't understand.

2173
01:47:21,549 --> 01:47:22,520
LIAM: Yeah.

2174
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,248
TRAVIS: Yeah, it ain't good.

2175
01:47:24,248 --> 01:47:26,195
TALIESIN: Will the armor retort that 
or no?

2176
01:47:26,195 --> 01:47:27,691
SAM: Yeah, the armor brings her back 
to one point, doesn't it?

2177
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:29,688
MATT: Okay, fourth or higher... DC equals 
10 plus the spell level.

2178
01:47:29,688 --> 01:47:34,405
Allura's spell modifier is five, so-- 
That is an eight. That's not enough.

2179
01:47:34,405 --> 01:47:38,927
She rolled an eight plus five, that's not 
enough to counter the spell.

2180
01:47:38,927 --> 01:47:52,560
Okay, so that goes to... Pike suffers, so
that's 72 points of force damage.

2181
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:57,596
LAURA: Well, she's knocked unconscious, 
but the armor should bring her back.

2182
01:47:57,596 --> 01:48:04,594
MATT: Pike, as the beam hits her, you 
watch her flesh begin to turn to dust

2183
01:48:04,594 --> 01:48:13,147
as the fingers begin to disperse... as a 
burst of flame from the armor flares outward,

2184
01:48:13,147 --> 01:48:17,738
bringing her back to her feet at whatever 
the effect of the armor is, so she gets up.

2185
01:48:17,738 --> 01:48:19,701
SAM: Is it five?

2186
01:48:19,701 --> 01:48:22,972
LIAM: She gets like one hit point, I 
think.

2187
01:48:22,972 --> 01:48:23,747
TRAVIS: What's the effect of the armor?

2188
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:24,486
LAURA: The effect of the armor--

2189
01:48:24,486 --> 01:48:25,679
LIAM: She's up, she's up. She's not dead.

2190
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:26,819
LAURA: Brings her back to five hit points.

2191
01:48:26,819 --> 01:48:28,074
MATT: I had forgotten she had that.

2192
01:48:28,074 --> 01:48:29,617
LAURA: And she's on her feet.

2193
01:48:29,617 --> 01:48:30,899
MATT: So she's on her feet.

2194
01:48:30,899 --> 01:48:33,424
LAURA: Is-- no, Raishan's not within 
15 feet of her, is she?

2195
01:48:33,424 --> 01:48:35,645
MATT: No.

2196
01:48:35,645 --> 01:48:36,690
LAURA: Okay.

2197
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:38,312
LIAM: Okay, she's not dust.

2198
01:48:38,312 --> 01:48:42,566
MATT: She's not dust. Okay. 
That brings us to--

2199
01:48:42,566 --> 01:48:45,676
SAM: (laughs) Oh, Jesus.

2200
01:48:45,676 --> 01:48:48,626
LAURA: I can't, if Ashley's not here, you 
can't kill her when she's not here.

2201
01:48:48,626 --> 01:48:50,226
MATT: Grog, you're up.

2202
01:48:50,226 --> 01:48:51,913
SAM: She's not dead, she's walking around.

2203
01:48:51,913 --> 01:48:53,353
MATT: She's not-- I'm acting like she 
would!

2204
01:48:53,353 --> 01:48:54,821
MARISHA: That would be the worst 
fucking phone call, Matt.

2205
01:48:54,821 --> 01:48:56,109
MATT: I know!

2206
01:48:56,109 --> 01:48:57,868
LAURA: If Ashley dies when she's 
not here--

2207
01:48:57,868 --> 01:49:01,069
MATT: She's also the cleric, that's exactly 
what Raishan would do! Grog, you're up.

2208
01:49:01,069 --> 01:49:02,942
TRAVIS: I take out the cask of ale and I 
start drinking.

2209
01:49:02,942 --> 01:49:05,681
(all laugh)

2210
01:49:05,681 --> 01:49:08,509
TRAVIS: No. Now that I don't have any more
wraiths,

2211
01:49:08,509 --> 01:49:11,997
I'm going to run towards this wall if 
I can. This one.

2212
01:49:11,997 --> 01:49:13,210
MATT: This one over here?

2213
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:14,403
TRAVIS: Yeah, right there.

2214
01:49:14,403 --> 01:49:17,491
MATT: Okay.

2215
01:49:17,491 --> 01:49:20,386
TRAVIS: 50 feet, and I'll leap the rest, 
just to get up to the--

2216
01:49:20,386 --> 01:49:21,605
MATT: That's as far as you can get, there.

2217
01:49:21,605 --> 01:49:24,194
TRAVIS: Yeah. And that is--

2218
01:49:24,194 --> 01:49:27,958
MATT: So go ahead and roll your athletics 
check to leap.

2219
01:49:27,958 --> 01:49:29,803
TRAVIS: 22.

2220
01:49:29,803 --> 01:49:34,614
MATT: Yeah, that's fine. So you can leap 
20 feet.

2221
01:49:34,614 --> 01:49:42,266
Yeah, Mr. Badger, you're gone, you are 
scattered. All righty.

2222
01:49:42,266 --> 01:49:44,182
TRAVIS: Oh, I can throw!

2223
01:49:44,182 --> 01:49:45,636
MATT: Well, you have to roll a perception 
check

2224
01:49:45,636 --> 01:49:47,427
to see if you can see the invisible form 
in there.

2225
01:49:47,427 --> 01:49:49,038
TRAVIS: Oh, this'll go well.

2226
01:49:49,038 --> 01:49:50,029
LAURA: Natural 20.

2227
01:49:50,029 --> 01:49:50,770
TRAVIS: Nope.

2228
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:51,765
LAURA: Damn.

2229
01:49:51,765 --> 01:49:54,854
SAM: Oh, when Bigby's Hand went at rest, 
it just started to just-- yeah.

2230
01:49:54,854 --> 01:49:55,898
MATT: Just pointing.

2231
01:49:55,898 --> 01:49:57,384
(all laugh)

2232
01:49:57,384 --> 01:50:01,526
MATT: Here! Perfect.

2233
01:50:01,526 --> 01:50:03,929
TRAVIS: That is a 16.

2234
01:50:03,929 --> 01:50:07,887
MATT: Okay. I'll say between that roll and 
the Bigby's Hand pointing at where the dragon is,

2235
01:50:07,887 --> 01:50:10,612
I'll let you make your attacks, but they're 
at disadvantage.

2236
01:50:10,612 --> 01:50:15,363
TRAVIS: Awesome. Well, I'll make 'em 
Reckless, so I'll zero them out.

2237
01:50:15,363 --> 01:50:17,265
Can I throw the dwarven thrower?

2238
01:50:17,265 --> 01:50:18,645
MATT: Yes you can.

2239
01:50:18,645 --> 01:50:23,354
TRAVIS: Okay. One roll. 21.

2240
01:50:23,354 --> 01:50:31,165
MATT: Nope. The hammer just disappears 
into the fog and returns back to your grasp.

2241
01:50:31,165 --> 01:50:33,243
TRAVIS: That's better. 31.

2242
01:50:33,243 --> 01:50:40,675
MATT: That does hit.

2243
01:50:40,675 --> 01:50:42,527
TRAVIS: 18 points of damage.

2244
01:50:42,527 --> 01:50:44,105
MATT: 18 points of damage?

2245
01:50:44,105 --> 01:50:45,258
TRAVIS: Oh, thrown.

2246
01:50:45,258 --> 01:50:46,376
MATT: Yeah, plus the--

2247
01:50:46,376 --> 01:50:47,794
TRAVIS: 20.

2248
01:50:47,794 --> 01:50:52,844
MATT: 20. Okay. Constitution saving 
throw, yeah, makes the concentration one.

2249
01:50:52,844 --> 01:50:55,452
Are you Frenzied or not?

2250
01:50:55,452 --> 01:50:57,569
TRAVIS: I would like to go into a 
Frenzied Rage.

2251
01:50:57,569 --> 01:50:59,593
MATT: Yeah, Frenzied Rage, so make 
your bonus attack strike now.

2252
01:50:59,593 --> 01:51:01,526
SAM: Was that a saving throw?

2253
01:51:01,526 --> 01:51:04,538
MATT: Yeah, it has to maintain concentration
on Greater Invisibility every time it takes damage.

2254
01:51:04,538 --> 01:51:07,121
SAM: Technically, disadvantage because 
of Cutting Words.

2255
01:51:07,121 --> 01:51:12,913
MATT: That's true. And that would be a 
19. Still makes it, yeah.

2256
01:51:12,913 --> 01:51:13,758
SAM: Damn.

2257
01:51:13,758 --> 01:51:15,500
MATT: It needs to make more damage.

2258
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:16,856
TRAVIS: 28.

2259
01:51:16,856 --> 01:51:18,464
MATT: 28 damage.

2260
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:19,808
TRAVIS: No, no, 28 to hit on the 
third throw.

2261
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:26,908
MATT: Oh, that does hit, yeah.

2262
01:51:26,908 --> 01:51:28,656
TRAVIS: 22 points of damage.

2263
01:51:28,656 --> 01:51:34,475
MATT: 22. Saving throw. Yeah, it 
succeeds, so it maintains invisibility.

2264
01:51:34,475 --> 01:51:36,965
All right. Ending your turn, Grog?

2265
01:51:36,965 --> 01:51:38,610
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does.

2266
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,675
PATRICK: Does the Cutting Word-- 
how long does that last?

2267
01:51:40,675 --> 01:51:42,310
SAM: Just the next saving throw.

2268
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,399
PATRICK: The next saving throw.

2269
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:44,176
SAM: That's it.

2270
01:51:44,176 --> 01:51:45,411
PATRICK: That's cool.

2271
01:51:45,411 --> 01:51:46,351
MATT: All right.

2272
01:51:46,351 --> 01:51:47,331
TALIESIN: Words are mean, man.

2273
01:51:47,331 --> 01:51:48,159
PATRICK: Words hurt.

2274
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:49,214
SAM: Well, that's not from words, that's 
from the sword.

2275
01:51:49,214 --> 01:51:50,019
TALIESIN: That's the sword?

2276
01:51:50,019 --> 01:51:50,855
SAM: From my Mythcarver.

2277
01:51:50,855 --> 01:51:52,243
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

2278
01:51:52,243 --> 01:51:57,999
MATT: At the end of your turn, Grog, she's 
going to use her other two legendary actions here

2279
01:51:57,999 --> 01:52:01,515
to go ahead and cast Cone of Cold.

2280
01:52:01,515 --> 01:52:04,190
TRAVIS: Not that shit again, I didn't do 
well on that last time.

2281
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:15,234
SAM: Cone of Cold? Again. I die.

2282
01:52:15,234 --> 01:52:17,638
MATT: So that's everybody there.

2283
01:52:17,638 --> 01:52:30,723
I need Scanlan, Vex, Pike, Vax, Grog, and Keyleth, 
and Allura, to all make constitution saving throws.

2284
01:52:30,723 --> 01:52:38,379
Constitution, yes.

2285
01:52:38,379 --> 01:52:45,220
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter)

2286
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:47,222
PATRICK: Not with your plus nine?

2287
01:52:47,222 --> 01:52:48,526
TRAVIS: No no no.

2288
01:52:48,526 --> 01:52:49,479
MATT: Keyleth?

2289
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:50,558
MARISHA: 13.

2290
01:52:50,558 --> 01:52:54,593
MATT: 13. You take 42 points of 
cold damage.

2291
01:52:54,593 --> 01:52:55,680
TRAVIS: How much?

2292
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:56,593
MATT: 42.

2293
01:52:56,593 --> 01:52:57,808
TRAVIS: Cool.

2294
01:52:57,808 --> 01:52:59,134
MARISHA: Is that the full damage, 
or did I--

2295
01:52:59,134 --> 01:53:00,646
MATT: That's the full damage.

2296
01:53:00,646 --> 01:53:01,724
TALIESIN: You're up.

2297
01:53:01,724 --> 01:53:02,188
MARISHA: I'm walking.

2298
01:53:02,188 --> 01:53:02,961
MATT: Vax.

2299
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:03,598
LIAM: 16.

2300
01:53:03,598 --> 01:53:05,192
MATT: 16, you take 42 points of 
cold damage. Vex?

2301
01:53:05,192 --> 01:53:06,498
LAURA: 12.

2302
01:53:06,498 --> 01:53:08,465
MATT: 12, you take 42 points of 
cold damage.

2303
01:53:08,465 --> 01:53:09,475
TRAVIS: Seven.

2304
01:53:09,475 --> 01:53:10,353
PATRICK: Don't you have Evasion?

2305
01:53:10,353 --> 01:53:11,161
LIAM: It's a constitution saving throw.

2306
01:53:11,161 --> 01:53:12,861
SAM: Am I in there?

2307
01:53:12,861 --> 01:53:14,919
MATT: You are as well. What'd you roll?

2308
01:53:14,919 --> 01:53:15,643
SAM: 15.

2309
01:53:15,643 --> 01:53:19,492
MATT: 42 points of cold damage.

2310
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:21,357
LAURA: 20 for Pike.

2311
01:53:21,357 --> 01:53:23,483
MATT: Pike takes 42 points of cold damage.

2312
01:53:23,483 --> 01:53:25,840
SAM: Shit.

2313
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,619
MATT: So Pike is unconscious. Who 
else is unconscious?

2314
01:53:27,619 --> 01:53:28,981
SAM: I am unconscious.

2315
01:53:28,981 --> 01:53:29,881
MARISHA: Fuck.

2316
01:53:29,881 --> 01:53:31,077
MATT: You are unconscious. Bigby's 
Hand is gone.

2317
01:53:31,077 --> 01:53:32,621
TRAVIS: Grab that popcorn, this 
movie's interesting.

2318
01:53:32,621 --> 01:53:34,922
TALIESIN: Nothing I have is useful.

2319
01:53:34,922 --> 01:53:36,787
SAM: (belches) Oh, I forgot we're on TV.

2320
01:53:36,787 --> 01:53:38,149
(all laugh)

2321
01:53:38,149 --> 01:53:39,092
LAURA: What did you do? Did you 
just burp really gross?

2322
01:53:39,092 --> 01:53:40,439
SAM: Burped, yeah.

2323
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:41,741
MATT: Allura is unconscious again.

2324
01:53:41,741 --> 01:53:43,176
MARISHA: This isn't TV, this is 
the internet.

2325
01:53:43,176 --> 01:53:45,717
TRAVIS: At least people can't smell it.

2326
01:53:45,717 --> 01:53:47,160
MARISHA: The wild west.

2327
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:50,213
MATT: So Allura's unconscious, Vex, 
you still up?

2328
01:53:50,213 --> 01:53:51,396
LAURA: I'm still up.

2329
01:53:51,396 --> 01:53:52,607
MARISHA: Allura's down again?

2330
01:53:52,607 --> 01:53:53,459
LAURA: Yep.

2331
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:54,342
MATT: Allura's down again, yeah, 
she got hit.

2332
01:53:54,342 --> 01:53:55,242
LAURA: Pike's down.

2333
01:53:55,242 --> 01:53:56,580
MATT: Pike's down.

2334
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:57,638
MARISHA: Fucking--

2335
01:53:57,638 --> 01:54:00,613
MATT: All right. That is all of her 
legendary actions this turn.

2336
01:54:00,613 --> 01:54:05,484
Ending Grog's turn, all righty. That 
brings us to Kerrek.

2337
01:54:05,484 --> 01:54:08,879
I need you to go ahead and roll a 
death saving throw.

2338
01:54:08,879 --> 01:54:10,353
PATRICK: I've been down this road before.

2339
01:54:10,353 --> 01:54:13,853
TRAVIS: (said extremely quickly) Don't you 
get advantage on those death saving throws?

2340
01:54:13,853 --> 01:54:15,683
PATRICK: (laughs) What was that?

2341
01:54:15,683 --> 01:54:17,459
MATT: Unfortunately, the spell that 
did that faded.

2342
01:54:17,459 --> 01:54:18,754
SAM: I think he's auctioning something 
over there.

2343
01:54:18,754 --> 01:54:21,413
TRAVIS: (auctioneer's babble)

2344
01:54:21,413 --> 01:54:22,739
PATRICK: Now, is that just a straight-up--

2345
01:54:22,739 --> 01:54:23,686
LIAM: Straight roll.

2346
01:54:23,686 --> 01:54:24,779
MATT: Just a straight d20.

2347
01:54:24,779 --> 01:54:25,964
LIAM: Seven.

2348
01:54:25,964 --> 01:54:27,065
PATRICK: Straight d20. Seven.

2349
01:54:27,065 --> 01:54:29,138
MATT: So that's one fail. So you've 
failed one death saving throw.

2350
01:54:29,138 --> 01:54:31,173
PATRICK: Well, you could call that 
a failure...

2351
01:54:31,173 --> 01:54:35,207
it really depends on what I'm trying 
to accomplish here.

2352
01:54:35,207 --> 01:54:36,741
MARISHA: Don't call it a comeback.

2353
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:38,861
SAM: In the Hindu faith, you would 
welcome it.

2354
01:54:38,861 --> 01:54:40,197
PATRICK: Yes, you know.

2355
01:54:40,197 --> 01:54:44,011
If what I'm trying to accomplish is a lot of 
drama, I consider that a great success in a roll.

2356
01:54:44,011 --> 01:54:50,181
MATT: All right, so Kima, as it's now 
Kima's turn, sees you on the ground,

2357
01:54:50,181 --> 01:54:55,916
convulsing from the blast of the impact, the 
giant crater in the ground where the meteors struck,

2358
01:54:55,916 --> 01:54:59,144
and hearing these blasts of arcane energy 
around the other side,

2359
01:54:59,144 --> 01:55:01,140
she has practically no vision of what's 
happening right now.

2360
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:05,721
All she sees is you down, and Grog run off, 
and she says, "C'mon, my bearded friend."

2361
01:55:05,721 --> 01:55:14,039
Runs up and is going to go ahead and hit
you with Lay on Hands for...

2362
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:20,499
let's see, for Kima she can do up to-- 
she's going to give you 30 hit points.

2363
01:55:20,499 --> 01:55:25,197
PATRICK: Oh, that's nice.

2364
01:55:25,197 --> 01:55:28,594
MATT: As you come to consciousness, 
you see the scarred halfling paladin

2365
01:55:28,594 --> 01:55:33,510
in her golden armor and half-cocked grin. 
"Come on, we still have work to do."

2366
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:34,960
Puts her hand down to try and lift you up.

2367
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,458
PATRICK: Okay.

2368
01:55:36,458 --> 01:55:39,168
MATT: We'll say for the sake of the fun of 
it, bonus action pulls you to your feet.

2369
01:55:39,168 --> 01:55:41,765
PATRICK: Okay, thank you.

2370
01:55:41,765 --> 01:55:44,585
MATT: All righty. That ends Kima's turn.

2371
01:55:44,585 --> 01:55:46,323
TRAVIS: Shit.

2372
01:55:46,323 --> 01:55:48,044
MATT: Allura has to make a death 
saving throw.

2373
01:55:48,044 --> 01:55:49,238
TRAVIS: No!

2374
01:55:49,238 --> 01:55:50,336
MATT: With a seven, that is a failure.

2375
01:55:50,336 --> 01:55:51,292
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2376
01:55:51,292 --> 01:55:52,164
MARISHA: Fuck!

2377
01:55:52,164 --> 01:55:54,691
MATT: She loses a death saving throw. 
That brings us to Pike.

2378
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:56,848
Pike I need to make roll a death 
saving throw.

2379
01:55:56,848 --> 01:55:58,180
LIAM: Do you want to do it? I'll do it.

2380
01:55:58,180 --> 01:55:59,298
TRAVIS: I could do it.

2381
01:55:59,298 --> 01:56:02,764
LIAM: Go for it.

2382
01:56:02,764 --> 01:56:05,399
TRAVIS: It's a five.

2383
01:56:05,399 --> 01:56:06,689
TALIESIN: God damn it.

2384
01:56:06,689 --> 01:56:07,999
MATT: Pike fails a death saving throw.

2385
01:56:07,999 --> 01:56:10,929
LAURA: Okay. Okay. Nobody else just 
willy-nilly make some rolls, okay.

2386
01:56:10,929 --> 01:56:12,206
MATT: Keyleth, it's your turn.

2387
01:56:12,206 --> 01:56:14,681
MARISHA: (nervous laughter) That's nice.

2388
01:56:14,681 --> 01:56:16,326
SAM: Do I need to make a death 
saving throw? No.

2389
01:56:16,326 --> 01:56:17,531
MATT: When it gets to your turn, you do.

2390
01:56:17,531 --> 01:56:18,767
SAM: Okay.

2391
01:56:18,767 --> 01:56:19,914
LIAM: New campaign next week.

2392
01:56:19,914 --> 01:56:21,540
(all laugh)

2393
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:28,504
MARISHA: Shut your fucking face right 
fucking now. Fuck me. Okay.

2394
01:56:28,504 --> 01:56:30,684
TRAVIS: Who's got the This Is A Bad 
Dream spell?

2395
01:56:30,684 --> 01:56:33,245
MARISHA: Okay.

2396
01:56:33,245 --> 01:56:35,413
TALIESIN: The Dallas? I don't have 
a Dallas left.

2397
01:56:35,413 --> 01:56:37,384
MATT: There is a spell for that. 
It's called Wish.

2398
01:56:37,384 --> 01:56:38,903
LAURA: Do we have any wishes?

2399
01:56:38,903 --> 01:56:40,780
SAM: Don't move, just heal.

2400
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:44,195
MARISHA: Laser pointer, laser pointer. 
Just shut up, laser pointer.

2401
01:56:44,195 --> 01:56:45,628
MATT: You going to try and draw a card?

2402
01:56:45,628 --> 01:56:46,559
TALIESIN: Travis.

2403
01:56:46,559 --> 01:56:47,786
MARISHA: Anybody laser pointer!

2404
01:56:47,786 --> 01:56:48,969
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry.

2405
01:56:48,969 --> 01:56:50,719
(Impressed noises.)

2406
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:53,002
MATT: That's my girl.

2407
01:56:53,002 --> 01:56:55,397
MARISHA: Who's-- shhh-- who's that?

2408
01:56:55,397 --> 01:56:56,679
MATT: That is the water fountain.

2409
01:56:56,679 --> 01:56:59,330
(all laugh)

2410
01:56:59,330 --> 01:57:01,163
MARISHA: All right, fuck that 
water fountain! All right.

2411
01:57:01,163 --> 01:57:02,920
TALIESIN: I've been wondering 
this whole time.

2412
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:05,687
TRAVIS: Who's that? It's a fountain.

2413
01:57:05,687 --> 01:57:06,988
MARISHA: Who's that?

2414
01:57:06,988 --> 01:57:08,337
TALIESIN: It was very lifelike.

2415
01:57:08,337 --> 01:57:13,323
MARISHA: Okay. Keyleth is very not okay, 
comes around the corner,

2416
01:57:13,323 --> 01:57:20,100
and I'm going to do, with my staff, and 
I'm going to pray to Melora and be like,

2417
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:23,436
"I know you hate this bitch as much 
as I do,"

2418
01:57:23,436 --> 01:57:27,893
and use my staff to do Firestorm right 
where I know she is.

2419
01:57:27,893 --> 01:57:29,586
MATT: Over here? All righty.

2420
01:57:29,586 --> 01:57:31,511
MARISHA: Just boof-boof-boof-boof--

2421
01:57:31,511 --> 01:57:32,860
MATT: Sure.

2422
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:34,474
SAM: What's the radius?

2423
01:57:34,474 --> 01:57:35,578
MARISHA: I get to pick.

2424
01:57:35,578 --> 01:57:36,676
SAM: Oh, thank god.

2425
01:57:36,676 --> 01:57:39,064
MATT: So you send fire sneaking 
all through there--

2426
01:57:39,064 --> 01:57:42,554
MARISHA: All of that, all through this 
area, just that whole tunnel gets lit up.

2427
01:57:42,554 --> 01:57:47,118
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of the Fog spell 
versus a seventh-level fire spell and the item,

2428
01:57:47,118 --> 01:57:51,696
the fog cloud is just burned off, it is 
done, it is gone.

2429
01:57:51,696 --> 01:57:57,578
All right, so roll that 7d10 fire damage. 
Saving throw... that is a failed save.

2430
01:57:57,578 --> 01:58:00,909
She will use her first legendary 
resistance.

2431
01:58:00,909 --> 01:58:02,764
LAURA: First?

2432
01:58:02,764 --> 01:58:04,050
MARISHA: First?

2433
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:04,958
MATT: To ignore that.

2434
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:05,926
TALIESIN: Burn 'em up.

2435
01:58:05,926 --> 01:58:07,057
MARISHA: 7d10?

2436
01:58:07,057 --> 01:58:08,327
MATT: 7d10 fire damage.

2437
01:58:08,327 --> 01:58:09,254
MARISHA: Five... do you have two more?

2438
01:58:09,254 --> 01:58:09,924
TALIESIN: I do.

2439
01:58:09,924 --> 01:58:13,312
LAURA: Did she gain them all back? Did she 
heal all the way? I mean, what's going on?

2440
01:58:13,312 --> 01:58:14,989
MATT: Yeah, she rested, she got 'em 
all back.

2441
01:58:14,989 --> 01:58:17,317
You guys rested a whole night to get 
your shit back, so did she.

2442
01:58:17,317 --> 01:58:19,160
LAURA: Well, fine.

2443
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,118
MATT: It's like enemies can do that too.

2444
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:22,071
LAURA: That's stupid.

2445
01:58:22,071 --> 01:58:23,855
MATT: Don't forget your staff's ability--

2446
01:58:23,855 --> 01:58:24,871
MARISHA: Reroll ones!

2447
01:58:24,871 --> 01:58:27,410
MATT: Yep.

2448
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:32,702
MARISHA: Which I have one that I will reroll, 
and it's a one. Do I get to reroll it again?

2449
01:58:32,702 --> 01:58:34,066
MATT: So you get to reroll it, yeah.

2450
01:58:34,066 --> 01:58:35,281
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

2451
01:58:35,281 --> 01:58:36,284
TALIESIN: There are no ones here.

2452
01:58:36,284 --> 01:58:37,147
MARISHA: That's better.

2453
01:58:37,147 --> 01:58:40,140
TALIESIN: That's much better.

2454
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:41,696
MARISHA: Nine... 12...

2455
01:58:41,696 --> 01:58:43,130
LAURA: I like how red your face is 
getting.

2456
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:51,882
MARISHA: Is it? Am I hot? I'm pale. I'm a redhead, 
so I show everything that happens. It's true. 17...

2457
01:58:51,882 --> 01:58:56,783
SAM: I don't think that came out right.

2458
01:58:56,783 --> 01:59:05,625
MARISHA: Don't worry about it. I'm distracted. 
God damn it. Now I'm distracted out of my math.

2459
01:59:05,625 --> 01:59:09,312
17 plus four is 21, correct?

2460
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:18,416
Plus another five is 26 plus another four 
is 30, plus another four is 34. 34 damage.

2461
01:59:18,416 --> 01:59:23,794
MATT: 34 damage. 17 points of fire damage.

2462
01:59:23,794 --> 01:59:25,746
MARISHA: Did you get hit?

2463
01:59:25,746 --> 01:59:27,228
SAM: No, that's half of 34.

2464
01:59:27,228 --> 01:59:28,480
TALIESIN: No, that's half.

2465
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,453
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. She saved.

2466
01:59:30,453 --> 01:59:35,370
MATT: So yeah, it succeeds.

2467
01:59:35,370 --> 01:59:38,528
MARISHA: Does it being a staff of Melora 
do anything?

2468
01:59:38,528 --> 01:59:42,485
MATT: No, other than the mention of the 
name caused the sound of growling in the distance.

2469
01:59:42,485 --> 01:59:50,832
"Why won't you all just stay down and 
die with dignity?"

2470
01:59:50,832 --> 01:59:52,610
LAURA: We don't do anything with dignity.

2471
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:55,067
(all laugh)

2472
01:59:55,067 --> 01:59:57,809
SAM: Scanlan's lifeless corpse has a 
pool of urine around it.

2473
01:59:57,809 --> 02:00:03,677
(all laugh)

2474
02:00:03,677 --> 02:00:11,363
MATT: All righty. Is that the end of your 
turn, Keyleth? Are you going to move forward?

2475
02:00:11,363 --> 02:00:14,534
MARISHA: I'm going to-- can I see Pike?

2476
02:00:14,534 --> 02:00:16,640
MATT: Pike is right there next to you, 
yeah.

2477
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:22,122
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to reach around 
the corner and do a Healing Word.

2478
02:00:22,122 --> 02:00:27,494
MATT: All right, Healing Word.

2479
02:00:27,494 --> 02:00:28,821
MARISHA: What, is it because I said 
"reach around"?

2480
02:00:28,821 --> 02:00:29,991
LAURA: No, no.

2481
02:00:29,991 --> 02:00:31,091
MATT: Not at all.

2482
02:00:31,091 --> 02:00:33,695
MARISHA: Jesus! Everything I say. 
Everything I say.

2483
02:00:33,695 --> 02:00:35,486
MATT: Level one, level two? What do 
you do?

2484
02:00:35,486 --> 02:00:38,655
MARISHA: Level one. Because I'm pale and 
I just show everything.

2485
02:00:38,655 --> 02:00:42,577
MATT: d4 plus six.

2486
02:00:42,577 --> 02:00:44,573
MARISHA: Nine.

2487
02:00:44,573 --> 02:00:47,741
MATT: Nine. So Pike heals nine hit points 
and is conscious.

2488
02:00:47,741 --> 02:00:52,709
TALIESIN: Clapping from the void.

2489
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:54,197
TRAVIS: It's because of that saving throw.

2490
02:00:54,197 --> 02:00:55,639
PATRICK: And that resets the death 
saving throw?

2491
02:00:55,639 --> 02:00:57,904
TALIESIN: Yeah, everything pops back.

2492
02:00:57,904 --> 02:01:00,939
MATT: All right. Bringing us back up 
to the top, Vax, you're up.

2493
02:01:00,939 --> 02:01:02,759
LIAM: Now, with the boots of haste,

2494
02:01:02,759 --> 02:01:05,467
one of the extra actions has to be for an 
attack, right? I couldn't do--

2495
02:01:05,467 --> 02:01:11,770
MATT: Correct. Well, it's attack, disengage, 
or dash, I think. It should say on the card.

2496
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:15,598
LIAM: Yeah, it says the extra action can be 
used to attack, dash, disengage, or hide.

2497
02:01:15,598 --> 02:01:28,307
Shite. So I'm going to... balls.

2498
02:01:28,307 --> 02:01:31,550
I'm going to go to the gnome on the 
ground and I'm going to cast Lay on Hands--

2499
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:32,983
LAURA: Which one?

2500
02:01:32,983 --> 02:01:34,128
LIAM: Pike is up, isn't she?

2501
02:01:34,128 --> 02:01:35,563
MATT: Pike is conscious.

2502
02:01:35,563 --> 02:01:38,834
LIAM: Conscious is what I mean. 
To Scanlan.

2503
02:01:38,834 --> 02:01:41,480
MATT: There you go.

2504
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:44,649
LIAM: And one hit point, just to 
get you up.

2505
02:01:44,649 --> 02:01:47,680
MATT: You're conscious.

2506
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:50,181
SAM: Is this my urine or someone else's?

2507
02:01:50,181 --> 02:01:51,894
PATRICK: Someone peed on me 
while I was dead!

2508
02:01:51,894 --> 02:01:53,456
(all laugh)

2509
02:01:53,456 --> 02:01:55,904
TRAVIS: (laughing) Is this my urine 
or someone else's?

2510
02:01:55,904 --> 02:01:58,481
SAM: I don't know which is worse.

2511
02:01:58,481 --> 02:02:06,923
TALIESIN: Only one way to find out. Does 
it taste like anything you've had recently?

2512
02:02:06,923 --> 02:02:10,657
SAM: Asparagus. That's me.

2513
02:02:10,657 --> 02:02:12,661
MATT: Oh, god. All right.

2514
02:02:12,661 --> 02:02:16,876
LIAM: I'm going to use a little more 
movement to move to the same spot

2515
02:02:16,876 --> 02:02:22,647
that Bigby's was before it was gone. 
Maybe into the-- the cloud's gone, right?

2516
02:02:22,647 --> 02:02:24,002
MATT: Cloud's gone, it got burned off 
in the Firestorm.

2517
02:02:24,002 --> 02:02:26,664
LIAM: Maybe I'll even go ten more
feet forward--

2518
02:02:26,664 --> 02:02:28,696
MATT: Okay, you slam into the physical 
form.

2519
02:02:28,696 --> 02:02:30,578
LIAM: Vow of Enmity.

2520
02:02:30,578 --> 02:02:31,597
MATT: Okay.

2521
02:02:31,597 --> 02:02:32,804
LIAM: As a bonus action.

2522
02:02:32,804 --> 02:02:33,871
MATT: All righty.

2523
02:02:33,871 --> 02:02:37,439
LIAM: And I will use the extra action to 
disengage and get the fuck out.

2524
02:02:37,439 --> 02:02:38,432
MATT: Okay.

2525
02:02:38,432 --> 02:02:39,299
TALIESIN: Whoa!

2526
02:02:39,299 --> 02:02:40,855
MARISHA: What's that? What's that? 
What'd you do?

2527
02:02:40,855 --> 02:02:42,352
MATT: Back up how far?

2528
02:02:42,352 --> 02:02:44,362
LIAM: I'm going to go that way. Back 
towards Scanlan.

2529
02:02:44,362 --> 02:02:46,904
MATT: This way? Okay.

2530
02:02:46,904 --> 02:02:50,213
LIAM: I should have 60 feet of 
movement hasted.

2531
02:02:50,213 --> 02:02:52,625
MATT: Yes, and as you back up--

2532
02:02:52,625 --> 02:02:53,712
LIAM: Disengage.

2533
02:02:53,712 --> 02:02:55,114
MATT: Yeah, disengage, yeah.

2534
02:02:55,114 --> 02:02:56,906
PATRICK: Nicely done.

2535
02:02:56,906 --> 02:02:59,756
LIAM: I will actually go along the wall.

2536
02:02:59,756 --> 02:03:00,816
MATT: So you'll be like over here.

2537
02:03:00,816 --> 02:03:04,181
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

2538
02:03:04,181 --> 02:03:07,767
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends your 
turn. Vex, you're up.

2539
02:03:07,767 --> 02:03:14,469
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to... Jesus Christ.

2540
02:03:14,469 --> 02:03:20,796
I'm going to run over to Allura and I'm 
going to cast 3rd-level Cure Wounds on her.

2541
02:03:20,796 --> 02:03:23,100
MATT: Okay. Healing her--

2542
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:35,415
LAURA: 3d8 plus three. Fifteen points.

2543
02:03:35,415 --> 02:03:38,798
MATT: All right.

2544
02:03:38,798 --> 02:03:51,887
LAURA: And then... 30 feet, no. Fuck! 
That's my action, isn't it?

2545
02:03:51,887 --> 02:03:53,349
MATT: Mm-hm.

2546
02:03:53,349 --> 02:04:02,888
LAURA: I guess as a bonus action I'm 
going to... hide? I'm such a loser.

2547
02:04:02,888 --> 02:04:05,263
MATT: So you're going to move over 
here and hide?

2548
02:04:05,263 --> 02:04:06,539
LAURA: Yeah? I guess?

2549
02:04:06,539 --> 02:04:08,401
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll a 
stealth check.

2550
02:04:08,401 --> 02:04:13,115
LAURA: Okay, let me see if I have any 
health potions left, though.

2551
02:04:13,115 --> 02:04:14,935
I have a regular healing potion left.

2552
02:04:14,935 --> 02:04:15,873
MATT: Go for it.

2553
02:04:15,873 --> 02:04:17,361
LAURA: So I'm going to take that.

2554
02:04:17,361 --> 02:04:18,987
MATT: It's 2d4 plus two.

2555
02:04:18,987 --> 02:04:29,451
LAURA: Ooh! Eight points healed.

2556
02:04:29,451 --> 02:04:31,076
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up.

2557
02:04:31,076 --> 02:04:32,467
LAURA: And a stealth check.

2558
02:04:32,467 --> 02:04:34,676
MATT: Stealth check, yes.

2559
02:04:34,676 --> 02:04:38,672
TALIESIN: Do I still have any theory of 
where she is,

2560
02:04:38,672 --> 02:04:40,520
or do I have to roll another perception 
check?

2561
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:44,000
MATT: I mean, just where she was 
previously standing.

2562
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,649
PATRICK: He just bumped into something.

2563
02:04:45,649 --> 02:04:47,341
LIAM: Yeah, you would've seen me go--

2564
02:04:47,341 --> 02:04:50,826
TALIESIN: So yeah, again, as I'm scootching 
further and further back along the wall,

2565
02:04:50,826 --> 02:04:55,052
I'm going to pull out the Animus box and 
take a few shots in there to see what happens.

2566
02:04:55,052 --> 02:04:57,438
MATT: Okay, disadvantage on all these 
strikes because she is invisible.

2567
02:04:57,438 --> 02:04:58,430
TALIESIN: Because she is invisible.

2568
02:04:58,430 --> 02:05:00,244
LIAM: Get it nerd, get it.

2569
02:05:00,244 --> 02:05:02,011
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to burn a grit 
for the first one to neutralize that.

2570
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:04,931
LAURA: Can I not have gone back behind the 
stalagmite, I want to go around the corner.

2571
02:05:04,931 --> 02:05:06,378
Yeah, like that.

2572
02:05:06,378 --> 02:05:08,277
MATT: That's as far as you can get, 
unfortunately.

2573
02:05:08,277 --> 02:05:10,805
LAURA: Okay. That's fine. I rolled a 16.

2574
02:05:10,805 --> 02:05:16,383
TALIESIN: So, shot number one. Natural 20.

2575
02:05:16,383 --> 02:05:19,494
MATT: Is this with disadvantage, or did 
you use the grit point?

2576
02:05:19,494 --> 02:05:21,760
TALIESIN: I used the grit point to cancel 
out the disadvantage.

2577
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:26,696
MATT: You did, all right. All right. 
Roll some damage.

2578
02:05:26,696 --> 02:05:30,179
TALIESIN: And that will not affect the 
Cabal's Ruin damage I was going to add to it,

2579
02:05:30,179 --> 02:05:32,613
because that's a different thing, right?

2580
02:05:32,613 --> 02:05:35,522
MATT: Um.

2581
02:05:35,522 --> 02:05:38,793
TALIESIN: Because that seems unfair 
because I can add that later.

2582
02:05:38,793 --> 02:05:42,473
MATT: Yeah, adding that to a crit is a 
little intense. I'd say no.

2583
02:05:42,473 --> 02:05:45,542
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm just going to add 
the standard damage.

2584
02:05:45,542 --> 02:05:48,379
I'm not going to crit the Cabal's Ruin 
damage, but I'm adding--

2585
02:05:48,379 --> 02:05:50,096
MATT: Correct.

2586
02:05:50,096 --> 02:05:51,958
LIAM: The dragon doesn't blow up?

2587
02:05:51,958 --> 02:05:56,703
TALIESIN: That's a thing.

2588
02:05:56,703 --> 02:05:59,650
MATT: The benefit is you can choose 
to apply it after the hit.

2589
02:05:59,650 --> 02:06:00,970
TALIESIN: After the hit.

2590
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:03,682
MATT: The downside is you can't 
add it to the crit.

2591
02:06:03,682 --> 02:06:06,738
TALIESIN: Totally worth it.

2592
02:06:06,738 --> 02:06:08,775
MATT: So you never waste it.

2593
02:06:08,775 --> 02:06:13,480
TALIESIN: No. So that's, let's see, 
that's six points of psychic damage.

2594
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,250
MATT: All righty.

2595
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:20,851
TALIESIN: And 18 points of normal damage.

2596
02:06:20,851 --> 02:06:24,017
MATT: So 24.

2597
02:06:24,017 --> 02:06:30,028
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to add 
three points of Cabal's Ruin, which is--

2598
02:06:30,028 --> 02:06:31,284
SAM: Whoa!

2599
02:06:31,284 --> 02:06:34,300
TALIESIN: 14 points of lightning damage.

2600
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:35,983
MATT: 38.

2601
02:06:35,983 --> 02:06:37,251
TALIESIN: Yep.

2602
02:06:37,251 --> 02:06:38,929
SAM: Does all that double because 
it was a crit?

2603
02:06:38,929 --> 02:06:41,790
TALIESIN: No. No, that is doubled.

2604
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:46,903
MATT: That's 38 points to that first hit. 
She's going to make a concentration check.

2605
02:06:46,903 --> 02:06:49,481
TALIESIN: And I also get my grit point 
back because I critted.

2606
02:06:49,481 --> 02:06:51,506
MATT: It's true.

2607
02:06:51,506 --> 02:06:53,240
LAURA: I think it's time for some Advil.

2608
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:55,415
(all laugh)

2609
02:06:55,415 --> 02:06:58,494
LAURA: Critical Role, brought to you 
by Advil.

2610
02:06:58,494 --> 02:07:01,199
MATT: Fails the concentration check 
on the invisibility.

2611
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:02,627
TALIESIN: Yes!

2612
02:07:02,627 --> 02:07:06,001
MATT: Is going to spend another legendary 
resistance to succeed it.

2613
02:07:06,001 --> 02:07:07,192
MARISHA: So she's spent two?

2614
02:07:07,192 --> 02:07:08,153
MATT: She's spent two.

2615
02:07:08,153 --> 02:07:09,252
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

2616
02:07:09,252 --> 02:07:12,609
TALIESIN: That's fine. Now for my second 
shot, I'm going to spend a second point to--

2617
02:07:12,609 --> 02:07:14,363
oh, she's not visible, she's--

2618
02:07:14,363 --> 02:07:16,188
MATT: Correct, she maintained 
concentration.

2619
02:07:16,188 --> 02:07:17,390
SAM: Did she blink into visibility?

2620
02:07:17,390 --> 02:07:18,460
MATT: No.

2621
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:20,255
TALIESIN: So I still have disadvantage 
so I still need to--

2622
02:07:20,255 --> 02:07:21,430
MATT: You do.

2623
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:22,670
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine.

2624
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:23,742
MATT: Are you doing another grit 
point to cancel it?

2625
02:07:23,742 --> 02:07:24,511
TALIESIN: Yep.

2626
02:07:24,511 --> 02:07:27,058
MATT: All right.

2627
02:07:27,058 --> 02:07:29,240
TALIESIN: Not quite as good, but 
still good. 27.

2628
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,867
MATT: 27 hits.

2629
02:07:30,867 --> 02:07:42,206
TALIESIN: So that's, ooh, that's nice. 
That's 17 points of normal damage.

2630
02:07:42,206 --> 02:07:43,513
MATT: All righty.

2631
02:07:43,513 --> 02:07:44,822
TALIESIN: Two points of psychic damage.

2632
02:07:44,822 --> 02:07:45,840
MATT: Okay.

2633
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:49,392
TALIESIN: And ten points of lightning 
damage.

2634
02:07:49,392 --> 02:07:51,490
MATT: All righty.

2635
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:54,373
TALIESIN: For my next shot--

2636
02:07:54,373 --> 02:07:58,407
MATT: Natural 20 on the save, so she 
saves concentration. It's maintained.

2637
02:07:58,407 --> 02:08:01,432
TALIESIN: I'm doing the same thing again, 
so I'm at two grit points.

2638
02:08:01,432 --> 02:08:03,637
MARISHA: Kill that resistance, kill that 
legendary resistance.

2639
02:08:03,637 --> 02:08:05,249
TALIESIN: I'm trying.

2640
02:08:05,249 --> 02:08:06,776
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

2641
02:08:06,776 --> 02:08:08,826
TALIESIN: Not going to hit, that's going 
to be 19 to hit. That doesn't hit.

2642
02:08:08,826 --> 02:08:09,986
MATT: No.

2643
02:08:09,986 --> 02:08:14,413
TALIESIN: So that one misses. I still have 
three Cabal's Ruin, though, so that's nice.

2644
02:08:14,413 --> 02:08:17,622
I'm going to use my bonus 
action for a heal surge,

2645
02:08:17,622 --> 02:08:19,980
for my little healing, my little 
pick-me-up.

2646
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,088
MATT: Great.

2647
02:08:21,088 --> 02:08:28,855
TALIESIN: So that's going to give me 
back 16 points of healing points,

2648
02:08:28,855 --> 02:08:34,672
so that's 16 to me, so that's... 
105, I'm at 105.

2649
02:08:34,672 --> 02:08:39,405
And I'm going to keep just scooting 
back along the wall.

2650
02:08:39,405 --> 02:08:45,577
I want to keep where I'm shooting in my 
line of sight, but I just want to get there.

2651
02:08:45,577 --> 02:08:47,157
Yeah, and still on the wall.

2652
02:08:47,157 --> 02:08:49,124
MATT: Okay, gotcha. That ends your 
turn, Percy?

2653
02:08:49,124 --> 02:08:50,056
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2654
02:08:50,056 --> 02:08:51,164
MATT: All righty.

2655
02:08:51,164 --> 02:08:52,496
MARISHA: Good turn, man, good turn.

2656
02:08:52,496 --> 02:08:54,346
TALIESIN: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2657
02:08:54,346 --> 02:08:56,506
MATT: It is now Raishan's turn.

2658
02:08:56,506 --> 02:08:59,846
SAM: Oh balls.

2659
02:08:59,846 --> 02:09:03,531
MATT: Let's see here.

2660
02:09:03,531 --> 02:09:08,883
TALIESIN: Look, every time I have a reaction 
I can do something. That's crazy. This is mean.

2661
02:09:08,883 --> 02:09:14,872
PATRICK: Can I see that?

2662
02:09:14,872 --> 02:09:26,429
MATT: Uh... hm. Raishan is fed up with this 
whole down-then-up, down-then-up yo-yoing.

2663
02:09:26,429 --> 02:09:29,059
TRAVIS: Good, flee, do it again!

2664
02:09:29,059 --> 02:09:31,924
MATT: Raishan, Scanlan, as you're on 
the ground,

2665
02:09:31,924 --> 02:09:36,909
just getting your bearings back to 
consciousness,

2666
02:09:36,909 --> 02:09:42,146
you watch as your head is across the 
ground, the rocks kind of (impact sound),

2667
02:09:42,146 --> 02:09:45,098
and something seems to hit the 
ground right next to you.

2668
02:09:45,098 --> 02:09:48,116
Raishan's going to do a full round of 
just physical attacks on you.

2669
02:09:48,116 --> 02:09:52,994
SAM: Great. It won't take very much 
since I've got the one hit point.

2670
02:09:52,994 --> 02:09:57,347
But maybe my 14 AC will protect me.

2671
02:09:57,347 --> 02:10:02,635
MATT: You are prone, so attack rolls on 
you have advantage within five feet,

2672
02:10:02,635 --> 02:10:05,010
which is good, because the first 
attack was a one.

2673
02:10:05,010 --> 02:10:18,510
And an 18 plus... so the first hit, which 
is its bite, hits you for 13 plus eight--

2674
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:20,126
SAM: I mean, I'm unconscious now.

2675
02:10:20,126 --> 02:10:21,878
TALIESIN: Do you have any reactions 
you can do?

2676
02:10:21,878 --> 02:10:25,717
SAM: I don't know. I can't remember 
when the last time I used a reaction was.

2677
02:10:25,717 --> 02:10:28,264
Was it this round or the round before?

2678
02:10:28,264 --> 02:10:31,004
MATT: Round before.

2679
02:10:31,004 --> 02:10:32,353
LAURA: So you could.

2680
02:10:32,353 --> 02:10:38,556
MATT: Well, your turn's next, so you 
have used it... no, you're right, it was,

2681
02:10:38,556 --> 02:10:41,968
it has been since the last time. 
So yeah. It was an 18 to hit.

2682
02:10:41,968 --> 02:10:43,225
LIAM: This could be the difference 
between--

2683
02:10:43,225 --> 02:10:44,504
MARISHA: Yeah, life and death.

2684
02:10:44,504 --> 02:10:45,981
LIAM: Because one or two death saves, 
three death saves.

2685
02:10:45,981 --> 02:10:47,123
SAM: All right.

2686
02:10:47,123 --> 02:10:50,071
LAURA: Because a full round is four 
attacks? Or three attacks?

2687
02:10:50,071 --> 02:10:52,368
MATT: For Raishan? You don't know.

2688
02:10:52,368 --> 02:10:54,953
LAURA: I bet it's four attacks.

2689
02:10:54,953 --> 02:10:56,572
LIAM: This is down to the wire, dude.

2690
02:10:56,572 --> 02:10:58,625
LAURA: This could be it, Scanlan!

2691
02:10:58,625 --> 02:11:00,623
MARISHA: Yeah, do it, do it. 
Do all you can.

2692
02:11:00,623 --> 02:11:02,768
SAM: Okay, I'll say to Raishan this time,

2693
02:11:02,768 --> 02:11:08,084
"You so dumb, when thieves stole your 
horse, you chased them down and said,

2694
02:11:08,084 --> 02:11:09,921
"'You forgot the saddle!'"

2695
02:11:09,921 --> 02:11:11,876
(all laugh)

2696
02:11:11,876 --> 02:11:17,937
MATT: He utters, with a weak breath on 
the floor of the necromancer's sanctum.

2697
02:11:17,937 --> 02:11:19,600
LAURA: These could be Scanlan's 
final words.

2698
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:22,954
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d12, please.

2699
02:11:22,954 --> 02:11:25,115
MARISHA: Come on, Scanlan.

2700
02:11:25,115 --> 02:11:26,494
SAM: Six.

2701
02:11:26,494 --> 02:11:28,223
MATT: So it's 18 minus six is a 12.

2702
02:11:28,223 --> 02:11:30,623
(All cheer.)

2703
02:11:30,623 --> 02:11:32,577
MATT: So whoosh.

2704
02:11:32,577 --> 02:11:34,130
MARISHA: You did it with your shitty 
retort.

2705
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:36,503
SAM: Now just three more attacks 
to dodge and I'll be okay.

2706
02:11:36,503 --> 02:11:38,556
LIAM: That was the bite, wasn't it?

2707
02:11:38,556 --> 02:11:41,253
MATT: There's two more claw attacks.

2708
02:11:41,253 --> 02:11:44,890
LAURA: Raishan gets four attacks, 
so if you would've failed that,

2709
02:11:44,890 --> 02:11:46,599
your instant death save would've failed.

2710
02:11:46,599 --> 02:11:48,505
MATT: So that's 21 to hit.

2711
02:11:48,505 --> 02:11:49,854
SAM: Oh, that'll hit, sure.

2712
02:11:49,854 --> 02:11:53,624
MATT: So with that you take 4d6 
plus eight.

2713
02:11:53,624 --> 02:11:55,142
TALIESIN: Let's just call it.

2714
02:11:55,142 --> 02:12:01,176
MATT: Yeah, you're unconscious. 
And the final claw attack has advantage,

2715
02:12:01,176 --> 02:12:05,374
which hits you, and it's a crit. So you 
lose two death saving throws.

2716
02:12:05,374 --> 02:12:09,947
TALIESIN: We're going to have to deal 
with that very, very quickly.

2717
02:12:09,947 --> 02:12:11,772
TRAVIS: Where are you? Can you point 
to him on the map?

2718
02:12:11,772 --> 02:12:13,025
SAM: I'm the pink one.

2719
02:12:13,025 --> 02:12:17,055
MATT: Right there. And the impact seems 
to be coming from this area, here.

2720
02:12:17,055 --> 02:12:20,103
SAM: So wait, they can see my body 
sort of like moving?

2721
02:12:20,103 --> 02:12:21,802
MATT: Yeah, getting hit on the ground.

2722
02:12:21,802 --> 02:12:23,564
MARISHA: We can see him getting 
beat the shit out of.

2723
02:12:23,564 --> 02:12:25,542
MATT: Getting mangled by something 
that's not currently there.

2724
02:12:25,542 --> 02:12:34,611
And then (whooshing sounds), the wind kicks 
up as something seems to shift the air.

2725
02:12:34,611 --> 02:12:37,027
LAURA: Can anybody feel it flying past?

2726
02:12:37,027 --> 02:12:39,848
MATT: You can feel it move in this 
direction.

2727
02:12:39,848 --> 02:12:41,702
LAURA: Great.

2728
02:12:41,702 --> 02:12:48,203
MATT: With that, yeah, I can just make it 
through without an attack of opportunity--

2729
02:12:48,203 --> 02:12:51,636
LIAM: Yeah, can I do an attack of 
opportunity as it flies by?

2730
02:12:51,636 --> 02:12:54,929
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm right there too.

2731
02:12:54,929 --> 02:12:58,907
MATT: You sense it not far enough from 
you to be able to

2732
02:12:58,907 --> 02:13:00,902
attack something with an attack of 
opportunity.

2733
02:13:00,902 --> 02:13:02,653
LIAM: All right.

2734
02:13:02,653 --> 02:13:05,329
MATT: That ends Raishan's turn. 
Scanlan. Death saving throw.

2735
02:13:05,329 --> 02:13:07,787
LAURA: Oh my god, oh my god.

2736
02:13:07,787 --> 02:13:11,701
SAM: Three.

2737
02:13:11,701 --> 02:13:18,356
MATT: And with that, the breath escapes 
Scanlan's lungs, the smile across his face,

2738
02:13:18,356 --> 02:13:21,018
as life leaves his form.

2739
02:13:21,018 --> 02:13:23,913
SAM: This time I died with a bad joke 
and piss all over me.

2740
02:13:23,913 --> 02:13:26,180
(All laughing.)

2741
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:28,991
MATT: He died as he lived: hard or after 
a bad joke with piss all over him.

2742
02:13:28,991 --> 02:13:37,990
All right. That ends Scanlan's turn. 
Grog, you're up.

2743
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:48,709
TRAVIS: Yeah. Uh. Dragon moved. 
Scanlan dead. (raspberry)

2744
02:13:48,709 --> 02:13:52,060
Did I detect which direction el dragon 
flew in?

2745
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:53,460
MATT: Roll a perception check.

2746
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:59,355
TRAVIS: Yeah. Sure. Three.

2747
02:13:59,355 --> 02:14:02,271
MATT: You're not entirely certain.

2748
02:14:02,271 --> 02:14:09,323
You just saw something (whoosh) through 
the air in this vicinity.

2749
02:14:09,323 --> 02:14:14,056
TRAVIS: I am just going to throw a hammer 
in that direction.

2750
02:14:14,056 --> 02:14:15,119
MATT: Okay.

2751
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:16,297
TRAVIS: In there.

2752
02:14:16,297 --> 02:14:17,536
MATT: Roll with disadvantage.

2753
02:14:17,536 --> 02:14:20,675
TRAVIS: Yup. Can I make it reckless?

2754
02:14:20,675 --> 02:14:22,292
MATT: Sure.

2755
02:14:22,292 --> 02:14:25,529
TRAVIS: One roll? Does that zero out 
the disadvantage?

2756
02:14:25,529 --> 02:14:26,356
MATT: Yep.

2757
02:14:26,356 --> 02:14:27,313
TRAVIS: Okay.

2758
02:14:27,313 --> 02:14:29,506
MATT: She has a higher AC because she's 
technically heavily obscured.

2759
02:14:29,506 --> 02:14:33,988
TRAVIS: Right. 27.

2760
02:14:33,988 --> 02:14:42,700
MATT: 27? 27 just hits. You got lucky and 
just flung it out in the middle of nowhere,

2761
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:46,159
because of the AC bonus of her being heavily 
obscured. So yeah, go ahead and roll damage.

2762
02:14:46,159 --> 02:14:48,325
TRAVIS: Nice. That's good.

2763
02:14:48,325 --> 02:14:51,597
PATRICK: Now you have a better idea of 
where she is.

2764
02:14:51,597 --> 02:14:53,954
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I keep track of 
where it hit her--

2765
02:14:53,954 --> 02:14:55,635
LIAM: Can we all see the hammer fly 
through the air?

2766
02:14:55,635 --> 02:14:57,076
MATT: You can see the hammer 
impact somewhere,

2767
02:14:57,076 --> 02:14:58,621
and you watch it somewhere right up here.

2768
02:14:58,621 --> 02:15:00,392
LAURA: Great.

2769
02:15:00,392 --> 02:15:02,582
MATT: Like, right above you.

2770
02:15:02,582 --> 02:15:04,301
TRAVIS: 23.

2771
02:15:04,301 --> 02:15:05,343
MATT: 23 damage.

2772
02:15:05,343 --> 02:15:07,543
TRAVIS: 23 damage.

2773
02:15:07,543 --> 02:15:16,407
MATT: Okay. Maintains concentration. 
Hammer comes back.

2774
02:15:16,407 --> 02:15:19,111
TRAVIS: Can I be thrilled that I hit 
something that I didn't see

2775
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:22,833
and smash the Titanstone Knuckles 
together to enlarge?

2776
02:15:22,833 --> 02:15:32,439
MATT: Sure. With that, your hammer 
grows in size as well.

2777
02:15:32,439 --> 02:15:34,359
TRAVIS: Can I try and throw the hammer 
again?

2778
02:15:34,359 --> 02:15:35,147
MATT: You can.

2779
02:15:35,147 --> 02:15:40,423
TRAVIS: At the same general area. One roll. 
Unless I know where she is now, but I doubt that.

2780
02:15:40,423 --> 02:15:42,331
MATT: I mean, you're still at 
disadvantage on the attacks.

2781
02:15:42,331 --> 02:15:44,438
But you're going reckless, so it's all
just straight hits.

2782
02:15:44,438 --> 02:15:46,144
TRAVIS: That's a one, so I'm, no.

2783
02:15:46,144 --> 02:15:48,389
MATT: On both? With reckless?

2784
02:15:48,389 --> 02:15:51,034
TRAVIS: I thought I couldn't see her, so 
it was disadvantage,

2785
02:15:51,034 --> 02:15:52,701
reckless advantage, so just a single--

2786
02:15:52,701 --> 02:16:00,746
MATT: Oh right, yeah. Misses past, breaks 
into the rock and stone off the wall.

2787
02:16:00,746 --> 02:16:02,761
TRAVIS: That's better. 31.

2788
02:16:02,761 --> 02:16:03,923
MATT: That hits.

2789
02:16:03,923 --> 02:16:15,846
TRAVIS: Okay. 18... 26... plus four for 
enlarged... 25. 25 damage.

2790
02:16:15,846 --> 02:16:18,858
MATT: 25 damage.

2791
02:16:18,858 --> 02:16:22,409
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, I'm freaking 
out right now.

2792
02:16:22,409 --> 02:16:30,776
MATT: She fails her saving throw. 
Concentration...

2793
02:16:30,776 --> 02:16:34,323
no, she wants to maintain that spell, 
so that's her last legendary resistance.

2794
02:16:34,323 --> 02:16:36,253
MARISHA: Yeah, Grog! Yeah!

2795
02:16:36,253 --> 02:16:40,687
MATT: But she maintains concentration 
on the invisibility. So that was 25.

2796
02:16:40,687 --> 02:16:43,358
TRAVIS: 25, I think.

2797
02:16:43,358 --> 02:16:46,951
MATT: Yeah, I got it. So that's the end 
of your turn, Grog?

2798
02:16:46,951 --> 02:16:48,414
TRAVIS: Yes, it is.

2799
02:16:48,414 --> 02:16:51,117
MATT: Okay. You can move if you'd like. 
You just threw, it's all you did.

2800
02:16:51,117 --> 02:16:58,341
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Yeah, I'm going to 
move in the direction that she flew.

2801
02:16:58,341 --> 02:17:01,390
MATT: Something hits your head as 
you get about there.

2802
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:04,107
TRAVIS: Ah! I get angry again.

2803
02:17:04,107 --> 02:17:30,528
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Grog. 
At the... hm. Yeah. At the end of your turn...

2804
02:17:30,528 --> 02:17:33,751
TRAVIS: Not a word. Not a word.

2805
02:17:33,751 --> 02:17:44,152
(Nervous laughing.)

2806
02:17:44,152 --> 02:17:47,239
MATT: It's going to go ahead and--

2807
02:17:47,239 --> 02:17:48,732
SAM: Surrender.

2808
02:17:48,732 --> 02:17:49,869
LAURA: She surrenders.

2809
02:17:49,869 --> 02:17:52,047
MATT: It's too close now. 
Yeah, just, we're done!

2810
02:17:52,047 --> 02:17:53,938
LIAM: Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry.

2811
02:17:53,938 --> 02:17:56,662
PATRICK: Did we mention that this 
is all subduing damage?

2812
02:17:56,662 --> 02:17:58,375
MATT: (laughs)

2813
02:17:58,375 --> 02:18:02,031
PATRICK: So glad you got that joke.

2814
02:18:02,031 --> 02:18:05,746
MATT: Ah, subdual damage. Back in the day.

2815
02:18:05,746 --> 02:18:07,483
TALIESIN: It was a kinder, gentler world.

2816
02:18:07,483 --> 02:18:11,825
MATT: I know. She's not going to 
use that ability yet.

2817
02:18:11,825 --> 02:18:18,645
Instead is going to... oh, everyone's 
kind of moving around her.

2818
02:18:18,645 --> 02:18:20,939
TALIESIN: I'd give money for a 
popcorn grenade right now.

2819
02:18:20,939 --> 02:18:25,185
MATT: Okay, you know? Is going to use two 
legendary actions to use a wing attack.

2820
02:18:25,185 --> 02:18:27,348
TRAVIS: Two legendary actions.

2821
02:18:27,348 --> 02:18:31,423
MATT: So the wings start 
beating furiously in the air.

2822
02:18:31,423 --> 02:18:42,222
I need Vax, Kima, Grog, and Vex to 
make a dexterity saving throw.

2823
02:18:42,222 --> 02:18:49,931
TRAVIS: Minus two, because, 
yeah. But advantage.

2824
02:18:49,931 --> 02:18:56,125
MATT: Wow. Allura actually made it.

2825
02:18:56,125 --> 02:19:00,850
SAM: Vex. (coughs) Inspiration.

2826
02:19:00,850 --> 02:19:02,013
LAURA: Doesn't matter.

2827
02:19:02,013 --> 02:19:10,223
SAM: What?

2828
02:19:10,223 --> 02:19:13,566
MATT: That is a shitty roll. 
All right, so.

2829
02:19:13,566 --> 02:19:14,626
LIAM: 27.

2830
02:19:14,626 --> 02:19:15,908
MATT: 27, so.

2831
02:19:15,908 --> 02:19:17,173
LIAM: Zero.

2832
02:19:17,173 --> 02:19:22,215
MATT: You take no damage. Vex? One!

2833
02:19:22,215 --> 02:19:26,646
You take 13 points of bludgeoning 
damage and you are knocked prone.

2834
02:19:26,646 --> 02:19:28,114
SAM: Are you still alive?

2835
02:19:28,114 --> 02:19:30,152
LAURA: I'm still alive, you guys!

2836
02:19:30,152 --> 02:19:31,358
SAM: Wow.

2837
02:19:31,358 --> 02:19:34,160
LAURA: Still standing. I'm not 
standing. Still--

2838
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:37,850
MATT: Allura succeeds and takes 
no damage. Grog, what'd you roll?

2839
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:39,516
TRAVIS: 17.

2840
02:19:39,516 --> 02:19:46,519
MATT: 17. Grog, you also, you take 13 points 
of bludgeoning damage and you're knocked prone.

2841
02:19:46,519 --> 02:19:47,488
TRAVIS: Halved, halved.

2842
02:19:47,488 --> 02:19:48,329
MATT: Yes.

2843
02:19:48,329 --> 02:19:49,326
TRAVIS: Six.

2844
02:19:49,326 --> 02:19:50,984
LAURA: Did you say 21 points of damage?

2845
02:19:50,984 --> 02:19:51,983
MATT: 13.

2846
02:19:51,983 --> 02:19:53,110
LAURA: Oh, that's it? 13.

2847
02:19:53,110 --> 02:19:59,629
MATT: Yep. And the dragon moves 
half its flying speed.

2848
02:19:59,629 --> 02:20:01,242
LIAM: Is it close, ah.

2849
02:20:01,242 --> 02:20:02,845
MATT: Yeah, just moves away at--

2850
02:20:02,848 --> 02:20:04,218
TALIESIN: Do I get an attack of 
opportunity?

2851
02:20:04,231 --> 02:20:06,447
MATT: People who are not prone, yes.

2852
02:20:06,455 --> 02:20:09,515
So Vax, you get to make an attack of 
opportunity with disadvantage.

2853
02:20:09,515 --> 02:20:11,678
LIAM: Oh, okay.

2854
02:20:11,678 --> 02:20:13,459
LAURA: Oh, damn it. Sucks that you 
were knocked prone.

2855
02:20:14,561 --> 02:20:15,345
TRAVIS: I know.

2856
02:20:15,643 --> 02:20:17,390
LIAM: I'm going to use one Luck.

2857
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:18,861
MATT: Okay.

2858
02:20:18,861 --> 02:20:22,073
LIAM: What does that mean, if I use luck? 
Disadvantage, and then I rolled a six and--

2859
02:20:22,073 --> 02:20:23,519
MATT: Your Vow of Enmity gives it 
advantage, though, doesn't it?

2860
02:20:23,519 --> 02:20:24,512
LIAM: Say again?

2861
02:20:24,512 --> 02:20:25,683
MATT: Your Vow of Enmity?

2862
02:20:25,683 --> 02:20:27,541
LIAM: That's right, it does.
So that cancels out.

2863
02:20:27,541 --> 02:20:29,184
So the first one-- but I'm still using
Luck,

2864
02:20:29,184 --> 02:20:32,520
so the first one was a six, the 
second one was a 31.

2865
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:34,035
MATT: 31 hits. Yeah.

2866
02:20:34,035 --> 02:20:37,508
LAURA: Yay!

2867
02:20:37,508 --> 02:20:38,711
TRAVIS: Hit him!

2868
02:20:38,711 --> 02:20:39,772
SAM: Her.

2869
02:20:39,772 --> 02:20:40,893
LAURA: Hit her!

2870
02:20:40,893 --> 02:20:44,429
TRAVIS: Her!

2871
02:20:44,429 --> 02:20:54,471
LIAM: Nine plus psychic damage... ten. 25.

2872
02:20:54,471 --> 02:20:58,795
MATT: 25 points of damage.

2873
02:20:58,795 --> 02:21:00,652
PATRICK: One more.

2874
02:21:00,652 --> 02:21:02,518
TRAVIS: Kill all the other dice.

2875
02:21:02,518 --> 02:21:06,181
MATT: Yeah, maintains concentration 
and pulls away.

2876
02:21:06,181 --> 02:21:08,383
TALIESIN: Do I get an attack of 
opportunity?

2877
02:21:08,383 --> 02:21:10,438
MATT: No. She hasn't moved past you.

2878
02:21:10,438 --> 02:21:12,542
TALIESIN: She has not moved past me.

2879
02:21:12,542 --> 02:21:18,911
MATT: Nope. All right. That ends that turn. 
Kerrek, you're up.

2880
02:21:18,911 --> 02:21:25,567
PATRICK: I'm assuming-- yeah, I've got 
to be hearing that over on that side.

2881
02:21:25,567 --> 02:21:29,213
MATT: Yeah, you're hearing all the impacts, 
the slashing, the battle on this side.

2882
02:21:29,213 --> 02:21:35,618
PATRICK: Okay. Boy, 30 move. I can 
dash, right?

2883
02:21:35,618 --> 02:21:38,163
MATT: You can, yeah, as an action, so 
you can do twice your movement.

2884
02:21:38,163 --> 02:21:41,728
PATRICK: Oh, so you just-- it's a movement, 
and then I burn my action to do another movement?

2885
02:21:41,728 --> 02:21:43,640
MATT: Correct, yeah.

2886
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:51,524
PATRICK: How far over does... how far 
over does 30 get me there?

2887
02:21:51,524 --> 02:21:56,438
MATT: 30 would just get around the 
corner here.

2888
02:21:56,438 --> 02:22:02,266
PATRICK: Can I get 25 and just-- 
actually, I don't know she's invisible.

2889
02:22:02,266 --> 02:22:04,535
So I go, dragon's coming around the 
corner,

2890
02:22:04,535 --> 02:22:11,541
I want to hang at the corner and 
then effectively wait to attack.

2891
02:22:11,541 --> 02:22:13,896
MATT: So you're holding your action in 
case something shows up that you can hit.

2892
02:22:13,896 --> 02:22:16,478
PATRICK: Yep. Well, actually, I'm going 
to be around this corner,

2893
02:22:16,478 --> 02:22:18,977
waiting for it to come into this.

2894
02:22:18,977 --> 02:22:22,721
MATT: Right there? Okay.

2895
02:22:22,721 --> 02:22:35,819
PATRICK: Gosh, I think... 
I think that's all I got.

2896
02:22:35,819 --> 02:22:43,525
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends 
Kerrek's turn. Let's see here.

2897
02:22:43,525 --> 02:22:48,505
Kima sees you doing this and is going to go 
ahead and back you up right there. Sorry, Percy.

2898
02:22:48,505 --> 02:22:50,374
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2899
02:22:50,374 --> 02:22:59,318
MATT: Spiderclimb makes you so easy 
to knock over. Kima, on her turn...

2900
02:22:59,318 --> 02:23:06,785
is going to use Aura of Vitality again on 
herself and, utilizing that as a bonus action,

2901
02:23:06,785 --> 02:23:16,795
is going to heal you for 2d6, Kerrek. So-- 
oh, not bad. 11 hit points. All righty.

2902
02:23:16,795 --> 02:23:19,681
That ends Kima's turn. Allura.

2903
02:23:19,681 --> 02:23:29,453
Allura, who is barely conscious with 15 
hit points, is going to get to her feet.

2904
02:23:29,453 --> 02:23:35,971
Perception check... natural 20.

2905
02:23:35,971 --> 02:23:37,952
MARISHA: Allura is bae!

2906
02:23:37,952 --> 02:23:39,752
(all laugh)

2907
02:23:39,752 --> 02:23:41,554
MATT: And is going to-- no, not 
third-level.

2908
02:23:41,554 --> 02:23:46,341
She's going to go ahead and cast 
a fifth-level Dispel Magic.

2909
02:23:46,341 --> 02:23:59,364
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah.

2910
02:23:59,364 --> 02:24:03,382
MATT: Which would-- yeah, it's 
just dispelled. And with that.

2911
02:24:03,382 --> 02:24:04,937
LAURA: Finally!

2912
02:24:04,937 --> 02:24:07,937
MATT: Finally revealed on the field.

2913
02:24:07,937 --> 02:24:10,684
LAURA: And she's just like covered in 
blood, she's just so beat-up.

2914
02:24:10,684 --> 02:24:13,221
MARISHA: Yeah, she's barely hanging on.

2915
02:24:13,221 --> 02:24:14,782
LIAM: She's looking pretty rough.

2916
02:24:14,782 --> 02:24:17,065
MARISHA: She's got a single tear 
coming from her eye.

2917
02:24:17,065 --> 02:24:18,799
LAURA: Oh god, she's like right there.

2918
02:24:18,799 --> 02:24:20,217
TALIESIN: (nervous exclamation)

2919
02:24:20,217 --> 02:24:24,607
LIAM: Look out, Perce.

2920
02:24:24,607 --> 02:24:26,416
TALIESIN: I get the idea.

2921
02:24:26,416 --> 02:24:27,558
LIAM: Put a counterweight.

2922
02:24:27,558 --> 02:24:31,056
MATT: Further over, just appears right 
in front of your face, Percival.

2923
02:24:31,056 --> 02:24:32,469
LAURA: Just her butt.

2924
02:24:32,469 --> 02:24:36,302
MATT: (menacing growl, wing-sounds)

2925
02:24:36,302 --> 02:24:45,667
And then Allura, using the rest of her 
movement, is going to here, here, here,

2926
02:24:45,667 --> 02:24:52,413
and then actually Misty Step over here 
next to Keyleth to get out of the area.

2927
02:24:52,413 --> 02:24:57,127
(breathing hard) "Keyleth, you have 
to finish this."

2928
02:24:57,127 --> 02:24:59,703
MARISHA: Okay?!

2929
02:24:59,703 --> 02:25:02,615
MATT: That's going to end Allura's turn. 
Pike is up.

2930
02:25:02,615 --> 02:25:05,364
LAURA: Pike. Okay.

2931
02:25:05,364 --> 02:25:06,847
MARISHA: Is she still unconscious?

2932
02:25:06,847 --> 02:25:12,530
LAURA: No, she's up. She's going to stand 
up and, if she uses her sprinter's boots,

2933
02:25:12,530 --> 02:25:20,893
can she run over to Scanlan and cast 
Revivify? Would she be able to get to him?

2934
02:25:20,893 --> 02:25:23,325
MATT: She would just get to his side, 
yeah.

2935
02:25:23,325 --> 02:25:25,958
LAURA: Okay, then she's going to 
cast Revivify on Scanlan.

2936
02:25:25,958 --> 02:25:31,329
MATT: All right, so. Go ahead and roll 
a d20 and add her wisdom modifier.

2937
02:25:31,329 --> 02:25:35,267
TALIESIN: Do you also have inspiration 
still?

2938
02:25:35,267 --> 02:25:36,658
LAURA: Pike didn't have it.

2939
02:25:36,658 --> 02:25:38,200
TALIESIN: No, Pike, oh-- okay.

2940
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:40,601
MATT: He died twice, the DC is 12.

2941
02:25:40,601 --> 02:25:41,950
LAURA: So...

2942
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:43,962
LIAM: Plus her wisdom, whatever you 
roll plus the wisdom.

2943
02:25:43,962 --> 02:25:47,811
MATT: Yeah, so d20 plus five.

2944
02:25:47,811 --> 02:25:49,334
LAURA: (small voice) Nine.

2945
02:25:49,334 --> 02:25:50,806
MATT: Nine, okay.

2946
02:25:50,806 --> 02:25:52,263
TRAVIS: What?

2947
02:25:52,263 --> 02:25:54,404
MATT: So the Revivify fails. Reaches out 
and doesn't hit.

2948
02:25:54,404 --> 02:25:56,695
LAURA: God fucking damn it!

2949
02:25:56,695 --> 02:25:58,683
MATT: You're still dead.

2950
02:25:58,683 --> 02:26:04,129
You're not permanently dead, but you cannot 
be revived for the remainder of this battle.

2951
02:26:04,129 --> 02:26:07,537
You can only use a ritual to return, and 
the DC does go up to a 13.

2952
02:26:07,537 --> 02:26:09,936
TALIESIN: Okay, okay.

2953
02:26:09,936 --> 02:26:11,986
SAM: Ritual of return?

2954
02:26:11,986 --> 02:26:13,477
TALIESIN: It's the last-ditch.

2955
02:26:13,477 --> 02:26:15,147
SAM: Okay.

2956
02:26:15,147 --> 02:26:17,534
MATT: Currently, you get--

2957
02:26:17,534 --> 02:26:21,146
Pike touches and releases the 
energy of the spell into Scanlan's body,

2958
02:26:21,146 --> 02:26:25,387
and you feel the necrotic essence of 
this necromancer's sanctum,

2959
02:26:25,387 --> 02:26:28,635
the very dark nature of this place,

2960
02:26:28,635 --> 02:26:33,126
is preventing the connection between the 
spirit and the body of Scanlan at the moment.

2961
02:26:33,126 --> 02:26:43,381
The spell having no effect. Pike still 
has a bonus action if she'd like.

2962
02:26:43,381 --> 02:26:51,789
LAURA: She's going to throw Sacred 
Flame at Raishan.

2963
02:26:51,789 --> 02:26:53,201
MATT: Okay.

2964
02:26:53,201 --> 02:26:55,012
LAURA: And that's at 17th level, 
which she's at now, right?

2965
02:26:55,012 --> 02:26:57,411
MATT: Sacred Flame is an action.

2966
02:26:57,411 --> 02:26:58,668
LAURA: It is.

2967
02:26:58,668 --> 02:27:01,369
MATT: Needs to be a bonus action, 
unfortunately.

2968
02:27:01,369 --> 02:27:16,251
LAURA: Balls. Great. Tight. She-- 
can she do like a heal--

2969
02:27:16,251 --> 02:27:17,935
MATT: She can do a Healing Word.

2970
02:27:17,935 --> 02:27:20,672
LAURA: Healing Word, tight. She's 
going to do that on herself, then.

2971
02:27:20,672 --> 02:27:21,730
MATT: Level two?

2972
02:27:21,730 --> 02:27:22,783
LAURA: Sure.

2973
02:27:22,783 --> 02:27:34,198
MATT: All right, so 2d4 plus five.

2974
02:27:34,198 --> 02:27:35,844
LAURA: 11.

2975
02:27:35,844 --> 02:27:43,186
MATT: 11. All righty, so that heals 
her up.

2976
02:27:43,186 --> 02:27:51,844
PATRICK: God. If I can just fucking get 
close enough to stick one on her.

2977
02:27:51,844 --> 02:27:53,683
TALIESIN: I'm going to get stupid, so.

2978
02:27:53,683 --> 02:27:55,123
MARISHA: I know, samesies.

2979
02:27:55,123 --> 02:28:00,801
MATT: All right, that ends Pike's turn. 
Keyleth, you're up.

2980
02:28:00,801 --> 02:28:03,554
TALIESIN: Well. Things have gotten 
simpler.

2981
02:28:03,554 --> 02:28:08,361
MARISHA: Okay. Hearing Allura's words 
and seeing Scanlan down,

2982
02:28:08,361 --> 02:28:16,413
can I get a movement to where I can get over 
here and see her? Keep going, keep going.

2983
02:28:16,413 --> 02:28:17,747
MATT: You can see her there.

2984
02:28:17,747 --> 02:28:18,899
MARISHA: I can see her there?

2985
02:28:18,899 --> 02:28:20,416
MATT: Yes.

2986
02:28:20,416 --> 02:28:22,402
MARISHA: I'm assuming she's within 
150 feet of me.

2987
02:28:22,402 --> 02:28:25,597
MATT: Yes.

2988
02:28:25,597 --> 02:28:31,762
MARISHA: This is kind of like a hail mary. 
Oh, jesus fuck. All right.

2989
02:28:31,762 --> 02:28:42,945
I am going to cast... (laughs) my one 8th-level 
spell, and I'm going to attempt to Feeblemind her.

2990
02:28:42,945 --> 02:28:44,848
PATRICK: Oh, she's used up all her 
legendary saves.

2991
02:28:44,848 --> 02:28:47,386
MARISHA: Exactly. Exactly.

2992
02:28:47,386 --> 02:28:51,730
MATT: All righty. And it is an 
intelligence saving throw--

2993
02:28:51,730 --> 02:28:53,422
LAURA: Oh, she's really smart.

2994
02:28:53,422 --> 02:28:56,664
MARISHA: Yes, which she's really good at, 
but we could get lucky.

2995
02:28:56,664 --> 02:29:00,772
MATT: Four plus four. Rolled a four.

2996
02:29:00,772 --> 02:29:04,828
She has an intelligence modifier of four, 
and it is not one of her saving throws.

2997
02:29:04,828 --> 02:29:06,128
MARISHA: Shut up!

2998
02:29:06,128 --> 02:29:07,610
MATT: Her intelligence and charisma 
become one,

2999
02:29:07,610 --> 02:29:10,627
cannot cast spells, cannot activate 
magical items.

3000
02:29:10,627 --> 02:29:12,109
PATRICK: Up top, up top!

3001
02:29:12,109 --> 02:29:15,284
MARISHA: Oh my god! Oh my god! 
Oh my god!

3002
02:29:15,284 --> 02:29:17,015
TRAVIS: Did that really happen? 
Did that work?

3003
02:29:17,015 --> 02:29:18,774
MATT: Yeah.

3004
02:29:18,774 --> 02:29:21,931
SAM: It's permanent, right? For 30 days.

3005
02:29:21,931 --> 02:29:23,610
MARISHA: She can keep saving from it.

3006
02:29:23,610 --> 02:29:25,398
MATT: Yeah, at the end of every 30 days 
she can repeat the saving throw.

3007
02:29:25,398 --> 02:29:27,222
(Cheers and yelling.)

3008
02:29:27,222 --> 02:29:31,387
TRAVIS: Oh my god, she fell, she fell off.

3009
02:29:31,387 --> 02:29:35,197
TALIESIN: Holy fuck. That looks painful.

3010
02:29:35,197 --> 02:29:36,546
LAURA: Are you okay?

3011
02:29:36,546 --> 02:29:39,216
LIAM: Marisha, what a beautiful moment! 
Get it, get it!

3012
02:29:39,216 --> 02:29:41,042
TALIESIN: We've still got problems.

3013
02:29:41,042 --> 02:29:42,474
MARISHA: We still have problems.

3014
02:29:42,474 --> 02:29:43,596
MATT: As you reach out,

3015
02:29:43,596 --> 02:29:47,474
you watch as the tendrils of nature's energy 
begin to spill out of the cracks in the vicinity.

3016
02:29:47,474 --> 02:29:53,025
MARISHA: And I just say, "Melora, come 
on, girl! Come on, Melora!"

3017
02:29:53,025 --> 02:30:01,211
MATT: You watch as Raishan chuckles. One of the 
tendrils lashes out and wraps around the throat.

3018
02:30:01,422 --> 02:30:03,700
And as they wrap and begin to strengthen 
around the neck,

3019
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:07,074
pouring into the cracks of the flesh where 
the disease currently holds her throat,

3020
02:30:07,074 --> 02:30:10,466
her brow begins to sink, the jaw hangs 
open,

3021
02:30:10,466 --> 02:30:14,251
and slobber begins to drip from her jaw 
as Raishan just, as opposed to speaking,

3022
02:30:14,251 --> 02:30:21,836
now does a guttural (heavy breaths and 
growling).

3023
02:30:21,836 --> 02:30:24,419
LIAM: Poetic justice, motherfucker!

3024
02:30:24,419 --> 02:30:26,449
TRAVIS: Still got a dragon. Still got a 
dragon.

3025
02:30:26,449 --> 02:30:31,975
MARISHA: She can still attack. 
"Grog! Grog, get her down!"

3026
02:30:31,975 --> 02:30:36,853
Is all I can scream before I just, my 
mind is blown.

3027
02:30:36,853 --> 02:30:38,929
MATT: Okay, so is that the end of 
your turn?

3028
02:30:38,929 --> 02:30:41,297
MARISHA: And then, panicking--

3029
02:30:41,297 --> 02:30:43,335
MATT: You still have a bonus action, 
right?

3030
02:30:43,335 --> 02:30:45,594
MARISHA: I do.

3031
02:30:45,594 --> 02:30:48,089
MATT: And technically ten more 
feet of movement.

3032
02:30:48,089 --> 02:30:53,030
MARISHA: Uh-huh. I'm going to go back 
towards Allura. Huh?

3033
02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:57,257
MATT: All these spells. Cannot use 
them now.

3034
02:30:57,257 --> 02:31:00,678
LIAM: That's right, Matt! That's right.

3035
02:31:00,678 --> 02:31:03,161
MARISHA: (yells) Okay. I'm going to go--

3036
02:31:03,161 --> 02:31:06,077
LAURA: That's karma for trying to kill 
Pike while she's not here.

3037
02:31:06,077 --> 02:31:08,700
MARISHA: Towards Allura, and heal the 
fuck out of myself.

3038
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:11,671
TRAVIS: You killed one of our gnomes!

3039
02:31:11,671 --> 02:31:14,689
MATT: I didn't, the dragon did.

3040
02:31:14,689 --> 02:31:17,173
MARISHA: I going to do a-- Jesus, 
I can't speak.

3041
02:31:17,173 --> 02:31:19,874
I'm going to do a third-level Cure Wounds 
on myself--

3042
02:31:19,874 --> 02:31:22,130
MATT: You can only do up to second level 
because you cast an eighth-level.

3043
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:23,881
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm going to do.

3044
02:31:23,881 --> 02:31:25,816
MATT: It's a Healing Word, bonus action.

3045
02:31:25,816 --> 02:31:28,743
MARISHA: Oh right, it's a bonus action. I'm 
sorry. I will do a second-level Healing Word.

3046
02:31:28,743 --> 02:31:30,236
MATT: All right. 2d4 plus six.

3047
02:31:30,236 --> 02:31:31,534
LIAM: Wow. Wow.

3048
02:31:31,534 --> 02:31:32,513
TRAVIS: Wow.

3049
02:31:32,513 --> 02:31:34,441
MATT: That brings us to the top. Vax, 
you're up.

3050
02:31:34,441 --> 02:31:35,625
LIAM: I'm just going to unload on her.

3051
02:31:35,625 --> 02:31:37,677
MATT: Except for, at the end of your turn, 
actually,

3052
02:31:37,677 --> 02:31:41,732
going to go ahead and use a legendary action 
to do a tail attack against you, Percy.

3053
02:31:41,732 --> 02:31:44,419
TALIESIN: Do I get a reaction against 
that?

3054
02:31:44,419 --> 02:31:45,933
MATT: A reaction?

3055
02:31:45,933 --> 02:31:48,372
TALIESIN: I can't react to her attack. Okay, she's 
just going to do a legendary attack against me.

3056
02:31:48,372 --> 02:31:48,922
MATT: Yeah.

3057
02:31:48,922 --> 02:31:50,240
TALIESIN: Okay.

3058
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:52,766
MATT: I mean. That is 23 to hit.

3059
02:31:52,766 --> 02:31:53,811
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

3060
02:31:53,811 --> 02:31:54,868
MATT: Okay.

3061
02:31:54,868 --> 02:31:57,354
MARISHA: Keyleth is at 28 hit points.

3062
02:31:57,354 --> 02:32:05,965
MATT: You take 21 points of bludgeoning damage. 
All right. Now, what are you doing, Vax?

3063
02:32:05,965 --> 02:32:08,385
LIAM: I'm unloading, dagger-dagger-dagger.

3064
02:32:08,385 --> 02:32:09,510
MATT: Go for it.

3065
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:11,557
LIAM: At advantage on all of it.
And can I do--

3066
02:32:11,557 --> 02:32:14,562
I've got two spells left, so can I do 
Smite and Smite?

3067
02:32:14,562 --> 02:32:17,804
Because it just says on melee attacks, it 
doesn't say how many a round or anything.

3068
02:32:17,804 --> 02:32:19,278
I don't know, I've never tried to do it.

3069
02:32:19,278 --> 02:32:21,083
MATT: No, on each attack you can do 
Smite, that's fine.

3070
02:32:21,083 --> 02:32:27,521
LIAM: All right, so. First attack is-- 
hits, it's 32. Second attack--

3071
02:32:27,521 --> 02:32:29,082
MATT: With a melee weapon attack.

3072
02:32:29,082 --> 02:32:30,948
LIAM: Oh, okay.

3073
02:32:30,948 --> 02:32:32,804
MATT: So you have to be up next to her.

3074
02:32:32,804 --> 02:32:34,979
LIAM: Well, let's just say I Whisper 
onto her neck.

3075
02:32:34,979 --> 02:32:37,099
MATT: Okay.

3076
02:32:37,099 --> 02:32:41,068
MARISHA: He's whispering sweet nothings.

3077
02:32:41,068 --> 02:32:42,357
TALIESIN: Into her neck?

3078
02:32:42,357 --> 02:32:43,316
MARISHA: Into her neck.

3079
02:32:43,316 --> 02:32:44,595
LAURA: Her feeble little mind.

3080
02:32:44,595 --> 02:32:45,881
MARISHA: Into her feeble mind.

3081
02:32:45,881 --> 02:32:47,222
TALIESIN: It's called a hickey.

3082
02:32:47,222 --> 02:32:53,931
LIAM: So that's the first attack, and I 
get Smite. Second attack is a 27.

3083
02:32:53,931 --> 02:32:55,474
MATT: That hits.

3084
02:32:55,474 --> 02:32:57,037
LIAM: I'm just going to do dagger-dagger, 
actually.

3085
02:32:57,037 --> 02:32:58,212
MATT: Okay.

3086
02:32:58,212 --> 02:32:59,798
LIAM: And the first attack--

3087
02:32:59,798 --> 02:33:01,802
MATT: Neither of these are sharpshooter 
because they're melee.

3088
02:33:01,802 --> 02:33:04,875
LIAM: That's all right. I didn't ask for that. 
So that's one plus eight is nine,

3089
02:33:04,875 --> 02:33:18,053
plus the psychic damage makes it 12, 
plus Smite is... 22, plus sneakies.

3090
02:33:19,270 --> 02:33:30,530
Yes, yes, yes. (counting) 53 is the first 
attack.

3091
02:33:30,530 --> 02:33:32,088
MATT: 53 points of damage.

3092
02:33:32,088 --> 02:33:33,438
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.

3093
02:33:33,438 --> 02:33:34,680
LAURA: Come on!

3094
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:44,554
LIAM: Second attack is also getting, okay, 
so one, just one, okay. Plus five and... eight.

3095
02:33:44,554 --> 02:33:50,716
All right. And I'm going to use my bonus action 
to disengage and just leap away from her

3096
02:33:50,716 --> 02:33:52,819
and just tumble-crash to the ground.

3097
02:33:52,819 --> 02:33:55,110
MATT: Okay.

3098
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:58,019
TALIESIN: Does she still have an attack 
of opportunity against disengagement,

3099
02:33:58,019 --> 02:33:59,565
or did that legendary action--

3100
02:33:59,565 --> 02:34:01,654
MATT: No, disengage doesn't have to. Make 
an acrobatics check, though.

3101
02:34:01,654 --> 02:34:03,207
LIAM: Okay.

3102
02:34:03,207 --> 02:34:06,647
TALIESIN: Well, I'm just curious because 
I'm going to have a problem in a moment.

3103
02:34:06,647 --> 02:34:07,858
LIAM: 25.

3104
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:11,034
MATT: 25, you land on both feet without 
an issue.

3105
02:34:11,034 --> 02:34:14,692
MARISHA: I got really excited and forgot 
to roll the damage that Feeblemind does.

3106
02:34:14,692 --> 02:34:17,149
Which is 4d6 psychic damage.

3107
02:34:17,149 --> 02:34:21,700
MATT: Oh. You did.

3108
02:34:21,700 --> 02:34:23,678
MARISHA: I just got real excited that it 
worked. I'm sorry.

3109
02:34:23,678 --> 02:34:25,960
TRAVIS: You fell off a bench!

3110
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:27,879
LAURA: You're going to have a big ol' 
bump on the back of your head.

3111
02:34:27,879 --> 02:34:29,368
MATT: Roll 4d6. Go for it.

3112
02:34:29,368 --> 02:34:32,934
MARISHA: Okay. It'll be fine. The 
adrenaline-- I don't feel it right now. 4d6.

3113
02:34:32,934 --> 02:34:34,118
MATT: 4d6.

3114
02:34:34,118 --> 02:34:37,910
LIAM: And I have 60 of movement, so leaping
off and rolling, does that use it all up,

3115
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:41,198
or can I move against the wall? Just keep 
going after I disengage from her?

3116
02:34:41,198 --> 02:34:42,984
MATT: You can move against the wall 
and get there.

3117
02:34:42,984 --> 02:34:47,020
LIAM: Thanks. Tuck and roll.

3118
02:34:47,020 --> 02:34:49,731
TALIESIN: Technically, wasn't she 
flanked, too?

3119
02:34:49,731 --> 02:34:50,635
LIAM: I already get advantage.

3120
02:34:50,635 --> 02:34:51,988
MARISHA: 13 points of psychic damage.

3121
02:34:51,988 --> 02:34:53,088
MATT: No, because you were-- how much?

3122
02:34:53,088 --> 02:34:53,749
MARISHA: 13.

3123
02:34:53,749 --> 02:34:54,933
MATT: 13? All right.

3124
02:34:54,933 --> 02:34:56,193
LIAM: I got the paladin eyes on her.

3125
02:34:56,193 --> 02:34:57,190
TALIESIN: Okay.

3126
02:34:57,190 --> 02:35:02,768
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn.

3127
02:35:02,768 --> 02:35:05,123
All right, at the end of her turn she's 
going to use

3128
02:35:05,123 --> 02:35:11,684
her last legendary action to attack 
Percy once more.

3129
02:35:11,684 --> 02:35:14,244
That is a 27 to hit.

3130
02:35:14,244 --> 02:35:15,787
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

3131
02:35:15,787 --> 02:35:17,707
MATT: All right.

3132
02:35:17,707 --> 02:35:19,396
MARISHA: She's just whaling on you.

3133
02:35:19,396 --> 02:35:21,714
TALIESIN: I'm the only thing within reach.

3134
02:35:21,714 --> 02:35:23,228
MATT: 23 points of bludgeoning damage.

3135
02:35:23,228 --> 02:35:24,184
TALIESIN: Okay.

3136
02:35:24,184 --> 02:35:25,133
MARISHA: You're doing okay.

3137
02:35:25,133 --> 02:35:26,039
LAURA: Jeez, how are you?

3138
02:35:26,039 --> 02:35:26,947
PATRICK: You're pretty good.

3139
02:35:26,947 --> 02:35:27,495
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

3140
02:35:27,495 --> 02:35:29,358
LAURA: Oh yeah, he was in the hundreds.

3141
02:35:29,358 --> 02:35:35,480
TALIESIN: 23 points... 61 right now. I'm 
at 61. Not wonderful but, you know.

3142
02:35:35,480 --> 02:35:39,049
LIAM: That is the most perfect, poetic 
moment.

3143
02:35:39,049 --> 02:35:40,476
MARISHA: It's like you and Thordak, man.

3144
02:35:40,476 --> 02:35:41,700
LIAM: Could not have been better.

3145
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:43,620
MATT: All right. Vex, you're up.

3146
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:47,264
LAURA: Okay. Using disengage, can you run 
past them with disengage?

3147
02:35:47,264 --> 02:35:48,468
MATT: Yeah, essentially disengage,

3148
02:35:48,468 --> 02:35:50,385
you go into combat and then you can 
leave combat

3149
02:35:50,385 --> 02:35:52,755
without getting an attack of opportunity 
on you.

3150
02:35:52,755 --> 02:35:55,055
LAURA: Okay, but I'm already in range 
of her.

3151
02:35:55,055 --> 02:35:58,073
MATT: You are just outside of her range, 
technically.

3152
02:35:58,073 --> 02:35:59,361
LAURA: Oh, really?

3153
02:35:59,361 --> 02:36:02,622
MATT: Yeah, her reach-- actually, with 
the tail? No, but she's up in the air.

3154
02:36:02,622 --> 02:36:04,711
I'll say you're just out of the range of 
the tail.

3155
02:36:04,711 --> 02:36:11,732
LAURA: Okay. How far away, if I ran past 
her, would I be able to get?

3156
02:36:11,732 --> 02:36:16,365
If I ran to the other side of her.

3157
02:36:16,365 --> 02:36:19,579
MATT: You can get just to the side 
of Kerrek.

3158
02:36:19,579 --> 02:36:22,440
LAURA: Okay, then I'm just going to 
back up.

3159
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:27,461
MATT: Okay, so half your movement there to 
get up from prone, so you can move fifteen more--

3160
02:36:27,461 --> 02:36:29,249
you've got three more squares you 
can move.

3161
02:36:29,249 --> 02:36:31,441
LAURA: I'm just going to back up into 
that-- dink dink dink--

3162
02:36:31,441 --> 02:36:32,181
MATT: To there?

3163
02:36:32,181 --> 02:36:33,746
LAURA: Yeah, and I'm going to shoot her.

3164
02:36:33,746 --> 02:36:36,464
MATT: Go for it.

3165
02:36:36,464 --> 02:36:37,876
LAURA: Yeah, I already used blazing 
bowstring.

3166
02:36:37,876 --> 02:36:39,703
MATT: That Feeblemind.

3167
02:36:39,703 --> 02:36:49,525
LAURA: Okay. 17.

3168
02:36:49,525 --> 02:36:55,622
MATT: 17 does not hit, no. Or the arrow hits and 
it just splinters across the outside of her body.

3169
02:36:55,622 --> 02:36:59,884
LAURA: Oh my god. I'm just doomed today. 
18.

3170
02:36:59,884 --> 02:37:03,426
MATT: 18. The second arrow does manage 
to strike the side of the shoulder,

3171
02:37:03,426 --> 02:37:10,544
and then the arrow actually breaks 
against the dragon's hide and scales.

3172
02:37:10,544 --> 02:37:14,506
That's going to end your turn. You still have a 
bonus action if you want to do something else.

3173
02:37:14,506 --> 02:37:18,564
LAURA: I'm going to use-- well, I didn't 
use disengage.

3174
02:37:18,564 --> 02:37:20,083
MATT: You didn't use disengage.

3175
02:37:20,083 --> 02:37:25,420
LAURA: Well, that's okay, I'll use my bonus 
action, fuck it, to do Grasping Vine.

3176
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:27,826
It's a bonus action.

3177
02:37:27,826 --> 02:37:31,036
MATT: All righty. From where and to where?

3178
02:37:31,036 --> 02:37:34,124
LAURA: From the ground. I'm going to grab 
Raishan and pull her to the ground.

3179
02:37:34,124 --> 02:37:37,750
MATT: Pull her down? Okay. All righty.

3180
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:42,327
So Grasping Vine, here, that's going to 
be a dexterity saving throw.

3181
02:37:42,395 --> 02:37:44,292
LAURA: Mm-hm.

3182
02:37:44,292 --> 02:37:49,477
MATT: That is a five plus nine, that is 14. 
What is your spell DC?

3183
02:37:49,477 --> 02:37:50,445
LAURA: 15!

3184
02:37:50,445 --> 02:37:53,019
(All cheer.)

3185
02:37:53,019 --> 02:37:54,560
MATT: All right. So.

3186
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,302
TALIESIN: Do I get an attack of 
opportunity on this one?

3187
02:37:56,302 --> 02:38:01,897
MATT: No, because it is forced down.
Raishan is pulled to the ground there.

3188
02:38:01,897 --> 02:38:05,297
MARISHA: Like a dog who just peed on 
the carpet.

3189
02:38:05,297 --> 02:38:06,642
MATT: All righty.

3190
02:38:06,642 --> 02:38:09,446
LAURA: I say, "You stay down, bitch!" 
And I'm going to go to the bathroom.

3191
02:38:09,446 --> 02:38:10,550
MARISHA: I am too.

3192
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:12,139
(all laugh)

3193
02:38:12,139 --> 02:38:13,854
MARISHA: I'm going to go too, while 
she's going.

3194
02:38:13,854 --> 02:38:15,187
LIAM: In character, in character.

3195
02:38:15,187 --> 02:38:17,382
TRAVIS: Leave the Mario way. 
(Mario sound effects)

3196
02:38:17,382 --> 02:38:18,169
MATT: All righty.

3197
02:38:18,169 --> 02:38:19,764
PATRICK: Just out of curiosity, I see 
there's--

3198
02:38:19,764 --> 02:38:21,805
from here, I can see there's plexiglass 
around there.

3199
02:38:21,805 --> 02:38:27,096
How close is that, like, the edge of her 
character to me?

3200
02:38:27,096 --> 02:38:30,659
MATT: Right now, she would be 
ten feet from you.

3201
02:38:30,659 --> 02:38:32,425
PATRICK: Okay.

3202
02:38:32,425 --> 02:38:35,546
MATT: All right. That brings us 
to Percy's turn.

3203
02:38:35,546 --> 02:38:37,250
TALIESIN: Weird question.

3204
02:38:37,250 --> 02:38:38,515
MATT: Yes.

3205
02:38:38,515 --> 02:38:44,725
TALIESIN: Am I still-- if I try to 
disengage right now, would I get attacked?

3206
02:38:44,725 --> 02:38:46,435
MATT: Yes. You are in melee.

3207
02:38:46,435 --> 02:38:50,683
TALIESIN: I'm in melee. Okay. That's fine.

3208
02:38:50,683 --> 02:38:53,086
I'm going to run around, I'm going 
to hit her with my sword.

3209
02:38:53,086 --> 02:38:57,967
I'm pulling-- putting the gun away, pulling 
out the sword, and just taking some shots.

3210
02:38:57,967 --> 02:38:59,779
TRAVIS: The Dragonslayer, right?

3211
02:38:59,779 --> 02:39:08,925
TALIESIN: Yep. Okay. Let's see. The first one 
definitely missed, which is a 19, did not hit.

3212
02:39:08,925 --> 02:39:14,318
MATT: 19 misses, unfortunately. 
(guttural growling)

3213
02:39:14,318 --> 02:39:15,825
TALIESIN: 22?

3214
02:39:15,825 --> 02:39:17,654
MATT: 22 just hits.

3215
02:39:17,654 --> 02:39:23,857
TALIESIN: Okay. 22 and the other one 
is a 28, so I got two shots.

3216
02:39:23,857 --> 02:39:25,805
MATT: Yes, so two ones hit.

3217
02:39:25,805 --> 02:39:31,860
TALIESIN: So let's do the first one, 
which is...

3218
02:39:38,048 --> 02:39:39,329
TRAVIS: You aristocratic bastard.

3219
02:39:39,329 --> 02:39:51,540
TALIESIN: 22 points of damage plus... 
10 points of lightning damage.

3220
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:54,013
MATT: All righty.

3221
02:39:54,013 --> 02:39:55,705
TRAVIS: Total of 32.

3222
02:39:55,705 --> 02:40:06,901
TALIESIN: Total of 32. And the second 
slash is... 21 points of damage.

3223
02:40:06,901 --> 02:40:14,064
MATT: Nice. Okay.

3224
02:40:14,064 --> 02:40:16,396
SAM: He was aiming at the eggs, though.

3225
02:40:16,396 --> 02:40:17,459
TALIESIN: The whole time.

3226
02:40:17,459 --> 02:40:20,061
MATT: The entire time. That's perfect.

3227
02:40:20,061 --> 02:40:27,312
TALIESIN: So I'm... I'm now going to 
disengage,

3228
02:40:27,312 --> 02:40:30,143
I'm going to let him take that shot and 
I'm going to run towards--

3229
02:40:30,143 --> 02:40:33,101
PATRICK: If you can pull her towards us?

3230
02:40:33,101 --> 02:40:35,488
TALIESIN: We'll see. I'm heading towards 
the eggs.

3231
02:40:35,488 --> 02:40:36,605
MATT: Okay.

3232
02:40:36,605 --> 02:40:38,045
TALIESIN: Full speed.

3233
02:40:38,045 --> 02:40:40,935
MATT: So as you go rushing, she's going 
to go ahead and make a claw swipe at you.

3234
02:40:40,935 --> 02:40:42,766
SAM: I died again.

3235
02:40:42,766 --> 02:40:43,709
MATT: That is--

3236
02:40:43,709 --> 02:40:44,921
PATRICK: (laughs) You died again.

3237
02:40:44,921 --> 02:40:46,094
MATT: That is a natural 20.

3238
02:40:46,094 --> 02:40:46,772
TALIESIN: Okay, that hits.

3239
02:40:46,772 --> 02:40:48,004
MATT: Sorry, buddy.

3240
02:40:48,004 --> 02:40:50,155
TALIESIN: That's okay. I regret nothing.

3241
02:40:50,155 --> 02:40:51,157
LIAM: No, no, no.

3242
02:40:51,157 --> 02:40:53,184
LAURA: No, stop it, stop it.

3243
02:40:53,184 --> 02:40:59,125
TALIESIN: Stop making noises, it's not 
polite. Stop counting.

3244
02:40:59,125 --> 02:41:01,166
MATT: 40 points of piercing damage.

3245
02:41:01,166 --> 02:41:02,083
TALIESIN: Okay.

3246
02:41:02,083 --> 02:41:04,158
MATT: As the claw strikes you from behind.

3247
02:41:04,158 --> 02:41:08,859
TRAVIS: So like, retaliated against it?

3248
02:41:08,859 --> 02:41:10,517
MATT: So. Where are you going now?

3249
02:41:10,517 --> 02:41:13,597
TALIESIN: I'm running six spaces towards 
the eggs and turning around

3250
02:41:13,597 --> 02:41:17,743
and pulling the gun back out and sitting on the 
wall like Spiderman, like an angry Spiderman.

3251
02:41:17,743 --> 02:41:22,261
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn, 
Percy?

3252
02:41:22,261 --> 02:41:24,935
TALIESIN: Anything I can do with my 
bonus action? No.

3253
02:41:24,935 --> 02:41:26,751
SAM: Drink something.

3254
02:41:26,751 --> 02:41:32,643
PATRICK: Before she goes-- because I'm 
not familiar with the hold action rules.

3255
02:41:32,643 --> 02:41:36,433
I was waiting around the corner for the 
dragon to show up.

3256
02:41:36,433 --> 02:41:38,759
MATT: Correct. It's not in range to you.

3257
02:41:38,759 --> 02:41:40,713
The moment the dragon comes into range, 
you can strike.

3258
02:41:40,713 --> 02:41:42,734
PATRICK: Okay, so that's the deciding 
factor--

3259
02:41:42,734 --> 02:41:44,000
MATT: Correct.

3260
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,597
PATRICK: -- even though she showed up, 
I can't finish my move that I delayed?

3261
02:41:46,597 --> 02:41:50,475
MATT: Unfortunately, with the fifth edition 
rules, they make it so it's like a quick reaction.

3262
02:41:50,475 --> 02:41:51,350
PATRICK: Okay.

3263
02:41:51,350 --> 02:41:59,333
MATT: However, the dragon does fly past 
to get around the edge to this side here.

3264
02:41:59,333 --> 02:42:03,009
LAURA: God, she's just going after Percy. 
She had a crush on you, man.

3265
02:42:03,009 --> 02:42:06,393
TALIESIN: I... no. She may vaguely 
remember that I was not cool.

3266
02:42:06,393 --> 02:42:08,379
TRAVIS: You tried to kill her, yeah.

3267
02:42:08,379 --> 02:42:10,188
LIAM: In this state, she's just going to 
mount you.

3268
02:42:10,188 --> 02:42:12,928
MATT: You do get to make your attack as 
she comes into range, flying past for you.

3269
02:42:12,928 --> 02:42:16,830
PATRICK: Oh, okay. That's all I need, 
just a chance.

3270
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:18,563
LAURA: My hand-dragon's on your shoulder.

3271
02:42:18,563 --> 02:42:20,728
LIAM: Not like this. Not like this.

3272
02:42:20,728 --> 02:42:22,422
LAURA: (laughing) Not like this.

3273
02:42:22,422 --> 02:42:25,356
SAM: Guys, now that I don't have to play, 
I'm playing Marvel Puzzle Quest.

3274
02:42:25,356 --> 02:42:28,532
(all laugh)

3275
02:42:28,532 --> 02:42:29,924
SAM: It's addictive!

3276
02:42:29,924 --> 02:42:32,017
LAURA: Like seriously, Sam has stacked 
up his binder,

3277
02:42:32,017 --> 02:42:33,800
he's closed everything like he's getting 
ready to go.

3278
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:35,088
MARISHA: This is sad. This is sad.

3279
02:42:35,088 --> 02:42:36,288
SAM: I can't do anything.

3280
02:42:36,288 --> 02:42:38,784
TALIESIN: No, this is the rest of the day 
for him, there's nowhere to go for-- yeah.

3281
02:42:38,784 --> 02:42:40,874
LIAM: Just put your head down on the 
desk, student.

3282
02:42:40,874 --> 02:42:43,864
TALIESIN: Think about what you've done.

3283
02:42:43,864 --> 02:42:44,867
MARISHA: Heads up, seven up.

3284
02:42:44,867 --> 02:42:46,588
LIAM: Heads up, seven up.

3285
02:42:46,588 --> 02:42:48,640
SAM: It was not your fault, Laura. 
It was Ashley's.

3286
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:50,971
PATRICK: 20, which is not going to make 
it, I'm guessing?

3287
02:42:50,971 --> 02:42:52,408
MATT: A total of twenty? No, 
unfortunately.

3288
02:42:52,408 --> 02:42:54,865
LAURA: (tearfully) I just rolled bad, 
I'm sorry.

3289
02:42:54,865 --> 02:43:01,575
PATRICK: Mother. Fucker. I miss with 
both. Got no juice to throw on it either.

3290
02:43:01,575 --> 02:43:04,123
MATT: First swing just goes wide, the 
second one hits the side,

3291
02:43:04,198 --> 02:43:08,675
but you haven't hit hard ancient dragon 
hide before, and it scrapes across the outside

3292
02:43:08,675 --> 02:43:14,151
with no noticeable damage and a little seed 
of fear wells in your heart once more.

3293
02:43:14,151 --> 02:43:18,271
PATRICK: Yep, that's okay. I got to use these 
actions that were going to be wasted anyway.

3294
02:43:18,271 --> 02:43:22,320
MATT: All right. As Raishan slams down 
onto the ground--

3295
02:43:22,320 --> 02:43:26,093
PATRICK: Was she holding action 
alongside me?

3296
02:43:26,093 --> 02:43:28,261
MATT: No, she cast a spell to heal you 
last turn as a bonus action.

3297
02:43:28,261 --> 02:43:29,224
PATRICK: Okay.

3298
02:43:29,224 --> 02:43:31,326
MATT: Raishan is going to unleash 
upon you, Percy,

3299
02:43:31,326 --> 02:43:34,259
who has avoided the Meteor Swarm, who 
has shot her in the face,

3300
02:43:34,259 --> 02:43:37,492
and right now in her feral state is just 
focused on what's closest and angry at her.

3301
02:43:37,492 --> 02:43:39,757
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah, all right.

3302
02:43:39,757 --> 02:43:42,283
MATT: First strike, that is a 26 to hit.

3303
02:43:42,283 --> 02:43:44,212
TALIESIN: Oh Jesus, how is this happening?

3304
02:43:44,212 --> 02:43:54,128
MATT: With the bite. That is 17 plus 
eight... 25 points of piercing damage.

3305
02:43:54,128 --> 02:43:55,512
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm out.

3306
02:43:55,512 --> 02:43:58,627
MARISHA: Oh no, oh no.

3307
02:43:58,627 --> 02:43:59,916
MATT: So you fall to the ground.

3308
02:43:59,916 --> 02:44:00,796
TALIESIN: Yep.

3309
02:44:00,796 --> 02:44:02,104
MARISHA: No no no no no.

3310
02:44:02,104 --> 02:44:03,605
TRAVIS: Here we go. (clears throat) Jenga?

3311
02:44:03,605 --> 02:44:04,997
MATT: So you lose a death save.

3312
02:44:04,997 --> 02:44:06,663
TALIESIN: I know. Oh, is that lose a 
death save?

3313
02:44:06,663 --> 02:44:09,826
I was only a few feet up, it wasn't like 
a-- it wasn't-- okay. All right.

3314
02:44:09,826 --> 02:44:11,504
MATT: You were just a few feet up? 
As opposed to?

3315
02:44:11,504 --> 02:44:14,739
TALIESIN: I mean, I was-- yeah.

3316
02:44:14,739 --> 02:44:16,674
LIAM: I mean, an eight-foot drop on 
your head is pretty bad.

3317
02:44:16,674 --> 02:44:18,771
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's pretty bad. 
I'm taking it.

3318
02:44:18,771 --> 02:44:21,089
PATRICK: You could leave him with one 
foot stuck to the wall.

3319
02:44:21,089 --> 02:44:22,865
TALIESIN: Ow. Ow.

3320
02:44:22,865 --> 02:44:25,602
(all laugh)

3321
02:44:25,602 --> 02:44:27,343
TALIESIN: Like a punching bag.

3322
02:44:27,343 --> 02:44:29,572
SAM: It's going to be Shorthalt and de 
Rolo in heaven, just--

3323
02:44:29,572 --> 02:44:33,772
TALIESIN: Oh, it's so cute that you think 
either of us are going to heaven.

3324
02:44:33,772 --> 02:44:37,700
MATT: Going to angrily take a claw attack 
at your body, which hits,

3325
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:39,514
a critical, that's two death saving 
throws--

3326
02:44:39,514 --> 02:44:41,154
PATRICK: A critical?

3327
02:44:41,154 --> 02:44:41,782
MATT: Percy, you're dead.

3328
02:44:41,782 --> 02:44:43,218
TALIESIN: I'm out.

3329
02:44:43,218 --> 02:44:46,991
MATT: As the bite knocks you to the ground, 
the claw slams down onto your torso,

3330
02:44:46,991 --> 02:44:50,333
and just tears out the side of your body, your 
entrails scattered across the stone floor--

3331
02:44:50,333 --> 02:44:53,083
SAM: You're up, Laura. Roll good.

3332
02:44:53,083 --> 02:44:56,172
MATT: -- and your breath just escapes out.

3333
02:44:56,172 --> 02:44:58,734
Kerrek, you and Kima both there watch 
this happen

3334
02:44:58,734 --> 02:45:04,855
as Percy is now partially spread across 
the stone immediately to the right of you.

3335
02:45:04,855 --> 02:45:07,165
TALIESIN: The blood is in fact blue.

3336
02:45:07,165 --> 02:45:09,382
MATT: And Raishan gets her legendary 
actions back.

3337
02:45:09,382 --> 02:45:12,514
That's going to end Raishan's turn. 
Grog, you're up.

3338
02:45:12,514 --> 02:45:15,590
TRAVIS: Yeah! Grog would like to get up.

3339
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:17,087
LIAM: Stand up.

3340
02:45:17,087 --> 02:45:18,617
TRAVIS: What does that take for me 
to do that?

3341
02:45:18,617 --> 02:45:20,991
MATT: That's half your movement. 25.

3342
02:45:20,991 --> 02:45:25,202
TRAVIS: Half my movement. Can I use the rest 
of my movement to run towards dragon-dick?

3343
02:45:25,202 --> 02:45:26,363
MARISHA: Towards dragon-dick?

3344
02:45:26,363 --> 02:45:26,943
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3345
02:45:26,943 --> 02:45:28,542
MATT: 25. That's as far as you can get.

3346
02:45:28,542 --> 02:45:30,853
TRAVIS: Can I use the boots of feral 
leaping to leap even further.

3347
02:45:30,853 --> 02:45:31,999
MATT: Make your athletics check.

3348
02:45:31,999 --> 02:45:32,643
TRAVIS: Okay.

3349
02:45:32,643 --> 02:45:35,489
LAURA: Wait a minute, did she even roll 
to break her Grasping Vine?

3350
02:45:35,489 --> 02:45:38,697
MATT: Grasping Vine doesn't keep her restrained, 
it just grabs somebody and pulls them there,

3351
02:45:38,697 --> 02:45:40,078
it's meant to move things--

3352
02:45:40,078 --> 02:45:41,001
TRAVIS: Natural 20 on that one.

3353
02:45:41,001 --> 02:45:41,924
MARISHA: Natural 20?

3354
02:45:41,924 --> 02:45:43,020
TRAVIS: Yeah, on my leaping.

3355
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:44,208
(all laugh)

3356
02:45:44,208 --> 02:45:45,555
MARISHA: Well, I mean, that's still cool.

3357
02:45:45,555 --> 02:45:51,247
TRAVIS: I leap through her chest. Boom!

3358
02:45:51,247 --> 02:45:52,573
LIAM: Pacman through it?

3359
02:45:52,573 --> 02:45:56,205
TRAVIS: Yeah. So I have my three attacks, yes?

3360
02:45:56,205 --> 02:45:58,548
MATT: Yes. You're not in melee, you 
didn't quite get far enough to get--

3361
02:45:58,548 --> 02:46:06,498
TRAVIS: Imma have to throw 'em. Reckless, 
not negated because I can see her now.

3362
02:46:06,498 --> 02:46:07,849
MATT: Correct.

3363
02:46:07,849 --> 02:46:14,772
TRAVIS: Right. 30.

3364
02:46:14,772 --> 02:46:16,066
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

3365
02:46:16,066 --> 02:46:25,535
TRAVIS: Okay. 23 for the first one.

3366
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:30,625
MATT: 23 damage? All righty.

3367
02:46:30,625 --> 02:46:35,267
TRAVIS: The second one I'll make 
reckless and great weapon master.

3368
02:46:35,267 --> 02:46:36,582
MATT: Sure.

3369
02:46:36,582 --> 02:46:38,494
TRAVIS: Okay. No, I can't do great weapon 
master because it's one-handed.

3370
02:46:38,494 --> 02:46:41,393
MATT: Yeah, no, well, it's thrown, you 
can only do it with melee.

3371
02:46:41,393 --> 02:46:50,782
TRAVIS: Right. Jesus. 24.

3372
02:46:50,782 --> 02:46:58,128
MATT: 24 hits.

3373
02:46:58,128 --> 02:47:02,737
TRAVIS: 23 for the second one.

3374
02:47:02,737 --> 02:47:05,503
MATT: Okay.

3375
02:47:05,503 --> 02:47:08,065
TRAVIS: Piece of shit for the third one. 
Wait, where's--

3376
02:47:08,065 --> 02:47:09,262
MATT: 23, you said?

3377
02:47:09,262 --> 02:47:10,135
TRAVIS: 23.

3378
02:47:10,135 --> 02:47:12,308
LAURA: Does Kima have Revivify, do 
you think?

3379
02:47:12,308 --> 02:47:13,767
SAM: Don't you have two of them?

3380
02:47:13,767 --> 02:47:14,678
TRAVIS: Third attack.

3381
02:47:14,678 --> 02:47:17,535
MARISHA: Maybe, she might. Are you 
guys out of Revivifies?

3382
02:47:17,535 --> 02:47:19,930
LAURA: No, Pike has lots more spells.

3383
02:47:19,930 --> 02:47:21,559
TALIESIN: We've got time.

3384
02:47:21,559 --> 02:47:22,078
TRAVIS: 27.

3385
02:47:22,078 --> 02:47:23,941
MATT: 27 hits.

3386
02:47:23,941 --> 02:47:24,874
TALIESIN: In a minute. That's a long time.

3387
02:47:25,222 --> 02:47:26,935
PATRICK: A minute's a long time.

3388
02:47:26,935 --> 02:47:28,449
TALIESIN: Ten rounds.

3389
02:47:28,449 --> 02:47:30,253
LAURA: She's got little legs.

3390
02:47:30,253 --> 02:47:33,322
MARISHA: Matt gets weird about the 
minute rule. Just keep that in mind.

3391
02:47:33,322 --> 02:47:34,990
I think the sooner you do it, the easier.

3392
02:47:34,990 --> 02:47:35,879
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

3393
02:47:35,879 --> 02:47:37,052
TRAVIS: 26 for the third one.

3394
02:47:37,052 --> 02:47:39,651
TALIESIN: Matt does get weird about the 
minute rule, that is also funny.

3395
02:47:39,651 --> 02:47:44,327
SAM: Right now, Scanlan's getting fed grapes 
by little cherubs that are the same size as him.

3396
02:47:44,327 --> 02:47:46,186
(all laugh)

3397
02:47:46,186 --> 02:47:52,246
SAM: And he's like, come on, Percy, we've 
got red and green grapes.

3398
02:47:52,246 --> 02:47:53,707
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, 
Grog?

3399
02:47:53,707 --> 02:47:54,922
LAURA: Like, the ultimate punishment for 
Scanlan is he would show up

3400
02:47:54,922 --> 02:47:56,568
as a spectral servant in somebody else's 
mansion?

3401
02:47:56,568 --> 02:47:57,701
SAM: Oh god!

3402
02:47:57,701 --> 02:48:00,457
TRAVIS: No, the last one I rolled a one 
on the damage,

3403
02:48:00,457 --> 02:48:02,601
I reroll ones or twos with that first 
thing of fighter?

3404
02:48:02,601 --> 02:48:06,158
SAM: You want what? Oh. All right.

3405
02:48:06,158 --> 02:48:09,900
MATT: That's for the larger weapon. 
I'll double-check real fast.

3406
02:48:09,900 --> 02:48:12,238
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't remember what 
the number was, anyway.

3407
02:48:12,238 --> 02:48:17,502
MATT: Well, here, just to remind myself.

3408
02:48:17,502 --> 02:48:21,838
The weapon... a melee weapon you're 
wielding with two hands,

3409
02:48:21,838 --> 02:48:23,204
which as you're throwing it, you're not.

3410
02:48:23,204 --> 02:48:24,257
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3411
02:48:24,257 --> 02:48:28,962
MATT: So no. All right, got it. That ends 
Grog's turn. Kerrek, you're up.

3412
02:48:28,962 --> 02:48:31,691
PATRICK: Oh please, please just let me,

3413
02:48:31,691 --> 02:48:37,175
all I want to do is stick at least one on 
this god damned dragon.

3414
02:48:37,175 --> 02:48:42,257
MARISHA: Come on, Kerr-bear!

3415
02:48:42,257 --> 02:48:43,449
LIAM: Yes!

3416
02:48:43,449 --> 02:48:46,345
PATRICK: Okay. So there is 26.

3417
02:48:46,345 --> 02:48:47,294
MATT: 26 hits.

3418
02:48:47,294 --> 02:48:48,857
LAURA: Yeah!

3419
02:48:48,857 --> 02:48:55,151
PATRICK: And a 20. I'm guessing the 20--

3420
02:48:55,151 --> 02:48:56,747
MATT: 20 misses, unfortunately.

3421
02:48:56,747 --> 02:49:00,520
PATRICK: Unless this dragon is so surprised 
that I finally made a successful attack.

3422
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:02,712
(all laugh)

3423
02:49:02,712 --> 02:49:04,222
MATT: No, unfortunately,

3424
02:49:04,222 --> 02:49:10,328
the feral angry unintelligible state of 
Raishan right now as just a beast, no.

3425
02:49:10,328 --> 02:49:13,470
Not surprised. Instinct now.

3426
02:49:13,470 --> 02:49:19,134
PATRICK: So I'm going to burn my 
second-level spell for Smite

3427
02:49:19,134 --> 02:49:27,166
and she is not anything that is 
specifically affected by Doomhammer here?

3428
02:49:27,166 --> 02:49:28,707
She's not undead technically or--

3429
02:49:28,707 --> 02:49:29,913
MATT: No.

3430
02:49:29,913 --> 02:49:31,032
PATRICK: Just regular old evil?

3431
02:49:31,032 --> 02:49:32,132
MATT: Yeah.

3432
02:49:32,132 --> 02:49:32,850
PATRICK: Okay.

3433
02:49:32,850 --> 02:49:33,703
MARISHA: Regular old evil.

3434
02:49:33,703 --> 02:49:34,663
TALIESIN: She's just awful.

3435
02:49:34,663 --> 02:49:35,926
MARISHA: Classic evil.

3436
02:49:35,926 --> 02:49:53,458
PATRICK: Just... just bad. So that's 
ten... 18... one more. 28.

3437
02:49:53,458 --> 02:49:54,832
MATT: 28 points of damage?

3438
02:49:54,832 --> 02:49:56,627
PATRICK: 28.

3439
02:49:56,627 --> 02:49:59,118
TRAVIS: She dies suddenly. 
A cardiac arrest.

3440
02:49:59,118 --> 02:50:02,053
MATT: At a max hit points of 520... 
How do you want to do this?

3441
02:50:02,053 --> 02:50:05,897
(Screaming and cheering.)

3442
02:50:05,897 --> 02:50:13,172
MATT: Literally had seven hit points 
left. As far as my math goes, yeah.

3443
02:50:13,172 --> 02:50:15,636
LIAM: Level seven!

3444
02:50:15,636 --> 02:50:18,982
MATT: I can't fucking believe-- I can't 
fucking believe that happened!

3445
02:50:18,982 --> 02:50:22,615
LAURA: Kerrek just like leveled up 
to like...

3446
02:50:22,615 --> 02:50:24,262
MATT: So. How do you want to do this?

3447
02:50:24,262 --> 02:50:25,378
LAURA: Oh my god.

3448
02:50:25,378 --> 02:50:26,359
MARISHA: Oh my god, Kerrek!

3449
02:50:26,359 --> 02:50:28,721
MATT: The feral beast there, tearing 
the innards out of Percy on the ground,

3450
02:50:28,721 --> 02:50:31,589
Grog slamming into it, just seemingly 
bashing against the world,

3451
02:50:31,589 --> 02:50:36,009
watching everyone drop around you 
like flies, your warhammer in hand.

3452
02:50:36,009 --> 02:50:46,173
PATRICK: What I would like to do is step over to 
be over his body, and it's like, no, no further.

3453
02:50:46,173 --> 02:50:58,119
And as the dragon is coming in, just trying to 
mindlessly claw at this poor destroyed corpse...

3454
02:50:58,119 --> 02:51:02,268
I like to think of the anime slow-mo 
strike,

3455
02:51:02,268 --> 02:51:05,070
where the hammer comes back and 
it slows down

3456
02:51:05,070 --> 02:51:07,571
and then when it connects you get 
the big starburst.

3457
02:51:07,571 --> 02:51:12,900
Wow, okay.

3458
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:19,176
MATT: As the hammer arcs downward 
(slow-mo sound effects).

3459
02:51:19,176 --> 02:51:22,699
It just slams into the snout of Raishan 
just as the head turns up,

3460
02:51:22,699 --> 02:51:24,758
the eyes that were once reptilian and 
intelligent

3461
02:51:24,758 --> 02:51:29,408
are now just filled with bloodshot rage 
and feral intensity.

3462
02:51:29,408 --> 02:51:33,787
The jaw is attempting to snap up and 
catch the blade, however, you're too fast.

3463
02:51:33,787 --> 02:51:35,990
Your old adventuring reflexes are kicking 
in.

3464
02:51:35,990 --> 02:51:40,979
As the glowing hammerhead comes down onto 
the snout, the divine energy blasts forward,

3465
02:51:40,979 --> 02:51:46,940
and you watch as the dragon's face 
explodes, inverting inward,

3466
02:51:46,940 --> 02:51:50,706
the front of the skull being blown backward, 
and you guys watch as this flash of light

3467
02:51:50,706 --> 02:51:57,712
fills the entirety of this necrotic space. 
This one plume of radiant smoke kind of pssssh.

3468
02:51:57,712 --> 02:52:01,887
And left behind, you see Kerrek standing 
there, holding the rod,

3469
02:52:01,887 --> 02:52:06,833
the actual head of the hammer now dismissed 
as part of the burst of radiant energy,

3470
02:52:06,833 --> 02:52:12,318
and there the smoking ruin of the throat, 
headless, of Raishan the Diseased Deceiver,

3471
02:52:12,318 --> 02:52:18,338
collapsing to the ground, unmoving.

3472
02:52:18,338 --> 02:52:21,391
And we're going to take a quick break. 
Take a break,

3473
02:52:21,391 --> 02:52:25,540
and we're going to take a little time to 
take in the aftermath of this moment

3474
02:52:25,540 --> 02:52:28,787
before we finish tonight's episode. So 
we'll be back here in a few minutes,

3475
02:52:28,787 --> 02:52:30,896
we're going to go ahead and use the 
restroom. We'll see you guys here shortly.

3476
02:52:30,896 --> 02:52:31,790
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

3477
02:52:31,790 --> 02:52:34,702
MARISHA: Holy shit!

3478
02:52:34,702 --> 03:06:24,626
[BREAK]

3479
03:06:24,626 --> 03:06:26,872
MATT: And welcome back. So.

3480
03:06:26,872 --> 03:06:33,692
Last we left off, the battle with Raishan 
ended with a victory for Vox Machina

3481
03:06:33,692 --> 03:06:38,997
but at a rather high cost at the moment. 
As you stand now in the still silence,

3482
03:06:38,997 --> 03:06:47,291
the aftermath of the fray, looking down, 
seeing your allies beaten, bruised, disheveled,

3483
03:06:47,291 --> 03:06:50,882
Scanlan lifeless on the ground on one 
side of this cavern,

3484
03:06:50,882 --> 03:06:56,946
and a partially gutted Percy lifeless on 
the other,

3485
03:06:56,946 --> 03:07:02,733
the smoldering ruin that was once the head 
of Raishan lifeless and still on the ground

3486
03:07:02,733 --> 03:07:07,187
as Kerrek clutches the hammer. 
Kima walks over

3487
03:07:07,187 --> 03:07:11,438
and grabs your shoulder and tightly 
squeezes it, going,

3488
03:07:11,438 --> 03:07:22,450
"You did what had to be done. Thank you."

3489
03:07:22,450 --> 03:07:29,353
PATRICK: I mean, I've been around, 
I can't help him, can I?

3490
03:07:29,353 --> 03:07:38,445
MATT: "I think he's beyond either of our power 
now. Allie? Please tell me she's alive."

3491
03:07:38,445 --> 03:07:45,396
And Kima runs off, realizing that she doesn't 
really know the status of the rest of the group.

3492
03:07:45,396 --> 03:07:47,476
Allura shouts out to her on the side.

3493
03:07:47,476 --> 03:07:48,514
LAURA: What's happening?

3494
03:07:48,514 --> 03:07:50,524
MATT: I'm all right!

3495
03:07:50,524 --> 03:07:55,441
PATRICK: I get down there, and I'm doing, 
I'm doing useless combat triage.

3496
03:07:55,441 --> 03:07:56,809
MATT: Trying to gather what you--

3497
03:07:56,809 --> 03:07:58,542
PATRICK: You do what you can.

3498
03:07:58,542 --> 03:08:00,384
MATT: What's outside, putting it back in. 
Yeah.

3499
03:08:00,384 --> 03:08:02,573
PATRICK: And I've-- yeah.

3500
03:08:02,573 --> 03:08:04,085
LAURA: Vax?

3501
03:08:04,085 --> 03:08:05,202
LIAM: Yeah.

3502
03:08:05,202 --> 03:08:05,942
LAURA: Are you up?

3503
03:08:05,942 --> 03:08:07,423
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah.

3504
03:08:07,423 --> 03:08:10,938
LAURA: Good. Percival? How are you?

3505
03:08:10,938 --> 03:08:12,910
MARISHA: Sound off if you're alive.

3506
03:08:12,910 --> 03:08:14,178
TRAVIS: Alive.

3507
03:08:14,178 --> 03:08:15,989
LIAM: I start stumbling over towards
Scanlan.

3508
03:08:15,989 --> 03:08:17,433
MARISHA: Percy.

3509
03:08:17,433 --> 03:08:20,528
LAURA: "Percy?" I go running around 
the corner.

3510
03:08:20,528 --> 03:08:21,916
MARISHA: Same.

3511
03:08:21,916 --> 03:08:25,786
MATT: As you guys both kind of run, 
Keyleth a bit behind,

3512
03:08:25,786 --> 03:08:29,835
Vex, you turn and you see Raishan's 
corpse just piled,

3513
03:08:29,835 --> 03:08:34,483
and then on the ground you see Kerrek 
slowly and methodically,

3514
03:08:34,483 --> 03:08:38,400
almost staring off into a memory,

3515
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:45,111
trying to gather a bit of Percival's 
scattered innards from the side torn open.

3516
03:08:45,111 --> 03:08:54,260
LAURA: "No. No!" And I run over to him. 
"Help him! Pike!"

3517
03:08:54,260 --> 03:08:58,579
MATT: Pike comes running around the 
corner. "Oh, God."

3518
03:08:58,579 --> 03:09:04,859
And she runs up real fast and begins 
gathering her Revivify spell.

3519
03:09:04,859 --> 03:09:07,985
TRAVIS: Wh-where's Scanlan?

3520
03:09:07,985 --> 03:09:12,543
LIAM: I pick him up. I start walking 
towards Grog with him.

3521
03:09:12,543 --> 03:09:15,380
MATT: Did either of you guys want to 
roll for Pike's Revivify?

3522
03:09:15,380 --> 03:09:18,591
LIAM: On Percy?

3523
03:09:18,591 --> 03:09:19,993
LAURA: On Percy.

3524
03:09:19,993 --> 03:09:21,127
MATT: Percival, yeah.

3525
03:09:21,127 --> 03:09:22,701
TRAVIS: Do you want Matt to do this, so 
that there's no--

3526
03:09:22,701 --> 03:09:23,387
LAURA: I--

3527
03:09:23,387 --> 03:09:25,818
LIAM: I'll do it. I don't want you to have-- 
I don't want you to--

3528
03:09:25,818 --> 03:09:35,897
get out of your head, I'll do it, I'll do it. 
I'll do it. It's just dice. It's the universe.

3529
03:09:35,897 --> 03:09:37,715
That's low.

3530
03:09:37,715 --> 03:09:39,573
LAURA: Oh, no. Is that a five?

3531
03:09:39,573 --> 03:09:40,783
LIAM: Plus six.

3532
03:09:40,783 --> 03:09:44,917
LAURA: Plus what? It's not going to work.

3533
03:09:44,917 --> 03:09:46,409
MATT: Six plus five?

3534
03:09:46,409 --> 03:09:47,477
LAURA: Eleven.

3535
03:09:47,477 --> 03:09:52,417
MATT: Percival has died... how many times?

3536
03:09:52,417 --> 03:09:53,588
LAURA: I don't know.

3537
03:09:53,588 --> 03:09:54,931
MARISHA: Once.

3538
03:09:54,931 --> 03:09:57,078
MATT: I think just once for him, right?

3539
03:09:57,078 --> 03:09:58,591
LIAM: The big one.

3540
03:09:58,591 --> 03:10:01,434
MARISHA: It works. It works. It's just 
enough. It's just enough.

3541
03:10:01,434 --> 03:10:02,662
TRAVIS: Wait, how many times has he died?

3542
03:10:02,662 --> 03:10:03,893
MATT: We're double-checking. Taliesin.

3543
03:10:03,893 --> 03:10:05,166
TRAVIS: Taliesin, how many times 
have you died?

3544
03:10:05,166 --> 03:10:06,889
TALIESIN: Does the necklace count, or does
the necklace not count?

3545
03:10:06,889 --> 03:10:07,873
MATT: The necklace does not count.

3546
03:10:07,873 --> 03:10:11,561
TALIESIN: Once. As far as I can remember.

3547
03:10:11,561 --> 03:10:14,552
LAURA: 'Cause the necklace just instantly 
bamfed him back.

3548
03:10:14,552 --> 03:10:16,543
MATT: Yeah, similar to the effect earlier.

3549
03:10:16,543 --> 03:10:17,739
LIAM: Yeah, it's a shield.

3550
03:10:17,739 --> 03:10:19,164
MARISHA: Oh, come on, come on.

3551
03:10:19,164 --> 03:10:22,332
PATRICK: If that's going on, I've got like 
30 points of Lay on Hands

3552
03:10:22,332 --> 03:10:29,228
just that I have not had a chance to use, 
and I'm probably not in great shape.

3553
03:10:29,228 --> 03:10:33,296
I'm probably going to be trying to use 
it even though I know better.

3554
03:10:33,296 --> 03:10:38,900
MATT: So as you're trying to grab the body 
and trying to make it form, it's not--

3555
03:10:38,900 --> 03:10:44,281
it's not doing anything and the healing magic is 
not taking effect into the now-still cold body.

3556
03:10:44,281 --> 03:10:48,305
As Pike's metallic hand comes into your 
visual frame, Kerrek,

3557
03:10:48,305 --> 03:10:53,377
you watch in that slow breathless motion 
as her gauntleted arm reaches down

3558
03:10:53,377 --> 03:10:57,882
and touches the clavicle of the bloody 
mess of Percy's torso.

3559
03:10:57,882 --> 03:11:02,470
And as the divine energy pulses warmth 
once more through the chest,

3560
03:11:02,470 --> 03:11:15,108
you watch as the bits of exposed organ 
that you had pushed in close over with skin.

3561
03:11:15,108 --> 03:11:24,892
(breathes) And breath comes back to Percival's 
body. You come to consciousness. Barely.

3562
03:11:24,892 --> 03:11:26,030
TALIESIN: Quick question.

3563
03:11:26,030 --> 03:11:26,876
MATT: Yes.

3564
03:11:34,926 --> 03:11:37,343
TALIESIN: Okay, just checking. Okay. 
Good to know.

3565
03:11:38,095 --> 03:11:49,669
LAURA: I just kiss-kiss-kiss-kiss, 
tears-tears-tears-tears.

3566
03:11:49,669 --> 03:11:51,328
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice.

3567
03:11:51,328 --> 03:11:55,029
LAURA: Welcome back. Don't look down, 
you're a bloody mess.

3568
03:11:55,029 --> 03:11:59,884
TALIESIN: (panicked laughter) Oh. Is this 
mine?

3569
03:11:59,884 --> 03:12:01,105
MARISHA: No?

3570
03:12:01,105 --> 03:12:04,490
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to pass out.

3571
03:12:04,490 --> 03:12:05,902
TRAVIS: Are we all here, then?

3572
03:12:05,902 --> 03:12:07,495
LIAM: Grog!

3573
03:12:07,495 --> 03:12:08,946
LAURA: Scanlan was down.

3574
03:12:08,946 --> 03:12:10,227
MARISHA: Scanlan's down.

3575
03:12:10,227 --> 03:12:12,240
TRAVIS: I take off running for Vax.

3576
03:12:12,240 --> 03:12:13,800
MATT: Okay. As you turn around the 
corner--

3577
03:12:13,800 --> 03:12:15,758
LIAM: I've got him in my arms.

3578
03:12:15,758 --> 03:12:21,835
MATT: Kima and Allura are rushing up 
to you now as well. "Is he--"

3579
03:12:21,835 --> 03:12:27,400
And you turn the corner, Grog, and you 
see Vax holding the still body of Scanlan,

3580
03:12:27,400 --> 03:12:30,479
just dangling out of his arms.

3581
03:12:30,479 --> 03:12:42,494
TRAVIS: No. No. No! Fix him! FIX HIM!

3582
03:12:42,494 --> 03:12:46,853
LIAM: I just start to rock him like 
a child.

3583
03:12:46,853 --> 03:12:48,896
TRAVIS: Well, somebody do something.

3584
03:12:48,896 --> 03:12:50,207
TALIESIN: We have to take him home.

3585
03:12:50,207 --> 03:12:52,338
MARISHA: We have to get him out of here.

3586
03:12:52,338 --> 03:12:55,117
TRAVIS: Well, we got all these people 
with magic, you've all got magic spells,

3587
03:12:55,117 --> 03:12:56,866
you just brought him back. Fix him!

3588
03:12:56,866 --> 03:12:59,361
LAURA: Pike looks at Kima. "Can you do 
anything?"

3589
03:12:59,361 --> 03:13:03,261
MATT: This is-- this is beyond any of my 
capabilities.

3590
03:13:03,261 --> 03:13:09,363
I-- look, I have a certain skillset, and 
it's not this kind of skillset, I'm sorry.

3591
03:13:09,363 --> 03:13:19,854
MARISHA: Vax, the Raven Queen. You 
can talk to her, right? Vax?

3592
03:13:19,854 --> 03:13:22,454
TRAVIS: I mean, what do we need? Do 
we need, like--

3593
03:13:22,454 --> 03:13:27,083
MARISHA: Okay. We have to get him out of 
here, because this place sucks.

3594
03:13:27,083 --> 03:13:35,075
TALIESIN: We need to take him somewhere. To 
the temple. And we need to find his daughter.

3595
03:13:35,075 --> 03:13:45,119
MARISHA: Um, okay. Question. Oh, you 
didn't kill anything, did you, Vex?

3596
03:13:45,119 --> 03:13:47,288
There's no, like Fenthras-trees?

3597
03:13:47,288 --> 03:13:48,102
LAURA: No.

3598
03:13:48,102 --> 03:13:48,901
MARISHA: There's no trees?

3599
03:13:48,901 --> 03:13:50,094
MATT: No trees.

3600
03:13:50,094 --> 03:13:51,365
LAURA: Can Allura do--

3601
03:13:51,365 --> 03:14:03,024
MATT: Allura says, "I do have a teleport 
spell I can utilize. Gather everyone around."

3602
03:14:03,024 --> 03:14:11,886
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop the gate 
stone that we have right in this room.

3603
03:14:11,886 --> 03:14:16,210
I'm just going to leave it here.

3604
03:14:16,210 --> 03:14:19,613
LIAM: You know, you're very funny, but 
this is not very funny.

3605
03:14:19,613 --> 03:14:25,346
TALIESIN: I'm coming back here to dissect 
that monster once we're done.

3606
03:14:25,346 --> 03:14:30,742
MARISHA: That's fair. Okay, let's save 
our friend.

3607
03:14:30,742 --> 03:14:36,415
MATT: "All right. Let's all of us gather 
our hands together."

3608
03:14:36,415 --> 03:14:39,675
She puts her hands out, Kima takes one 
side, and you all form a circle.

3609
03:14:39,675 --> 03:14:42,606
TALIESIN: I am lying down to do this, but 
yes.

3610
03:14:42,606 --> 03:14:50,484
MATT: She closes her eyes. She begins 
the incantation under her breath.

3611
03:14:50,484 --> 03:14:51,591
TRAVIS: Why did he roll?

3612
03:14:51,591 --> 03:14:53,496
LAURA: Why is she rolling?

3613
03:14:53,496 --> 03:14:58,453
MATT: There's a brief flux of arcane energy, 
and then it fades and you all remain in place.

3614
03:14:58,453 --> 03:14:59,087
TRAVIS: Fuck.

3615
03:14:59,087 --> 03:15:00,028
MARISHA: No.

3616
03:15:00,028 --> 03:15:07,612
MATT: She goes, "Um."

3617
03:15:07,612 --> 03:15:08,851
MARISHA: What's wrong?

3618
03:15:08,851 --> 03:15:13,113
MATT: I don't know, something is-- 
something is barring my--

3619
03:15:13,113 --> 03:15:16,955
PATRICK: It's this place. The dragon said 
that there were features to this place.

3620
03:15:16,955 --> 03:15:19,209
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. We don't have--

3621
03:15:19,209 --> 03:15:26,439
PATRICK: Kerrek has no affect in his 
voice.

3622
03:15:26,439 --> 03:15:27,500
TRAVIS: We have to get out of here.

3623
03:15:27,500 --> 03:15:31,522
PATRICK: Up and out.

3624
03:15:31,522 --> 03:15:35,721
MARISHA: Up and out. Up and out?

3625
03:15:35,721 --> 03:15:41,484
LAURA: Pike's going to cast Detect Magic 
and see where it's coming from.

3626
03:15:41,484 --> 03:15:43,075
Can she see if it's coming from anywhere?

3627
03:15:43,075 --> 03:15:47,223
MATT: Okay, she casts Detect Magic. There 
are a number of magical sources in this room.

3628
03:15:47,223 --> 03:15:52,140
There are a few vials on the back shelf, 
some of which appear to have been broken

3629
03:15:52,140 --> 03:15:54,934
and scattered on the ground, and the 
magic is fading.

3630
03:15:54,934 --> 03:16:03,014
There is one book that is actually in a 
chest that she goes and partially opens,

3631
03:16:03,014 --> 03:16:08,572
there is a book inside that is emanating 
some magical essence.

3632
03:16:08,572 --> 03:16:11,047
There is the doorway across the way.

3633
03:16:11,047 --> 03:16:16,396
But there is just a general magical presence, 
like a faint magical energy everywhere in here.

3634
03:16:16,396 --> 03:16:18,792
MARISHA: Which doorway across the way?

3635
03:16:18,792 --> 03:16:19,774
MATT: On the far end.

3636
03:16:19,774 --> 03:16:20,644
PATRICK: There is a doorway.

3637
03:16:20,644 --> 03:16:21,593
TRAVIS: Oh, there is?

3638
03:16:21,593 --> 03:16:23,197
MARISHA: I run over to inspect it.

3639
03:16:23,197 --> 03:16:24,058
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3640
03:16:24,058 --> 03:16:26,050
MARISHA: Try and get us out of here. 
Perception?

3641
03:16:26,050 --> 03:16:27,424
MATT: Investigation.

3642
03:16:27,424 --> 03:16:28,954
MARISHA: Oh, jesus fuck.

3643
03:16:28,954 --> 03:16:30,308
TALIESIN: What hit points am I at right 
now?

3644
03:16:30,308 --> 03:16:31,142
MARISHA: Seven.

3645
03:16:31,142 --> 03:16:36,450
MATT: Seven. The door looks like-- the door 
doesn't look like it's particularly intricate.

3646
03:16:36,450 --> 03:16:37,625
MARISHA: Trapped or anything?

3647
03:16:37,625 --> 03:16:40,232
MATT: It looks like it's locked or chained 
by something.

3648
03:16:40,232 --> 03:16:42,876
MARISHA: Vax, can you check for traps?

3649
03:16:42,876 --> 03:16:43,687
LIAM: Grog.

3650
03:16:43,687 --> 03:16:44,658
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3651
03:16:44,658 --> 03:16:46,011
LAURA: I'm going to third-level Cure 
Wounds you.

3652
03:16:46,011 --> 03:16:47,352
LIAM: Take him, take him.

3653
03:16:47,352 --> 03:16:48,091
TALIESIN: What am I at right now?

3654
03:16:48,091 --> 03:16:49,288
LAURA: You're probably at one.

3655
03:16:49,288 --> 03:16:50,369
TALIESIN: Okay, that'll do.

3656
03:16:50,369 --> 03:16:51,111
LAURA: So I'm going to Cure Wounds on you.

3657
03:16:51,111 --> 03:16:53,519
LIAM: All right. I head over to where 
Keyleth is and start looking for traps.

3658
03:16:53,519 --> 03:16:55,528
PATRICK: Can I Lay on Hands with him once 
he's back?

3659
03:16:55,528 --> 03:16:56,746
MATT: You can now, okay.

3660
03:16:56,746 --> 03:16:58,018
LIAM: I'm going to use my last Luck of 
the day.

3661
03:16:58,018 --> 03:16:59,144
PATRICK: So I can give you-- I'll give 
you 30.

3662
03:16:59,144 --> 03:17:00,944
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3663
03:17:00,944 --> 03:17:02,954
LIAM: I just used my last Luck of the 
day and I got two ones.

3664
03:17:02,954 --> 03:17:04,244
MATT: Two ones.

3665
03:17:04,244 --> 03:17:05,768
MARISHA: Are you fucking serious?

3666
03:17:05,768 --> 03:17:09,009
MATT: The door seems, not trapped, but it appears 
to be chained or locked from the other side.

3667
03:17:09,009 --> 03:17:13,350
TRAVIS: Fuck that shit. Titanstone 
Knuckles. I'm going through the door.

3668
03:17:13,350 --> 03:17:14,183
MATT: All right.

3669
03:17:14,183 --> 03:17:17,220
LIAM: Give him back, give him back.

3670
03:17:17,220 --> 03:17:18,957
MATT: All right. Roll a strength check.

3671
03:17:18,957 --> 03:17:23,537
TRAVIS: With advantage. That's good. 26.

3672
03:17:23,537 --> 03:17:24,387
LIAM: But it's not trapped, I checked it.

3673
03:17:24,387 --> 03:17:25,383
LAURA: 24.

3674
03:17:25,383 --> 03:17:29,729
MATT: 26. (punching sounds) You start 
slamming your fists against the door,

3675
03:17:29,729 --> 03:17:34,000
and as it splinters and then breaks 
inward, and then outward,

3676
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:43,942
and rocks just start tumbling outward, where 
once was the door in this vicinity here

3677
03:17:43,942 --> 03:17:48,142
now appears to be a cave-in on the 
opposite side.

3678
03:17:48,142 --> 03:17:54,726
MARISHA: Augh. I do my Stone Shape and 
I just punch the walls

3679
03:17:54,726 --> 03:17:58,527
and try and blast a hole through the 
fallen rubble with Stone Shape.

3680
03:17:58,527 --> 03:18:04,140
MATT: Okay. As you slam through, you smash a 
cylindrical space in, and it just meets more rock.

3681
03:18:04,140 --> 03:18:06,944
You get the sense that whatever chamber 
was beyond this room--

3682
03:18:06,944 --> 03:18:07,755
MARISHA: Is just a cave-in.

3683
03:18:07,755 --> 03:18:10,840
MATT: -- has just caved in.

3684
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:18,742
TALIESIN: I'm going to say something 
awful. Put him in the bag of colding.

3685
03:18:18,742 --> 03:18:25,000
It's not like he's breathing. It will 
keep him safe. Let's gather what we can.

3686
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:30,570
We have to walk out of here. There's no 
other way.

3687
03:18:30,570 --> 03:18:38,840
LAURA: Pike looks at the book that's emanating 
magic. Does it look like it's an evil book at all?

3688
03:18:38,840 --> 03:18:41,868
MATT: It has a sinister look to it.

3689
03:18:41,868 --> 03:18:52,495
It is ancient, the leather itself is darkened 
not by initial color but by just weather, age.

3690
03:18:52,495 --> 03:18:59,065
It has a very, very deep leathery-brown 
burgundy tint to it.

3691
03:18:59,065 --> 03:19:05,527
It has ancient brass inlays, and it is 
locked shut on one side.

3692
03:19:05,527 --> 03:19:09,961
LAURA: Pike's going to take off her scarf 
and throw it over it

3693
03:19:09,961 --> 03:19:12,776
and try to cover it and wrap it up in 
cloth.

3694
03:19:12,776 --> 03:19:13,947
MATT: Okay.

3695
03:19:13,947 --> 03:19:15,435
LAURA: And ask Grog to put it in the bag 
of holding

3696
03:19:15,435 --> 03:19:17,924
and wonder if that'll make the magic go 
away.

3697
03:19:17,924 --> 03:19:19,707
TRAVIS: Sure.

3698
03:19:19,707 --> 03:19:21,799
TALIESIN: I'm also just going to grab 
Grog really quickly and

3699
03:19:21,799 --> 03:19:25,466
just scrape as much stuff off the shelves 
into the bags

3700
03:19:25,466 --> 03:19:28,122
because we need to know what this shit is.

3701
03:19:28,122 --> 03:19:31,249
MATT: Okay. So you grab a number of the
tomes.

3702
03:19:31,249 --> 03:19:38,122
A number of them were destroyed from the 
impact of the Meteor Swarm, but the one--

3703
03:19:38,122 --> 03:19:41,803
you get a number of tomes in there, you get 
some odds and ends, some trinkets, some bones,

3704
03:19:41,803 --> 03:19:48,788
some other things that're around the territory. 
And that all seems to go in fine.

3705
03:19:48,788 --> 03:19:54,623
MARISHA: Keyleth goes over to the corpse 
of Raishan.

3706
03:19:54,623 --> 03:20:01,720
She takes the staff of Melora and shoves 
it down into her corpse.

3707
03:20:01,720 --> 03:20:04,530
Just to see if any reaction happens.

3708
03:20:04,530 --> 03:20:09,444
MATT: Okay. The staff slams into the 
flesh,

3709
03:20:09,444 --> 03:20:11,701
one of the exposed wounds on the 
side of Raishan's body.

3710
03:20:11,701 --> 03:20:20,864
As it sinks in, the staff seems to right itself 
in a standing position. You let go instinctually,

3711
03:20:20,864 --> 03:20:25,906
and you watch as the remaining visual of 
the black disease

3712
03:20:25,906 --> 03:20:28,091
that had begun to spread across the body

3713
03:20:28,091 --> 03:20:32,296
spreads rapidly across the entire 
body of Raishan.

3714
03:20:32,296 --> 03:20:38,041
What remains of green scale turns to 
black, and very very quickly

3715
03:20:38,041 --> 03:20:47,853
the corpse begins to wither and blacken 
and then turn to this rippled, fleshy husk.

3716
03:20:47,853 --> 03:20:53,529
The staff disengages and falls to the 
ground, clattering against the stone,

3717
03:20:53,529 --> 03:21:00,263
seeming that the remainder of the disease 
completed its cycle.

3718
03:21:00,263 --> 03:21:07,995
MARISHA: I just say, "That was for 
Scanlan from the Ashari. Bitch."

3719
03:21:07,995 --> 03:21:17,204
TALIESIN: I'm going to... Grog, help me pile 
all of the dragon remains into a pile. The eggs.

3720
03:21:17,204 --> 03:21:23,469
Everything. I need a pile. We're going to try and 
remove anything useful, especially of the eggs.

3721
03:21:23,469 --> 03:21:26,797
Anything to know what they were. But I 
don't want to take the whole thing,

3722
03:21:26,797 --> 03:21:30,711
I don't want to leave anything. We're going 
to burn it. We're going to burn it all.

3723
03:21:30,711 --> 03:21:32,792
LAURA: I take the gate stone and put it 
back.

3724
03:21:32,792 --> 03:21:33,811
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3725
03:21:33,811 --> 03:21:36,006
PATRICK: Knock out these pillars, it'll 
cave this whole thing in.

3726
03:21:36,006 --> 03:21:36,873
MATT: Okay.

3727
03:21:36,873 --> 03:21:40,006
TALIESIN: I still want to burn it, but 
yeah.

3728
03:21:40,006 --> 03:21:46,050
MATT: As you, Kerrek, walk toward one of 
the edges of the pillars there,

3729
03:21:46,050 --> 03:21:51,188
there is a flash on the ground, a magical 
glyph or a symbol of some kind that triggers,

3730
03:21:51,188 --> 03:21:53,894
and your body is immediately wracked with 
horrible pain.

3731
03:21:53,894 --> 03:21:55,354
I need you to make a constitution saving 
throw.

3732
03:21:55,354 --> 03:21:59,196
TALIESIN: Jesus.

3733
03:21:59,196 --> 03:22:01,382
LAURA: Let's not walk around this place 
anymore.

3734
03:22:01,382 --> 03:22:04,453
PATRICK: 11.

3735
03:22:04,453 --> 03:22:05,689
MATT: 11.

3736
03:22:05,689 --> 03:22:08,132
PATRICK: No no no, wait wait wait, with 
constitution I get...

3737
03:22:08,132 --> 03:22:09,461
MATT: I'll make sure it's constitution.

3738
03:22:09,461 --> 03:22:15,400
PATRICK: Plus seven. 15. 18. I probably 
should've been making some of these saving throws

3739
03:22:15,400 --> 03:22:19,791
by adding the right numbers to them.

3740
03:22:19,791 --> 03:22:21,522
LIAM: Eh, that's D&amp;D, man.

3741
03:22:21,522 --> 03:22:27,304
TALIESIN: It's math-lite.

3742
03:22:27,304 --> 03:22:31,375
MATT: Let me see and make sure it was the 
right one. Yeah, okay.

3743
03:22:31,375 --> 03:22:34,090
So as the excruciating pain takes over,

3744
03:22:34,090 --> 03:22:39,956
you instinctually start screaming as your 
muscles lock up and you are unable to move.

3745
03:22:39,956 --> 03:22:42,933
You guys all look over suddenly as Kerrek 
is just locked in place,

3746
03:22:42,933 --> 03:22:47,467
all the muscles pulled into this tense 
moment, just screaming in place.

3747
03:22:47,467 --> 03:22:50,132
TRAVIS: Kerr?

3748
03:22:50,132 --> 03:22:52,137
MARISHA: What is he grabbing onto? Is he 
grabbing onto something?

3749
03:22:52,137 --> 03:22:54,266
MATT: Nothing. He just walked toward one 
of the pillars--

3750
03:22:54,266 --> 03:22:55,351
TALIESIN: And hit a glyph.

3751
03:22:55,351 --> 03:22:56,871
MATT: In the central area here.

3752
03:22:56,871 --> 03:22:57,998
TALIESIN: Someone shove him off.

3753
03:22:57,998 --> 03:23:02,157
LAURA: I'm going to use my Rope of 
Entanglement and grab him.

3754
03:23:02,157 --> 03:23:04,071
MATT: Okay. You pull him off,

3755
03:23:04,071 --> 03:23:07,705
the glyph still remains glowing in place, 
and he clatters to the ground,

3756
03:23:07,705 --> 03:23:11,204
still locked up. You don't even see color 
or shape right now,

3757
03:23:11,204 --> 03:23:14,161
it's just white from the pain that is 
wracking your body.

3758
03:23:14,161 --> 03:23:16,868
You are unable to move, make 
conscious thought.

3759
03:23:16,868 --> 03:23:20,376
You are purely a primal entity that is 
suffering right now.

3760
03:23:20,376 --> 03:23:21,792
TRAVIS: Can you smash glyphs?

3761
03:23:21,792 --> 03:23:23,414
LIAM: I walk over, I'm going to try--

3762
03:23:23,414 --> 03:23:26,268
PATRICK: Actually, it's not much-- this 
is almost better than what I had before.

3763
03:23:26,268 --> 03:23:28,066
(all laugh)

3764
03:23:28,066 --> 03:23:30,566
LIAM: I kneel down and try Lay on Hands 
on him,

3765
03:23:30,566 --> 03:23:35,508
because it can cure multiple diseases and 
cure poisons with a single use.

3766
03:23:35,508 --> 03:23:37,021
MATT: Okay. So you spend five of your 
hit points.

3767
03:23:37,021 --> 03:23:38,009
LIAM: Sure, five.

3768
03:23:38,009 --> 03:23:45,608
MATT: Doesn't seem to assuage him. 
Almost biting through his tongue.

3769
03:23:45,608 --> 03:23:49,451
Allura immediately looks over and is 
going to attempt to dispel.

3770
03:23:49,451 --> 03:23:50,638
LIAM: Is he cursed?

3771
03:23:50,638 --> 03:23:53,707
MATT: Which succeeds, actually, she 
rolled a 15 plus-- so.

3772
03:23:53,707 --> 03:23:58,134
The pain subsides immediately, and she 
puts her hood back up.

3773
03:23:58,134 --> 03:24:01,278
As your breath begins to regulate--

3774
03:24:01,278 --> 03:24:02,447
TALIESIN: Let's get out of here.

3775
03:24:02,447 --> 03:24:04,500
MARISHA: What was that?

3776
03:24:04,500 --> 03:24:06,807
ALLURA: Dragon left a symbol.

3777
03:24:06,807 --> 03:24:08,411
MARISHA: A symbol?

3778
03:24:08,411 --> 03:24:13,939
ALLURA: Don't worry about it, it's gone now. 
Just do not touch that for the next ten minutes.

3779
03:24:13,939 --> 03:24:19,466
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly search 
Scanlan's body for his wand.

3780
03:24:19,466 --> 03:24:20,716
TRAVIS: Of Fireballs, or--?

3781
03:24:20,716 --> 03:24:23,717
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm going to shoot some 
Fireballs in here when we're on our way out.

3782
03:24:23,717 --> 03:24:24,762
MARISHA: You're going to burn it to the 
ground?

3783
03:24:24,762 --> 03:24:26,353
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn it to the 
fucking ground.

3784
03:24:26,353 --> 03:24:27,450
MARISHA: I can help you with that.

3785
03:24:27,450 --> 03:24:28,437
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3786
03:24:28,437 --> 03:24:29,858
MATT: As can I.

3787
03:24:29,858 --> 03:24:33,142
MARISHA: As we leave, we help burn this 
motherfucker to the ground.

3788
03:24:33,142 --> 03:24:37,116
MATT: All right. As you guys begin to 
walk out, the three of you,

3789
03:24:37,116 --> 03:24:40,800
between your staff, your wand, and 
Allura's preparation, you guys just

3790
03:24:40,800 --> 03:24:43,935
(fire, explosion sounds).

3791
03:24:43,935 --> 03:24:49,009
And you watch as elements of the stonework 
begin to fall into itself and collapse.

3792
03:24:49,009 --> 03:24:53,779
Not enough to the point where it causes a 
full cave-in to be endangering to you,

3793
03:24:53,779 --> 03:25:00,932
but you ensure that this space is no longer used 
for whatever purpose it was being used for.

3794
03:25:00,932 --> 03:25:07,105
You guys continue back out to the edge of 
the chasm where the bridge is currently--

3795
03:25:07,105 --> 03:25:08,148
PATRICK: The bridge got snapped, didn't 
it?

3796
03:25:08,148 --> 03:25:09,256
MATT: It did, yeah.

3797
03:25:09,256 --> 03:25:10,247
TALIESIN: But the gravity is off.

3798
03:25:10,247 --> 03:25:11,181
PATRICK: Now the gravity's regular.

3799
03:25:11,181 --> 03:25:12,617
MATT: Yes.

3800
03:25:12,617 --> 03:25:13,782
LIAM: We can ferry back and forth on 
the carpet.

3801
03:25:13,782 --> 03:25:15,830
LAURA: Yeah, ferry on the carpet and 
the broom.

3802
03:25:15,830 --> 03:25:19,950
MATT: Okay. You get across without issue.

3803
03:25:19,950 --> 03:25:25,937
LAURA: Pike casts Light on her mace so that it's 
a nicely lit thing, it's not all creepy and dark.

3804
03:25:25,937 --> 03:25:28,375
MATT: All right. You guys make your way across 
the chasm.

3805
03:25:28,375 --> 03:25:32,815
You can still hear below, and occasionally as 
you glance down as the light opens the area below,

3806
03:25:32,815 --> 03:25:37,136
you can see the masses of writhing bodies 
that are all reaching up from below,

3807
03:25:37,136 --> 03:25:45,817
but with no magical gravitational trap in effect, 
they have no effect and are kept at a distance.

3808
03:25:45,817 --> 03:25:51,853
You make your way across, heading back towards 
the spiral staircase upwards. The glyph--

3809
03:25:51,853 --> 03:25:54,947
MARISHA: Avoiding all that stairs-trap 
stuff.

3810
03:25:54,947 --> 03:25:58,209
MATT: Yeah, the glyph is still dispelled 
from earlier.

3811
03:25:58,209 --> 03:26:04,804
You guys still make your way up in sections 
using your-- the broom and the magic carpet.

3812
03:26:04,804 --> 03:26:10,147
As you make your way up into the next 
chamber, you begin to hear cackling laughter.

3813
03:26:10,147 --> 03:26:14,884
MARISHA: Are these the fucking ghostrider 
skulls again?

3814
03:26:14,884 --> 03:26:20,252
MATT: You hear (cackling) from ahead, and you 
see a little bit of a light source begin to appear

3815
03:26:20,252 --> 03:26:25,719
from the iron door room that you guys had 
your first encounter with--

3816
03:26:25,719 --> 03:26:28,005
MARISHA: Are they all just like right 
down--

3817
03:26:28,005 --> 03:26:29,996
MATT: They're not quite in sight yet.

3818
03:26:29,996 --> 03:26:33,952
You can just see the glow as they're 
descending down a grade.

3819
03:26:33,952 --> 03:26:35,478
MARISHA: And we're kind of in a 
hallway, right?

3820
03:26:35,478 --> 03:26:36,242
MATT: Yeah.

3821
03:26:36,242 --> 03:26:37,547
LAURA: Are they technically undead?

3822
03:26:37,547 --> 03:26:38,919
LIAM: Yes.

3823
03:26:38,919 --> 03:26:42,114
LAURA: Then Pike's going to use her--

3824
03:26:42,114 --> 03:26:44,841
Yeah, she's going to use Turn Undead on 
those motherfuckers.

3825
03:26:44,841 --> 03:26:46,113
MARISHA: Yes.

3826
03:26:46,113 --> 03:26:52,842
MATT: Okay. Looking at the radius of Turn 
Undead.

3827
03:26:52,842 --> 03:26:55,197
I'll just double-check here, because it's 
pretty close.

3828
03:26:55,197 --> 03:26:57,061
LIAM: Destroy Undead.

3829
03:26:57,061 --> 03:26:58,124
PATRICK: If she's got it.

3830
03:26:58,124 --> 03:27:03,270
MATT: It would be Destroy Undead at fifth 
level, which she has. But yeah.

3831
03:27:03,270 --> 03:27:06,514
It's 30 feet near you. So she can wait.

3832
03:27:06,514 --> 03:27:09,145
LAURA: But they can shoot Fireballs, so 
maybe that's not smart.

3833
03:27:09,145 --> 03:27:13,687
TALIESIN: I'll actually say, the second that 
we see them, I'm just going to empty the wand.

3834
03:27:13,687 --> 03:27:14,958
PATRICK: It's fire, though.

3835
03:27:14,958 --> 03:27:15,808
LAURA: Yeah.

3836
03:27:15,808 --> 03:27:16,734
TALIESIN: Oh, will they just be fine?

3837
03:27:16,734 --> 03:27:18,817
MARISHA: Yeah, they're immune to fire. 
We need radiant damage.

3838
03:27:18,817 --> 03:27:21,137
LAURA: I'm going to just shoot them with arrows 
and try to get them from far away, I guess.

3839
03:27:21,137 --> 03:27:24,070
MATT: All right. So you guys are holding your 
action for when they come into range, essentially.

3840
03:27:24,070 --> 03:27:25,731
MARISHA: Can I see them yet?

3841
03:27:25,731 --> 03:27:29,981
PATRICK: Is this like a straight tunnel, a 
straight featureless tunnel heading towards us?

3842
03:27:29,981 --> 03:27:31,779
MATT: It's a slow grade downward.

3843
03:27:31,779 --> 03:27:37,848
You guys are heading back up the pathway, 
and you see them now coming in your direction.

3844
03:27:37,848 --> 03:27:39,833
TALIESIN: Can I just unload on them, I 
suppose?

3845
03:27:39,833 --> 03:27:41,189
MATT: Once they come into range.

3846
03:27:41,189 --> 03:27:42,955
TRAVIS: Is it all four of them?

3847
03:27:42,955 --> 03:27:43,807
MATT: You're not sure.

3848
03:27:43,807 --> 03:27:45,998
PATRICK: We just can't clump like we 
were before.

3849
03:27:45,998 --> 03:27:47,681
MARISHA: I've got a Sunbeam ready 
to go.

3850
03:27:47,681 --> 03:27:48,708
TALIESIN: Oh, well.

3851
03:27:48,708 --> 03:27:51,549
LAURA: Well, yours has a probably 
good range on it.

3852
03:27:51,549 --> 03:27:53,507
MARISHA: 60 foot. But I want to get 
them in a line.

3853
03:27:53,507 --> 03:27:56,313
LAURA: I've got 120 feet on my bow.

3854
03:27:56,313 --> 03:27:58,696
TALIESIN: I've got disgusting range.

3855
03:27:58,696 --> 03:28:01,020
MATT: All right, so you guys, hearing 
the cackling and seeing the glow coming,

3856
03:28:01,020 --> 03:28:02,512
you hold your actions. You're holding 
your bow,

3857
03:28:02,512 --> 03:28:04,762
you're holding a Sunbeam, you're 
holding your attacks.

3858
03:28:04,762 --> 03:28:06,157
MARISHA: I'm going to line them up.

3859
03:28:06,157 --> 03:28:08,990
MATT: That would give you guys immediate 
action as soon as they arrive. So.

3860
03:28:08,990 --> 03:28:14,553
Sure enough, within a moment you watch 
as four of them come into view,

3861
03:28:14,553 --> 03:28:17,505
the same four that you destroyed earlier, 
clustered around.

3862
03:28:17,505 --> 03:28:24,395
There's two lines of two, essentially. So.

3863
03:28:24,395 --> 03:28:26,540
TRAVIS: Do they regenerate?

3864
03:28:26,540 --> 03:28:27,916
LAURA: So I'm going to do--

3865
03:28:27,916 --> 03:28:33,070
TRAVIS: They just grow back? Like, we 
shattered two of 'em.

3866
03:28:33,070 --> 03:28:35,738
MARISHA: I have a feeling there's a 
bunch of these guys.

3867
03:28:35,738 --> 03:28:37,158
TRAVIS: Fuck.

3868
03:28:37,158 --> 03:28:43,657
MATT: So, Keyleth. Sunbeam can only affect two 
of them. So they get their saving throw, right?

3869
03:28:43,657 --> 03:28:50,088
Roll 8d6, if you could. They... (laughs) 
they do not make their saving throws.

3870
03:28:50,088 --> 03:28:54,434
MARISHA: That's right. Five, six, need 
two more.

3871
03:28:54,434 --> 03:28:55,452
TALIESIN: What do you need?

3872
03:28:55,452 --> 03:28:56,912
MARISHA: d6s.

3873
03:28:56,912 --> 03:29:04,104
TALIESIN: That's a lot of whiskey.

3874
03:29:04,104 --> 03:29:14,797
MARISHA: (counting) 27 radiant damage.

3875
03:29:14,797 --> 03:29:23,173
MATT: 27 radiant damage to both of them. 
All righty. Got you. All right. Percival?

3876
03:29:23,173 --> 03:29:30,772
TALIESIN: I'm going to try doing a 
sharpshooter piercing shot

3877
03:29:30,772 --> 03:29:45,069
on another round of them with the 
Pepperbox. Sharpshooter piercing shot.

3878
03:29:45,069 --> 03:29:47,791
LAURA: Pike's going to do Sacred Flame 
on them, too.

3879
03:29:47,791 --> 03:29:52,891
MATT: Okay.

3880
03:29:52,891 --> 03:29:58,620
TALIESIN: That's not bad. So that's-- 
the first shot is--

3881
03:29:58,620 --> 03:30:00,574
MARISHA: It's good.

3882
03:30:00,574 --> 03:30:01,625
TALIESIN: 16.

3883
03:30:01,625 --> 03:30:02,712
MATT: Hits.

3884
03:30:02,712 --> 03:30:15,057
TALIESIN: Oh, then they all hit. That's good. 
So that's 1d10 plus 1d6, so 1d10 plus 1d6.

3885
03:30:15,057 --> 03:30:30,479
And this is piercing shot so it's the enemy line, 
so. Wow. That's nice. That's-- I have no brain.

3886
03:30:30,479 --> 03:30:36,202
27 points of damage, with five points of 
psychic damage for the first shot.

3887
03:30:36,202 --> 03:30:38,214
MATT: Okay, so 19 total.

3888
03:30:38,214 --> 03:30:40,653
They appear-- the blasts of the bullets 
don't seem to be

3889
03:30:40,653 --> 03:30:43,054
doing as much damage as other forms 
of attack.

3890
03:30:43,054 --> 03:30:45,070
TALIESIN: Okay, but it's hitting both of 
them in a row.

3891
03:30:45,070 --> 03:30:46,700
MATT: Right. Yeah.

3892
03:30:46,700 --> 03:30:57,068
TALIESIN: Next shot is-- ha! Is 28 points 
of damage with four points of psychic.

3893
03:30:57,068 --> 03:31:00,556
MATT: Okay, this is the ones she damaged 
with the Sunbeam?

3894
03:31:00,556 --> 03:31:01,876
TALIESIN: Mm-hm.

3895
03:31:01,876 --> 03:31:03,430
MATT: Both of those skulls just 
(explosion sound).

3896
03:31:03,430 --> 03:31:08,641
As soon as the beam streaks past, blasting 
into two of them, two piercing shots in a row,

3897
03:31:08,641 --> 03:31:13,811
you can watch as their eyes begin to glow, 
flames glowing within the back of the skull.

3898
03:31:13,811 --> 03:31:18,550
Two of them immediately just scatter into 
dust and bone. The two on the other side.

3899
03:31:18,550 --> 03:31:24,275
TALIESIN: I still have one last shot, so. 
Let's do slightly less that time.

3900
03:31:24,275 --> 03:31:26,926
20 points of damage with one point 
of psychic.

3901
03:31:26,926 --> 03:31:27,925
MATT: Okay.

3902
03:31:27,925 --> 03:31:29,954
TALIESIN: And that's my contribution 
to the world.

3903
03:31:29,954 --> 03:31:30,812
MATT: All right.

3904
03:31:30,812 --> 03:31:33,272
LAURA: Pike does Sacred Flame.

3905
03:31:33,272 --> 03:31:34,856
MATT: What level?

3906
03:31:34,856 --> 03:31:39,001
LAURA: She's a 17th level cleric now.

3907
03:31:39,001 --> 03:31:40,544
MATT: Right, but what spell level?

3908
03:31:40,544 --> 03:31:43,212
LAURA: It's a cantrip.

3909
03:31:43,212 --> 03:31:44,719
MATT: Oh, that's right.

3910
03:31:44,719 --> 03:31:45,963
LAURA: So it's just 4d8 damage.

3911
03:31:45,963 --> 03:31:47,018
MATT: Okay, yeah.

3912
03:31:47,018 --> 03:31:48,207
TALIESIN: 4d8 radiant?

3913
03:31:48,207 --> 03:32:00,487
LAURA: Mm-hm, 4d8 radiant damage. 
Oh yeah, that's good. 22 radiant damage.

3914
03:32:00,487 --> 03:32:06,453
They have to do a dexterity saving throw.

3915
03:32:06,453 --> 03:32:07,655
MATT: Nope.

3916
03:32:07,655 --> 03:32:10,202
LAURA: Cool. So one of them takes
22 damage.

3917
03:32:10,202 --> 03:32:11,495
MATT: Nice.

3918
03:32:11,495 --> 03:32:12,889
LAURA: I'm going to do the one that 
Percy just hit.

3919
03:32:12,889 --> 03:32:13,852
MATT: All righty.

3920
03:32:13,852 --> 03:32:15,362
TALIESIN: I hit both of them.

3921
03:32:15,362 --> 03:32:16,699
LAURA: Oh. Well, there's four of them.

3922
03:32:16,699 --> 03:32:18,346
TALIESIN: Two are down, the other two 
are damaged.

3923
03:32:18,346 --> 03:32:24,265
LAURA: Cool, well, she chooses one. And then 
I'm going to, as Vex, shoot arrows at them.

3924
03:32:24,265 --> 03:32:27,245
MATT: Go for it.

3925
03:32:27,245 --> 03:32:34,854
LAURA: That doesn't hit because the world 
hates me tonight. And that one hits.

3926
03:32:34,854 --> 03:32:54,362
MATT: All right.

3927
03:32:54,362 --> 03:33:00,927
LAURA: 17 damage.

3928
03:33:00,927 --> 03:33:05,375
MATT: All righty. 17 to the one that's 
over there.

3929
03:33:05,375 --> 03:33:10,211
Allura, who is frustrated and 
understanding what their resistances are,

3930
03:33:10,211 --> 03:33:14,485
she's going to go ahead and cast a 
high-level Magic Missile.

3931
03:33:14,485 --> 03:33:23,068
TALIESIN: Classic.

3932
03:33:23,068 --> 03:33:25,332
MATT: Okay. That one just explodes 
and scatters,

3933
03:33:25,332 --> 03:33:29,773
so now there is one left that is just 
partially damaged from Percival.

3934
03:33:29,773 --> 03:33:31,659
PATRICK: Are they within 30 feet?

3935
03:33:31,659 --> 03:33:32,824
MATT: Not quite yet.

3936
03:33:32,824 --> 03:33:37,983
PATRICK: Then I leave the ring of 
invisibility off, and I just charge.

3937
03:33:37,983 --> 03:33:39,527
MATT: You just charge in?

3938
03:33:39,527 --> 03:33:43,832
PATRICK: I'm heading toward them, because 
if they hit me and I'm far enough away,

3939
03:33:43,832 --> 03:33:45,951
it won't hit the whole group.

3940
03:33:45,951 --> 03:33:49,560
MATT: Okay. As you go rushing in, that 
triggers them--

3941
03:33:49,560 --> 03:33:55,706
or the one that's remaining to go ahead, 
and it's going to fire two Fire Rays at you.

3942
03:33:55,706 --> 03:33:58,079
MARISHA: Fire Rays?

3943
03:33:58,079 --> 03:34:00,195
MATT: That is 20 to hit?

3944
03:34:00,195 --> 03:34:01,493
PATRICK: Yes it will.

3945
03:34:01,493 --> 03:34:02,505
MATT: And 24 to hit.

3946
03:34:02,505 --> 03:34:05,128
PATRICK: That one won't, strangely 
enough. No, it did.

3947
03:34:05,128 --> 03:34:07,373
(all laugh)

3948
03:34:07,373 --> 03:34:10,082
MATT: That would be strange.

3949
03:34:10,082 --> 03:34:11,716
MARISHA: I want that class.

3950
03:34:11,716 --> 03:34:13,649
MATT: That is 13 points of fire damage 
on one.

3951
03:34:13,649 --> 03:34:14,971
PATRICK: Okay.

3952
03:34:14,971 --> 03:34:17,296
MATT: And seven points of fire damage
on the other.

3953
03:34:17,296 --> 03:34:18,620
PATRICK: I will take that.

3954
03:34:18,620 --> 03:34:26,054
MATT: All right. You watch as both eyes streak 
out these burning rays of flame in his direction.

3955
03:34:26,054 --> 03:34:29,426
Both blast him in the shoulder, one hits 
him in the side of the knee and thigh,

3956
03:34:29,426 --> 03:34:38,768
but Kerrek keeps running forward. You can 
go ahead and make your attacks if you want.

3957
03:34:38,768 --> 03:34:40,087
PATRICK: 19.

3958
03:34:40,087 --> 03:34:42,299
MATT: Hits.

3959
03:34:42,299 --> 03:34:50,528
PATRICK: And-- actually, that's way better 
than 19, I'm counting dumb. This is 18.

3960
03:34:50,528 --> 03:34:51,805
MATT: 18 hits.

3961
03:34:51,805 --> 03:35:00,197
PATRICK: Okay. So for the first one, I'm 
going to burn one for Divine Smite.

3962
03:35:00,197 --> 03:35:01,732
MATT: All righty.

3963
03:35:01,732 --> 03:35:03,026
PATRICK: And these are undead.

3964
03:35:03,026 --> 03:35:04,564
MATT: Yes they are.

3965
03:35:04,564 --> 03:35:21,623
PATRICK: Eight... eh. 11. 17. 25.

3966
03:35:21,623 --> 03:35:24,172
MATT: 25 for both hits? That's the first 
one.

3967
03:35:24,172 --> 03:35:25,507
PATRICK: The first hit.

3968
03:35:25,507 --> 03:35:26,876
MATT: All right, so do the second hit now.

3969
03:35:26,876 --> 03:35:30,431
PATRICK: And that doesn't do it? Just to 
make sure I didn't kill it with the first one?

3970
03:35:30,431 --> 03:35:31,585
MATT: It doesn't destroy it, no.

3971
03:35:31,585 --> 03:35:33,233
PATRICK: Okay, then the second one--

3972
03:35:33,233 --> 03:35:36,365
MATT: It does crack the skull and you 
watch as the sutures cave in from below,

3973
03:35:36,365 --> 03:35:38,066
the light of your hammer still--

3974
03:35:38,066 --> 03:35:39,632
LAURA: These are hardy skulls.

3975
03:35:39,632 --> 03:35:48,442
PATRICK: Right, and 12... 22... 23... 31. 
All radiant.

3976
03:35:48,442 --> 03:35:52,336
MATT: 31, that'll do it. With that, the 
first blow knocks it almost to the ground.

3977
03:35:52,336 --> 03:35:57,416
As it begins to lift up again, its mouth 
(cackling), you hit it with the side of the hammer,

3978
03:35:57,416 --> 03:35:59,939
and it just scatters into broken bone 
chunks and shards

3979
03:35:59,939 --> 03:36:04,451
that splatter against the wall and rattle 
down the grade a bit

3980
03:36:04,451 --> 03:36:07,393
towards your direction as Kerrek turns around, 
looking back over his shoulder at you guys,

3981
03:36:07,393 --> 03:36:09,612
the pathway now clear ahead of you.

3982
03:36:09,612 --> 03:36:17,503
PATRICK: It's matter-of-fact, there was 
no serpentine, it was like--

3983
03:36:17,503 --> 03:36:20,520
and then it was just cutting wood.

3984
03:36:20,520 --> 03:36:23,793
MATT: Yeah. You guys continue forward.

3985
03:36:23,793 --> 03:36:27,003
You make your way to the chamber 
with the iron door, still open,

3986
03:36:27,003 --> 03:36:32,566
eventually walking to the outskirts of 
the entranceway to the sanctum.

3987
03:36:32,566 --> 03:36:41,598
You now walk carefully around the 
previously noticed patches of dirt and sand.

3988
03:36:41,598 --> 03:36:44,501
LAURA: Oh, I grab those immovable 
rods when we get out of there.

3989
03:36:44,501 --> 03:36:51,506
MATT: Right. And as you pull them out, 
it seals the tunnel once more behind you.

3990
03:36:51,506 --> 03:36:53,018
LIAM: Let's find a tree.

3991
03:36:53,018 --> 03:36:55,176
TRAVIS: Yeah, how do we go?

3992
03:36:55,176 --> 03:36:57,059
MARISHA: Allura, do you have any more 
teleportations left?

3993
03:36:57,059 --> 03:36:58,388
MATT: No, that was the one.

3994
03:36:58,388 --> 03:37:00,988
MARISHA: Let's find a big ol' tree, then. 
I'll burn my seventh-level spell.

3995
03:37:00,988 --> 03:37:03,719
LIAM: Do we see any trees? Everything was 
dead the closer we got to the central--

3996
03:37:03,719 --> 03:37:06,258
MARISHA: We have to get to a living tree 
that we can all fit through.

3997
03:37:06,258 --> 03:37:07,878
MATT: Actually, she goes,

3998
03:37:07,878 --> 03:37:14,707
"I do have a teleportation circle, so I 
may be able to bring us to Emon."

3999
03:37:14,707 --> 03:37:17,791
MARISHA: Do we want to go to Emon or 
anywhere else?

4000
03:37:17,791 --> 03:37:21,517
LAURA: We can go to Greyskull Keep.

4001
03:37:21,517 --> 03:37:22,521
TRAVIS: Why, what's there?

4002
03:37:22,521 --> 03:37:24,718
MARISHA: Can you get us to Greyskull 
Keep, or at least the--

4003
03:37:24,718 --> 03:37:27,053
TRAVIS: We need something that'll get
Scanlan. What's the quickest--

4004
03:37:27,053 --> 03:37:28,929
LAURA: Sarenrae's temple.

4005
03:37:28,929 --> 03:37:30,190
TRAVIS: Is at Greyskull Keep, or--

4006
03:37:30,190 --> 03:37:32,367
LAURA: I mean, that's where our chapel 
is in our house.

4007
03:37:32,367 --> 03:37:34,874
MARISHA: Pike and I have a little temple, 
yeah.

4008
03:37:34,874 --> 03:37:36,123
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

4009
03:37:36,123 --> 03:37:40,123
MATT: That's one of the few teleportation sigils 
that still exist, in that vicinity at least.

4010
03:37:40,123 --> 03:37:41,929
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it, do it. Yeah.

4011
03:37:41,929 --> 03:37:45,412
MARISHA: If it doesn't work at Sarenrae's temple, 
I can use a treestride to get us elsewhere.

4012
03:37:45,412 --> 03:37:46,878
Let's get to Greyskull Keep.

4013
03:37:46,878 --> 03:37:48,397
MATT: "All right."

4014
03:37:48,397 --> 03:37:51,649
She gets down and begins marking out the 
symbol on the ground on the outskirts.

4015
03:37:51,649 --> 03:38:04,479
She finishes, you watch the arcane flash.

4016
03:38:04,479 --> 03:38:07,644
TRAVIS: No. No. No.

4017
03:38:07,644 --> 03:38:17,335
MATT: She steps onto the circle and 
vanishes. The teleportation circle.

4018
03:38:17,335 --> 03:38:28,532
And Kima's about to go behind her, and Kima goes, 
"I don't... it doesn't usually look like that."

4019
03:38:28,532 --> 03:38:31,836
MARISHA: What? Allura didn't vanish, 
did she?

4020
03:38:31,836 --> 03:38:34,627
MATT: Allura stepped onto it after 
casting it and then vanished.

4021
03:38:34,627 --> 03:38:36,838
There was a weird sparkle of electrical
energy.

4022
03:38:36,838 --> 03:38:39,003
TRAVIS: What do you mean, it doesn't look 
like that normally?

4023
03:38:39,003 --> 03:38:42,506
MATT: I don't know. I don't know!

4024
03:38:42,506 --> 03:38:45,010
MARISHA: Do we follow or do something 
else?

4025
03:38:45,010 --> 03:38:47,166
LAURA: I don't understand. No, Kima!

4026
03:38:47,166 --> 03:38:48,002
MARISHA: Kima!

4027
03:38:48,002 --> 03:38:50,794
MATT: And Kima just walks in after her. 
Sparks once more.

4028
03:38:50,794 --> 03:38:53,386
LAURA: Does anybody know what the fuck--

4029
03:38:53,386 --> 03:38:54,760
TRAVIS: What did that mean?

4030
03:38:54,760 --> 03:38:56,383
LAURA: What was that supposed to look 
like? What it was supposed to look like?

4031
03:38:56,383 --> 03:38:58,710
MARISHA: Can we do some sort of check?

4032
03:38:58,710 --> 03:39:00,281
PATRICK: I don't know arcane.

4033
03:39:00,281 --> 03:39:01,603
MARISHA: I don't either.

4034
03:39:01,603 --> 03:39:02,992
LAURA: (tearfully) Scanlan does.

4035
03:39:02,992 --> 03:39:04,564
MARISHA: (tearfully) Scanlan does. 
He would know.

4036
03:39:04,564 --> 03:39:06,196
MATT: You can make an arcana check.

4037
03:39:06,196 --> 03:39:08,011
TALIESIN: I'd love to make an arcana 
check.

4038
03:39:08,011 --> 03:39:09,517
MARISHA: For Scanlan!

4039
03:39:09,517 --> 03:39:11,596
PATRICK: I'll roll the bones in case 
it's a religious thing.

4040
03:39:11,596 --> 03:39:13,705
LAURA: I mean, as perception thing, if 
we've seen a teleportation circle before,

4041
03:39:13,705 --> 03:39:16,079
would we at least know that it doesn't 
look like it's supposed to?

4042
03:39:16,079 --> 03:39:21,244
MARISHA: (yells) Nothing. I don't know 
shit.

4043
03:39:21,244 --> 03:39:23,069
TALIESIN: 22.

4044
03:39:23,069 --> 03:39:23,853
MATT: 22?

4045
03:39:23,853 --> 03:39:25,650
TALIESIN: Yep.

4046
03:39:25,650 --> 03:39:28,374
MATT: As you get closer and look at it-- 
you've seen a few teleportation circles,

4047
03:39:28,374 --> 03:39:35,463
and once they're down they just kind of glow 
with this mild energy until they dissipate.

4048
03:39:35,463 --> 03:39:42,656
Which is pretty rapid. Let's see here.

4049
03:39:42,656 --> 03:39:46,193
TRAVIS: We need those two, right, to do 
what we need to do. We have to go with them.

4050
03:39:46,193 --> 03:39:47,423
TALIESIN: We don't.

4051
03:39:47,423 --> 03:39:48,680
LAURA: We don't.

4052
03:39:48,680 --> 03:39:53,037
MARISHA: I can get us there via tree. If 
we need to. There's a tree in Sarenrae's--

4053
03:39:53,037 --> 03:39:57,107
TRAVIS: You'd better be right. If we 
leave those two behind.

4054
03:39:57,107 --> 03:39:59,212
MATT: Yeah, it only lasts for a round, 
so it's--

4055
03:39:59,212 --> 03:40:00,270
TALIESIN: Six seconds.

4056
03:40:00,270 --> 03:40:01,203
MATT: Yeah, six seconds.

4057
03:40:01,203 --> 03:40:02,420
LAURA: So we have to make this 
decision stat?

4058
03:40:02,420 --> 03:40:03,119
MATT: Now.

4059
03:40:03,119 --> 03:40:04,280
LAURA: But what if it took them 
somewhere--

4060
03:40:04,280 --> 03:40:09,361
MATT: You glancing at it, there is a 
flicker to it and weird (crackling),

4061
03:40:09,361 --> 03:40:12,836
very similar to the weird flash that 
you saw when you were inside

4062
03:40:12,836 --> 03:40:15,549
and attempted the original teleportation. 
There's something--

4063
03:40:15,549 --> 03:40:18,304
you get the sense that there's something 
about this--

4064
03:40:18,304 --> 03:40:20,955
either this mountain or this underground 
area,

4065
03:40:20,955 --> 03:40:27,843
there's something that has some sort of influence 
or impact on any sort of transportation magic.

4066
03:40:27,843 --> 03:40:30,710
MARISHA: Who knows where they just got 
teleported to?

4067
03:40:30,710 --> 03:40:32,471
PATRICK: Or if they ended up anywhere at 
all.

4068
03:40:32,471 --> 03:40:33,860
TRAVIS: Do we need them?

4069
03:40:33,860 --> 03:40:36,339
LIAM: I mean, the amount of talking we're 
doing, it's already closed at this point.

4070
03:40:36,339 --> 03:40:37,478
MATT: It's gone.

4071
03:40:37,478 --> 03:40:38,374
LAURA: Oh my god.

4072
03:40:38,374 --> 03:40:39,373
MARISHA: Fuck.

4073
03:40:39,373 --> 03:40:40,789
TRAVIS: Go find a tree. We all start 
running.

4074
03:40:40,789 --> 03:40:41,995
MARISHA: No no no.

4075
03:40:41,995 --> 03:40:43,169
TALIESIN: No.

4076
03:40:43,169 --> 03:40:44,862
MARISHA: Yeah, we find a tree, we find 
a tree.

4077
03:40:44,862 --> 03:40:47,335
TALIESIN: We go to the beach and we find 
a tree. We get as far away from this cave.

4078
03:40:47,335 --> 03:40:48,628
PATRICK: As far away.

4079
03:40:48,628 --> 03:40:49,553
LIAM: Yes.

4080
03:40:49,553 --> 03:40:51,764
LAURA: What if-- where did they just go? What 
if we just sent them to some plane of existence?

4081
03:40:51,764 --> 03:40:54,141
MARISHA: I don't know. I can try to scry 
on them.

4082
03:40:54,141 --> 03:40:56,502
I can try and scry on them and see, but 
that's going to take time.

4083
03:40:56,502 --> 03:40:57,960
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, now.

4084
03:40:57,960 --> 03:41:00,583
TALIESIN: One crisis at a time.

4085
03:41:00,583 --> 03:41:02,254
LIAM: We just start walking. Grog and I 
start walking.

4086
03:41:02,254 --> 03:41:04,388
TALIESIN: We start walking to the beach.

4087
03:41:04,388 --> 03:41:06,922
MARISHA: Can I scry while we're walking?

4088
03:41:06,922 --> 03:41:08,634
MATT: The ritual requires you--

4089
03:41:08,634 --> 03:41:09,791
TALIESIN: The ball.

4090
03:41:09,791 --> 03:41:10,965
LAURA: What about the ball?

4091
03:41:10,965 --> 03:41:14,765
MARISHA: Can I get a piggyback from Grog 
and scry while we're walking?

4092
03:41:14,765 --> 03:41:16,196
TALIESIN: On the carpet.

4093
03:41:16,196 --> 03:41:17,428
LAURA: Yeah, on the carpet.

4094
03:41:17,428 --> 03:41:19,226
MATT: You could probably try that.

4095
03:41:19,226 --> 03:41:21,806
I'd give you a concentration check to 
maintain it for the duration.

4096
03:41:21,806 --> 03:41:23,228
MARISHA: Let's do it, let's do it.

4097
03:41:23,228 --> 03:41:24,319
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a rest on 
the carpet

4098
03:41:24,319 --> 03:41:27,339
and I'm going to fly the carpet while you 
do your thing.

4099
03:41:27,339 --> 03:41:29,059
TRAVIS: Vax and I are still walking.

4100
03:41:29,059 --> 03:41:32,511
MARISHA: I'm going to cast-- I haven't burned 
any fifth-level spells, I'm going to scry.

4101
03:41:32,511 --> 03:41:34,504
MATT: Okay.

4102
03:41:34,504 --> 03:41:38,070
LAURA: Pike's going to cast healing on 
people.

4103
03:41:38,070 --> 03:41:41,390
MATT: Okay.

4104
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:45,722
TALIESIN: She might want to save-- well. 
We'll see. Seems like we know where--

4105
03:41:45,722 --> 03:41:47,879
MATT: Okay.

4106
03:41:47,879 --> 03:41:49,982
PATRICK: Whoever's low. I know some 
people are pretty low.

4107
03:41:49,982 --> 03:41:51,021
MARISHA: I'm really low.

4108
03:41:51,021 --> 03:41:53,273
LAURA: Everybody's low, super low.

4109
03:41:53,273 --> 03:41:54,925
MATT: You guys slowly make your way 
through the forest,

4110
03:41:54,925 --> 03:42:01,301
avoiding the patches that you noticed 
before, the weird collapsing earth.

4111
03:42:01,301 --> 03:42:09,610
MARISHA: I'm just laying back on the 
carpet in a trust-state as they guide me.

4112
03:42:09,610 --> 03:42:11,678
MATT: Go ahead and make a constitution 
saving throw, Keyleth.

4113
03:42:11,678 --> 03:42:12,887
MARISHA: Just straight constitution?

4114
03:42:12,887 --> 03:42:14,994
MATT: Yeah.

4115
03:42:14,994 --> 03:42:16,731
MARISHA: 15.

4116
03:42:16,731 --> 03:42:18,580
MATT: 15, okay.

4117
03:42:18,580 --> 03:42:20,354
MARISHA: No no no, 17. Plus five.

4118
03:42:20,354 --> 03:42:22,738
MATT: What are you focusing on?

4119
03:42:22,738 --> 03:42:23,931
MARISHA: Allura.

4120
03:42:23,931 --> 03:42:28,067
MATT: Allura? Okay.

4121
03:42:28,067 --> 03:42:33,871
MARISHA: Oh no. Oh no.

4122
03:42:33,871 --> 03:42:48,131
MATT: Okay. So. You focus on Allura's life 
force, form, face, and as you close your eyes,

4123
03:42:48,131 --> 03:42:54,663
slowly moving along with the gradual 
movement of the flying carpet,

4124
03:42:54,663 --> 03:43:01,934
your vision pulls out of you and above. 
An island.

4125
03:43:01,934 --> 03:43:09,720
It then shifts suddenly and pulls you 
over blue.

4126
03:43:09,720 --> 03:43:15,546
Over water. And then there's another flash, 
and there's nothing but water around you.

4127
03:43:15,546 --> 03:43:19,747
You don't know where you are, you don't
know where it is, and it flashes once more.

4128
03:43:19,747 --> 03:43:27,182
And there in the center of this open expanse 
of water and ocean, you see two figures swimming.

4129
03:43:27,182 --> 03:43:29,792
And you glance down and there in the 
middle of the ocean waters

4130
03:43:29,792 --> 03:43:35,956
you see Allura treading water, shouting 
Kima's name. "Kima!"

4131
03:43:35,956 --> 03:43:41,756
And looking across the way, you can just barely 
hear in the distance, "Allie, I'm coming!"

4132
03:43:41,756 --> 03:43:44,254
She swims over in that direction.

4133
03:43:44,254 --> 03:43:50,594
They eventually grab each other's hands 
and together hold each other and look around,

4134
03:43:50,594 --> 03:43:54,383
keeping treading water, as the sun is 
slowly beginning to set in the distance

4135
03:43:54,383 --> 03:43:56,874
and nightfall comes.

4136
03:43:56,874 --> 03:44:01,385
You just see Allura holding her there, 
trying to keep both aloft.

4137
03:44:01,385 --> 03:44:08,847
"It's all right. We're alive. I don't 
know where we are.

4138
03:44:08,847 --> 03:44:16,203
"But we'll figure this out. We'll figure 
this out."

4139
03:44:16,203 --> 03:44:20,196
And they both begin swimming, looking 
at the direction of the sun

4140
03:44:20,196 --> 03:44:23,250
and picking what looks to be a northern 
position. And then the scry--

4141
03:44:23,250 --> 03:44:25,644
MARISHA: Do I see any land, is there 
an island?

4142
03:44:25,644 --> 03:44:29,147
MATT: You cannot see-- the scrying is 
specifically on her.

4143
03:44:29,147 --> 03:44:33,482
But they are both just plopped somewhere 
in the ocean.

4144
03:44:33,482 --> 03:44:37,752
LAURA: If we would've gone through...

4145
03:44:37,752 --> 03:44:39,982
TALIESIN: We would've been in trouble.

4146
03:44:39,982 --> 03:44:40,749
LIAM: Drowning.

4147
03:44:40,749 --> 03:44:42,649
LAURA: Well no, we have the fucking magic 
carpet.

4148
03:44:42,649 --> 03:44:44,214
TALIESIN: That can't hold all of us.

4149
03:44:44,214 --> 03:44:46,268
LAURA: Oh my god.

4150
03:44:46,268 --> 03:44:53,023
MARISHA: I tell them what happened when 
I wake up. I don't even know where they could be.

4151
03:44:53,023 --> 03:44:54,648
They're in the middle of the ocean,

4152
03:44:54,648 --> 03:44:58,224
they could be right off the coast or 
hundreds of miles from here.

4153
03:44:58,224 --> 03:44:59,876
This ocean...

4154
03:44:59,876 --> 03:45:01,224
TALIESIN: This is fine.

4155
03:45:01,224 --> 03:45:03,300
We're going to go to Whitestone now, 
we're not going to go to Greyskull,

4156
03:45:03,300 --> 03:45:05,241
and we're going to get Gilmore's help.

4157
03:45:05,241 --> 03:45:06,492
LIAM: Gilmore, yes.

4158
03:45:06,492 --> 03:45:08,446
MARISHA: But they're our friends, are we 
just going to leave them behind?

4159
03:45:08,446 --> 03:45:10,314
TALIESIN: We're going to get Gilmore's 
help.

4160
03:45:10,314 --> 03:45:11,803
TRAVIS: One thing at a time.

4161
03:45:11,803 --> 03:45:13,571
LIAM: That's right. That's right.

4162
03:45:13,571 --> 03:45:19,153
MARISHA: I mean. Keyleth starts 
hyperventilating, panicking a little bit.

4163
03:45:19,153 --> 03:45:22,465
LAURA: Keyleth. We need you right now.

4164
03:45:22,465 --> 03:45:25,140
MARISHA: They're okay, right? Allura will 
figure it out, right?

4165
03:45:25,140 --> 03:45:27,701
LAURA: She'll figure it out. She's so 
powerful.

4166
03:45:27,701 --> 03:45:29,044
LIAM: Yeah.

4167
03:45:29,044 --> 03:45:30,195
MARISHA: Okay.

4168
03:45:30,195 --> 03:45:32,407
LIAM: One thing at a time.

4169
03:45:32,407 --> 03:45:38,543
MARISHA: This is taking everything to not 
stay here. Okay.

4170
03:45:38,543 --> 03:45:42,423
TRAVIS: Still moving towards the beach, 
looking for live trees.

4171
03:45:42,423 --> 03:45:45,435
MATT: A short time later, you eventually 
get close to the edge of the waterline,

4172
03:45:45,435 --> 03:45:49,499
and you do find a handful of trees 
that appear to be

4173
03:45:49,499 --> 03:45:55,097
alive enough and large enough to maintain 
one of your spells.

4174
03:45:55,097 --> 03:46:01,710
MARISHA: I do a useless scan of the ocean 
out of desperation to see if I see anything.

4175
03:46:01,710 --> 03:46:03,570
MATT: Perception check.

4176
03:46:03,570 --> 03:46:04,858
TALIESIN: I'll join.

4177
03:46:04,858 --> 03:46:07,464
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4178
03:46:07,464 --> 03:46:08,988
MARISHA: Natural 20.

4179
03:46:08,988 --> 03:46:10,784
LAURA: (gasps)

4180
03:46:10,784 --> 03:46:14,792
MARISHA: It's true. It was a Gil dice, it 
was Gil's dice. You can see, you can see.

4181
03:46:14,792 --> 03:46:17,622
MATT: And add your perception bonus?

4182
03:46:17,622 --> 03:46:19,347
MARISHA: 31.

4183
03:46:19,347 --> 03:46:20,442
MATT: 31.

4184
03:46:20,442 --> 03:46:25,310
MARISHA: Perception's 11.

4185
03:46:25,310 --> 03:46:29,804
MATT: You take a moment, and you don't 
know if it's the sense of the scry spell

4186
03:46:29,804 --> 03:46:32,798
and something about the arcane winds that 
blow through the ley lines of magic

4187
03:46:32,798 --> 03:46:39,828
that traverse across Exandria, but 
something guides your attention that way,

4188
03:46:39,828 --> 03:46:42,505
and you focus real hard,

4189
03:46:42,505 --> 03:46:48,494
and you see just at the horizon what looks 
to be a very, very faint speck of movement.

4190
03:46:48,494 --> 03:46:52,005
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.

4191
03:46:52,005 --> 03:46:54,989
MARISHA: There they are! Oh, shit--

4192
03:46:54,989 --> 03:46:56,126
LAURA: I take off on the broom.

4193
03:46:56,126 --> 03:46:58,012
MARISHA: I don't know if that's them, 
I think that's them!

4194
03:46:58,012 --> 03:46:59,460
TALIESIN: No, wait.

4195
03:46:59,460 --> 03:47:02,515
PATRICK: Kerrek puts his hand on her 
shoulder and says, "Oh, child."

4196
03:47:02,515 --> 03:47:04,809
LAURA: I take off on the broom, I'm out. 
In the direction that she went.

4197
03:47:04,809 --> 03:47:07,203
PATRICK: Wishing doesn't make it so.

4198
03:47:07,203 --> 03:47:09,643
MARISHA: No, I know. I know, but look! 
Look! There's something.

4199
03:47:09,643 --> 03:47:11,854
It could be something else, but it's 
something.

4200
03:47:11,854 --> 03:47:13,059
TALIESIN: Keyleth--

4201
03:47:13,059 --> 03:47:16,205
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going, I'm going. I went.

4202
03:47:16,205 --> 03:47:18,849
MATT: You, arcing as fast as you can on 
the broom,

4203
03:47:18,849 --> 03:47:21,238
full speed, holding on to the hat as best 
you can.

4204
03:47:21,238 --> 03:47:24,277
The wind of the ocean air coming past 
your face,

4205
03:47:24,277 --> 03:47:30,563
the salt and the briny spray of bits of 
reef and rock that surround the island--

4206
03:47:30,563 --> 03:47:33,014
MARISHA: I'm trying to give Vex over the 
earpiece like a,

4207
03:47:33,014 --> 03:47:39,593
Warmer, warmer, warmer, colder, a 
little-- ten degrees to your left.

4208
03:47:39,593 --> 03:47:50,519
MATT: Yeah, you do look out and you see both Kima 
and Allura swimming through the ocean, exhausted

4209
03:47:50,519 --> 03:47:54,548
and it looks like, based on both the
heavy armor

4210
03:47:54,548 --> 03:47:56,921
that Kima's wearing and their general 
physical state,

4211
03:47:56,921 --> 03:48:01,846
they're both having a hard time treading water, 
and they're swimming in the wrong direction.

4212
03:48:01,846 --> 03:48:06,048
LAURA: I fly over them and just tell 
them, "Hang onto the broom!"

4213
03:48:06,048 --> 03:48:12,935
MATT: "Oh, that's the best thing I 
could've hoped for seeing."

4214
03:48:12,935 --> 03:48:18,345
And Allura reaches up and grabs your arm 
and says, "Kima, hold on!" And grabs the edge.

4215
03:48:18,345 --> 03:48:27,646
You can see Kima now is like coughing up water 
and is trying desperately to tread water.

4216
03:48:27,646 --> 03:48:34,857
That's a natural 20 on a strength check 
for Allura. Holy shit. With no modifier.

4217
03:48:34,857 --> 03:48:38,781
Manages to hold onto both you and 
Kima and keep you up.

4218
03:48:38,781 --> 03:48:48,695
I need you to make an athletics check. 
Just to hold on.

4219
03:48:48,695 --> 03:48:50,228
LAURA: 13?

4220
03:48:50,228 --> 03:48:53,128
MATT: 13, okay. It's enough to maintain.

4221
03:48:53,128 --> 03:48:56,873
Carrying them both back as fast as the 
broom-- which is not very fast at this time.

4222
03:48:56,873 --> 03:49:00,228
It takes you probably a good 15 or 
so minutes,

4223
03:49:00,228 --> 03:49:04,207
and as the tension's going on you can see 
Allura getting more and more exhausted.

4224
03:49:04,207 --> 03:49:06,509
LAURA: Keep holding, we're almost there, 
darling.

4225
03:49:06,509 --> 03:49:08,370
MATT: I'm trying.

4226
03:49:08,370 --> 03:49:10,972
MARISHA: I just keep saying, "Vex? 
Did you find them?"

4227
03:49:10,972 --> 03:49:12,658
TALIESIN: I'm taking the carpet that 
direction.

4228
03:49:12,658 --> 03:49:13,825
MARISHA: Vex?

4229
03:49:13,825 --> 03:49:19,085
PATRICK: If it's been this long, Kerrek 
has given The Talk, like.

4230
03:49:19,085 --> 03:49:23,652
MARISHA: I'm just crying in Kerrek's 
shoulder right now, just bawling my eyes out.

4231
03:49:23,652 --> 03:49:28,705
TALIESIN: "I'll be back in a moment." I'm taking 
the carpet towards the speck I see on the--

4232
03:49:28,705 --> 03:49:31,062
and probably ten minutes in is where, I 
would have given it ten minutes.

4233
03:49:31,062 --> 03:49:32,550
I'm on the way with the carpet.

4234
03:49:32,550 --> 03:49:33,605
LAURA: I have them.

4235
03:49:33,605 --> 03:49:34,871
MARISHA: I swear I saw them, I swear.

4236
03:49:34,871 --> 03:49:38,096
MATT: At this point, you can see Allura's 
grip is getting shaky on the broom now.

4237
03:49:38,096 --> 03:49:43,925
She says, "We're almost close enough. 
Now." And then her and Kima vanish

4238
03:49:43,925 --> 03:49:50,730
in a puff of dark bluish energy and appear on 
the carpet next to you through dimension door.

4239
03:49:50,730 --> 03:49:56,497
TALIESIN: (yelps) I'm so tired.

4240
03:49:56,497 --> 03:49:59,779
MARISHA: Still sobbing into Kerrek's 
shoulder.

4241
03:49:59,779 --> 03:50:04,676
PATRICK: It's been a slow litany of, sometimes 
people go and you never get them back.

4242
03:50:04,676 --> 03:50:08,207
It's, he's giving you the wrong pep talk.

4243
03:50:08,207 --> 03:50:15,070
MARISHA: Oh god. So wait, maybe they were 
just dead and I saw their ghosts?

4244
03:50:15,070 --> 03:50:16,998
LAURA: We have them! We have them!

4245
03:50:16,998 --> 03:50:20,589
MARISHA: What? And I just cry harder.

4246
03:50:20,589 --> 03:50:26,441
LIAM: Vax is also listening to that, sometimes 
you cannot get them back, while holding Scanlan.

4247
03:50:26,441 --> 03:50:30,996
LAURA: (wailing) Like little Dobby in 
Harry Potter.

4248
03:50:30,996 --> 03:50:35,475
MATT: Eventually you guys manage to gather 
the rest of your party at the beachside.

4249
03:50:35,475 --> 03:50:43,560
Waterlogged, Kima shakes it out, leaving this 
trail as her hair's all matted and into her face,

4250
03:50:43,560 --> 03:50:53,616
and she just looks really pissed and is 
like, "Not a word."

4251
03:50:53,616 --> 03:50:58,168
Allura's squeezing out the sides of her 
braids. "Well, now what?"

4252
03:50:58,168 --> 03:51:01,857
LAURA: Whitestone.

4253
03:51:01,857 --> 03:51:05,934
MARISHA: Let's take a tree, shall we?

4254
03:51:05,934 --> 03:51:08,855
MATT: Let's try. I think this definitely 
explains why so many folks

4255
03:51:08,855 --> 03:51:13,006
who went to investigate this place 
never came back.

4256
03:51:13,006 --> 03:51:16,721
PATRICK: Are we as far away as we can be, 
like, we came in on a tree, right?

4257
03:51:16,721 --> 03:51:17,543
TRAVIS: We're on the beach.

4258
03:51:17,543 --> 03:51:18,430
MATT: You came in on a tree, yes.

4259
03:51:18,430 --> 03:51:19,388
PATRICK: Okay.

4260
03:51:19,388 --> 03:51:21,991
TALIESIN: That doesn't mean a lot, but 
yeah. We're as far as we can get.

4261
03:51:21,991 --> 03:51:26,452
MATT: So you go ahead and find the tree? 
All right. Hm.

4262
03:51:26,452 --> 03:51:28,758
As you reach out and touch the side
of the tree,

4263
03:51:28,758 --> 03:51:32,066
eyes clenched tight, hoping that 
this is enough,

4264
03:51:32,066 --> 03:51:35,780
you watch as the bark splits into

4265
03:51:35,780 --> 03:51:40,749
the transportation via plants portal, 
and as it splits apart,

4266
03:51:40,749 --> 03:51:45,931
you can see further internal wood 
striations, those split.

4267
03:51:45,931 --> 03:51:50,865
A third layer splits, it's having to force
its way through this tree,

4268
03:51:50,865 --> 03:52:00,955
and finally it divides out and you can see the 
sunset-lit outside of the center of Whitestone.

4269
03:52:00,955 --> 03:52:02,495
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

4270
03:52:02,495 --> 03:52:08,212
MARISHA: I hold the door open like it's a closing 
elevator. Am I sure it's fucking Whitestone?

4271
03:52:08,212 --> 03:52:09,951
MATT: It appears to be Whitestone.

4272
03:52:09,951 --> 03:52:10,724
LAURA: We've got six seconds, go!

4273
03:52:10,724 --> 03:52:11,370
MARISHA: Go!

4274
03:52:11,370 --> 03:52:12,176
TALIESIN: I'm running for it.

4275
03:52:12,176 --> 03:52:14,846
MATT: You guys all charge through, 
making your way through the portal.

4276
03:52:14,846 --> 03:52:17,071
MARISHA: And I go in last.

4277
03:52:17,071 --> 03:52:21,113
MATT: You all step out, catching yourself, 
just as the tree slams behind you.

4278
03:52:21,113 --> 03:52:26,139
There you see the faintly blossoming 
branches of the Sun Tree

4279
03:52:26,139 --> 03:52:32,867
greeting you to the center of sunsetting 
Whitestone, together as a group,

4280
03:52:32,867 --> 03:52:40,708
clutching Scanlan's lifeless body in your 
arms still, Vax. What do you do?

4281
03:52:40,708 --> 03:52:43,809
MARISHA: I cry to Kerr a little bit more.

4282
03:52:43,809 --> 03:52:45,520
TRAVIS: No, no time for that.

4283
03:52:45,520 --> 03:52:46,356
TALIESIN: No time.

4284
03:52:46,356 --> 03:52:47,045
LAURA: Get him to the castle.

4285
03:52:47,045 --> 03:52:48,045
MARISHA: Okay, sorry.

4286
03:52:48,045 --> 03:52:48,937
LAURA: Right?

4287
03:52:48,937 --> 03:52:50,603
MARISHA: No, should we get him to the 
castle or the Raven Queen's temple?

4288
03:52:50,603 --> 03:52:52,447
LIAM: To the temple of the Raven Queen.

4289
03:52:52,447 --> 03:52:53,605
MARISHA: Okay, to the temple, to
the temple.

4290
03:52:53,605 --> 03:52:55,778
TALIESIN: Scry-- find his daughter. 
Scry on his daughter.

4291
03:52:55,778 --> 03:53:01,258
MARISHA: Okay. I use my-- oh jeez. I can't
remember--

4292
03:53:01,258 --> 03:53:04,052
no, I didn't use any of my Scrying Eye on
Raishan at all, right?

4293
03:53:04,052 --> 03:53:05,133
TALIESIN: No.

4294
03:53:05,133 --> 03:53:09,279
MARISHA: That was my spell just now. I will use 
my Scrying Eye now to see if I can find Kaylie.

4295
03:53:09,279 --> 03:53:11,229
LIAM: I'm already 50 feet towards the 
temple.

4296
03:53:11,229 --> 03:53:13,245
MATT: Okay. You guys all make your way 
towards the temple of the Raven Queen

4297
03:53:13,245 --> 03:53:19,797
and the graveyard outside of Whitestone. As 
you're making this scry attempt with the item,

4298
03:53:19,797 --> 03:53:28,333
go ahead and make another concentration check as 
you're moving along and doing this on the carpet.

4299
03:53:28,333 --> 03:53:33,732
MARISHA: That's cocked. That's not bad. 
Just a regular-- what do I use?

4300
03:53:33,732 --> 03:53:35,707
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw.

4301
03:53:35,707 --> 03:53:38,132
MARISHA: Con saving throw? Then 16.

4302
03:53:38,132 --> 03:53:41,593
MATT: Remember, you have warcaster, so you 
technically have advantage on concentration, too.

4303
03:53:41,593 --> 03:53:43,471
MARISHA: Oh my god, oh my god.

4304
03:53:43,471 --> 03:53:44,393
MATT: Don't forget that.

4305
03:53:44,393 --> 03:53:45,490
MARISHA: No, 16.

4306
03:53:45,490 --> 03:53:50,231
MATT: Okay. Little bit of a show. Okay. 
Your vision pulls back

4307
03:53:50,231 --> 03:53:54,630
and is dragged fast enough through the 
clouds to have no sense of direction.

4308
03:53:54,630 --> 03:53:58,227
Suddenly you feel your essence thrust 
downward through the clouds once more

4309
03:53:58,227 --> 03:54:04,557
towards the closing daylight around Kymal 
in the center of Tal'Dorei.

4310
03:54:04,557 --> 03:54:06,220
MARISHA: She's in Kymal.

4311
03:54:06,220 --> 03:54:12,813
MATT: Looking down to the rather dirty, 
destitute,

4312
03:54:12,813 --> 03:54:20,558
gambling-overrun and light-law-enforced 
city that Kymal is,

4313
03:54:20,558 --> 03:54:25,555
you're pulled once more into what looks 
to be a tavern room,

4314
03:54:25,555 --> 03:54:31,327
and there you see a makeshift band of 
very terrible performers playing,

4315
03:54:31,327 --> 03:54:37,833
and at the back table you see Kaylie with 
half a flagon of ale sitting there,

4316
03:54:37,833 --> 03:54:43,245
dagger on the table, just staring and just 
giving those performers shit, she's like,

4317
03:54:43,245 --> 03:54:48,940
"You all fucking suck, you know that?"

4318
03:54:48,940 --> 03:54:51,002
MARISHA: Oh, I love her so much right now.

4319
03:54:51,002 --> 03:54:56,287
MATT: Where I come from, they'd kill you 
for this. That's terrible. Certainly.

4320
03:54:56,287 --> 03:55:02,110
MARISHA: Knowing how scrying works, and knowing 
that certain magic-casters can feel it--

4321
03:55:02,110 --> 03:55:07,989
This is going on a limb. I just yell through 
the scrying and audibly amongst everyone,

4322
03:55:07,989 --> 03:55:14,034
"Kaylie! It's Scanlan!"

4323
03:55:14,034 --> 03:55:19,851
Trying to push through the magical boundary and 
see if I can at least get a reaction out of her.

4324
03:55:19,851 --> 03:55:23,342
MATT: Okay. You're shouting this, you 
guys hear her doing this,

4325
03:55:23,342 --> 03:55:26,484
and you just keep pushing forward, 
occasionally checking to make sure she's okay.

4326
03:55:26,484 --> 03:55:30,220
Kaylie just keeps drinking from the 
flagon and is shouting out,

4327
03:55:30,220 --> 03:55:36,142
someone comes by and you watch as she deftly 
nabs a little bit of coin from the pocket--

4328
03:55:36,142 --> 03:55:38,819
MARISHA: And I scream again, "Kaylie!"

4329
03:55:38,819 --> 03:55:40,745
MATT: Doesn't seem to be having an effect.

4330
03:55:40,745 --> 03:55:42,101
TALIESIN: Kymal.

4331
03:55:42,101 --> 03:55:47,417
MARISHA: God damn it, I wish you could 
talk to people through scrying sometimes.

4332
03:55:47,417 --> 03:55:48,929
LAURA: Who can send me there?

4333
03:55:48,929 --> 03:55:50,123
MARISHA: She's in Kymal.

4334
03:55:50,123 --> 03:55:52,278
LAURA: Who can send me there? I'll go.

4335
03:55:52,278 --> 03:55:54,309
MARISHA: Allura might be able to send 
her a message.

4336
03:55:54,309 --> 03:55:56,850
Allura, do you still have any messages 
left?

4337
03:55:56,850 --> 03:55:59,266
MATT: I can cast Sending, yes.

4338
03:55:59,266 --> 03:56:02,714
MARISHA: Has she ever met Kaylie?

4339
03:56:02,714 --> 03:56:04,091
LAURA: I don't think so.

4340
03:56:04,091 --> 03:56:04,942
LIAM: No.

4341
03:56:04,942 --> 03:56:06,680
LAURA: We need to get her and bring 
her here.

4342
03:56:06,680 --> 03:56:08,490
LIAM: Can we get the other gate stone 
and find Shaun.

4343
03:56:08,490 --> 03:56:09,934
LAURA: I've got the gate stone, yes.

4344
03:56:09,934 --> 03:56:11,302
LIAM: We have both of them, we have them?

4345
03:56:11,302 --> 03:56:12,479
TALIESIN: No, we have the one gate stone.

4346
03:56:12,479 --> 03:56:13,472
LIAM: Yeah, doesn't your sister have 
the other one?

4347
03:56:13,472 --> 03:56:14,703
TALIESIN: She has the other one.

4348
03:56:14,703 --> 03:56:16,407
LIAM: Yes, find the other gate stone and 
find Shaun.

4349
03:56:16,407 --> 03:56:17,909
LAURA: Find the other gate stone. I take 
off to find Gilmore.

4350
03:56:17,909 --> 03:56:19,511
MATT: Okay.

4351
03:56:19,511 --> 03:56:20,602
TALIESIN: I will go get the other gate
stone.

4352
03:56:20,602 --> 03:56:22,938
MARISHA: I'm tapped out of teleportations.

4353
03:56:22,938 --> 03:56:24,997
TALIESIN: It's fine. We can make this 
work.

4354
03:56:24,997 --> 03:56:28,803
And in the meantime, take him to the 
Raven Queen temple.

4355
03:56:28,803 --> 03:56:32,484
MATT: And so is Allura.

4356
03:56:32,484 --> 03:56:33,555
MARISHA: Tapped out of teleportation?

4357
03:56:33,555 --> 03:56:36,165
MATT: Yeah.

4358
03:56:36,165 --> 03:56:38,624
PATRICK: Now, from what I know about the
Raven Queen,

4359
03:56:38,624 --> 03:56:42,066
she is not like, oh, you can get a 
do-over, right?

4360
03:56:42,066 --> 03:56:43,070
LAURA: No.

4361
03:56:43,070 --> 03:56:46,787
PATRICK: She is like, you are dead and that is 
the line you do not cross to not come back.

4362
03:56:46,787 --> 03:56:48,230
LIAM: It's a little more complicated.

4363
03:56:48,230 --> 03:56:49,857
LAURA: Well, he is her champion.

4364
03:56:49,857 --> 03:56:51,584
PATRICK: Yeah, but from what I know.

4365
03:56:51,584 --> 03:56:56,146
MATT: From what you know as Kerrek? 
Yeah, she's--

4366
03:56:56,146 --> 03:57:00,532
PATRICK: She's the one that fucking holds 
this line. Like, you do not come back.

4367
03:57:00,532 --> 03:57:02,375
MATT: She guides you. One way or the 
other.

4368
03:57:02,375 --> 03:57:10,283
She's the mistress of fate, and if your 
destiny is cut short, there is exception.

4369
03:57:10,283 --> 03:57:13,640
PATRICK: Okay, okay.

4370
03:57:13,640 --> 03:57:21,910
MATT: However, her real loathing is for those 
people who go against that natural destiny.

4371
03:57:21,910 --> 03:57:23,780
PATRICK: That abrogate the natural order.

4372
03:57:23,780 --> 03:57:24,704
MATT: Exactly.

4373
03:57:24,704 --> 03:57:26,376
PATRICK: Okay, right.

4374
03:57:26,376 --> 03:57:35,037
MATT: Unnatural, unexpected death across one's 
fate line is unfortunate, but it can be corrected.

4375
03:57:35,037 --> 03:57:39,888
PATRICK: Okay, okay.

4376
03:57:39,888 --> 03:57:42,505
MATT: So. You go ahead and you look for 
Gilmore?

4377
03:57:42,505 --> 03:57:47,093
You find Gilmore with a big mug of coffee 
in his comfort robes,

4378
03:57:47,093 --> 03:57:50,134
still recovering from the war the 
previous day,

4379
03:57:50,134 --> 03:57:54,067
his hair's tousled up and he's sitting 
there cradling it,

4380
03:57:54,067 --> 03:57:56,347
looking out as the sun's setting in the

4381
03:57:56,347 --> 03:58:00,451
main common mess area of the castle, 
and as you walk in.

4382
03:58:00,451 --> 03:58:03,016
"Oh, Vex'ahlia, you return!"

4383
03:58:03,016 --> 03:58:04,863
LAURA: I just run straight up. "Darling."

4384
03:58:04,863 --> 03:58:06,033
MATT: Yes, yes?

4385
03:58:06,033 --> 03:58:08,957
LAURA: Do you have teleportation? Do you have 
anything that can send me to Kymal. Kymal?

4386
03:58:08,957 --> 03:58:09,561
LIAM: Kymal.

4387
03:58:09,561 --> 03:58:10,592
LAURA: To Kymal.

4388
03:58:10,592 --> 03:58:12,003
MARISHA: In a tavern in Kymal.

4389
03:58:12,003 --> 03:58:13,827
MATT: I-- (nervous chuckle)

4390
03:58:13,827 --> 03:58:15,219
LAURA: Please.

4391
03:58:15,219 --> 03:58:22,932
MATT: I don't know of a sigil there, I'm sorry. 
I normally don't frequent places like that.

4392
03:58:22,932 --> 03:58:31,118
It's a bit dastardly for my tastes. I-- 
I'm sorry.

4393
03:58:31,118 --> 03:58:37,957
LAURA: (tearfully) Do you know of a city 
nearby? Anything?

4394
03:58:37,957 --> 03:58:54,303
MATT: I mean, there's Westruun, but that 
sigil got destroyed too. What's wrong?

4395
03:58:54,303 --> 03:59:06,353
LAURA: (tearfully) I don't know what to do. 
Scanlan's down. We have to find his daughter.

4396
03:59:06,353 --> 03:59:15,768
MATT: Puts his mug down and stands up slowly. 
His demeanor gets very stoic and very dark.

4397
03:59:15,768 --> 03:59:28,526
"Well. Let's see what we can do. Follow 
me."

4398
03:59:28,526 --> 03:59:31,869
And he begins walking down and leads you

4399
03:59:31,869 --> 03:59:36,237
towards the home that he's been staying 
here in Whitestone.

4400
03:59:36,237 --> 03:59:41,204
He goes in, and it's barely furnished 
based on the original attack on Whitestone

4401
03:59:41,204 --> 03:59:44,433
when you guys had the assassins that 
came after you here.

4402
03:59:44,433 --> 03:59:46,854
It's been cleaned up but it hasn't been 
replaced.

4403
03:59:46,854 --> 03:59:50,617
He goes rummaging through some things up in 
his room, he goes through a few bags and goes,

4404
03:59:50,617 --> 04:00:02,047
"I don't really have many options. 
Is it a--"

4405
04:00:02,047 --> 04:00:12,305
LAURA: I just need to get there.

4406
04:00:12,305 --> 04:00:14,427
MATT: Have you talked to Allura?

4407
04:00:14,427 --> 04:00:26,827
LAURA: She's out. Out of spells.

4408
04:00:26,827 --> 04:00:36,530
MATT: "Hold on." And he leads you back up 
to the castle. What are you guys doing?

4409
04:00:36,530 --> 04:00:41,716
LIAM: All this time, I have laid Scanlan 
down in the center of the temple,

4410
04:00:41,716 --> 04:00:44,657
and with a wet rag I have cleaned his face
and

4411
04:00:44,657 --> 04:00:49,429
combed his hair out and laid Mythcarver 
out next to him.

4412
04:00:49,429 --> 04:00:52,818
LAURA: Probably gave him some clean pants 
because he's covered in piss.

4413
04:00:52,818 --> 04:00:53,892
MARISHA: Yeah.

4414
04:00:53,892 --> 04:00:55,514
MATT: Yeah, you've got to scrub that 
down a little.

4415
04:00:55,514 --> 04:00:59,083
TRAVIS: I'm waiting outside the temple 
because I probably can't go in.

4416
04:00:59,083 --> 04:01:01,354
Right? I can't go in there.

4417
04:01:01,354 --> 04:01:02,124
LAURA: Why?

4418
04:01:02,124 --> 04:01:05,550
TRAVIS: I don't know. I'm just me.

4419
04:01:05,550 --> 04:01:11,380
LIAM: While I'm cleaning, I start talking 
as well.

4420
04:01:11,380 --> 04:01:22,365
You know, if it is his time, then I can 
accept that it is his time.

4421
04:01:22,365 --> 04:01:33,666
But he just did an awful lot for you. 
That dragon was tampering with your ways,

4422
04:01:33,666 --> 04:01:36,784
and without him we would have not 
gotten as far as we have.

4423
04:01:36,784 --> 04:01:40,731
He has done a lot for you, and this isn't 
even bargaining anymore.

4424
04:01:40,731 --> 04:01:47,629
I am yours. I'm not bargaining.

4425
04:01:47,629 --> 04:01:56,925
But this little man has more heart in his 
chest than any man I've met.

4426
04:01:56,925 --> 04:02:04,527
And if there is anyone who deserves 
a second chance...

4427
04:02:04,527 --> 04:02:11,302
I don't know, I don't know. Your will be 
done.

4428
04:02:11,302 --> 04:02:16,036
MARISHA: I grab Grog on the outside of 
the temple, also standing outside,

4429
04:02:16,036 --> 04:02:23,549
and I just grab him by his massive 
gigantic shoulder and say,

4430
04:02:23,549 --> 04:02:29,013
You were closer to him than probably 
anyone else in this group,

4431
04:02:29,013 --> 04:02:31,695
you knew more of his secrets than 
anyone else.

4432
04:02:31,695 --> 04:02:38,807
I think it would mean something if you 
talked to him from beyond.

4433
04:02:38,807 --> 04:02:42,148
TRAVIS: How do I do that?

4434
04:02:42,148 --> 04:02:50,935
MARISHA: His spirit still holds on. You can still 
speak to his spirit and convince it to come back.

4435
04:02:50,935 --> 04:03:02,223
Convince it to come back, Grog. You knew him. 
You knew him. Look inside and you will know.

4436
04:03:02,223 --> 04:03:06,944
TRAVIS: What, I just start talking to him?

4437
04:03:06,944 --> 04:03:11,260
MARISHA: And I crack the door to the 
temple open and try and gesture him in.

4438
04:03:11,260 --> 04:03:18,853
TRAVIS: Oh, in there. I'm not really 
religious, though, like. I don't--

4439
04:03:18,853 --> 04:03:25,494
MARISHA: You don't have to be religious. You had 
the connection with Scanlan, and you have heart.

4440
04:03:25,494 --> 04:03:34,434
That connection speaks far stronger than 
any religion ever could. It's up to you.

4441
04:03:34,434 --> 04:03:37,102
We don't know if Kaylie will make it.

4442
04:03:37,102 --> 04:03:43,459
TRAVIS: Right. Okay. For Scanlan, then. 
And I go into the temple of the Raven Queen.

4443
04:03:43,459 --> 04:03:48,052
MATT: Okay. Are you guys having Pike prepare 
the Resurrection ritual, is that what's going on?

4444
04:03:48,052 --> 04:03:49,306
LAURA: I guess so.

4445
04:03:49,306 --> 04:03:52,437
MATT: I don't know what's happening. 
You guys are talking to air right now.

4446
04:03:52,437 --> 04:03:55,017
MARISHA: Well, I was talking to Grog.

4447
04:03:55,017 --> 04:03:56,566
MATT: Right, right, right.

4448
04:03:56,566 --> 04:03:58,265
TALIESIN: Trying to put together the 
Resurrection ritual.

4449
04:03:58,265 --> 04:03:59,561
MATT: Okay, that's what I thought.

4450
04:03:59,561 --> 04:04:00,527
LAURA: Trying to prepare that, yeah.

4451
04:04:00,527 --> 04:04:02,663
LIAM: I wasn't expecting-- that wasn't 
part of the ritual.

4452
04:04:02,663 --> 04:04:03,932
MATT: Right, right.

4453
04:04:03,932 --> 04:04:11,463
PATRICK: So everybody here is a mess, right? 
And when they brought them out of the ocean,

4454
04:04:11,463 --> 04:04:20,489
Kerrek was like-- because that shook him, 
you know? Because he knew at this point,

4455
04:04:20,489 --> 04:04:27,337
now is the point where all your friends die. But 
these guys I can't talk to, they are all messed--

4456
04:04:27,337 --> 04:04:28,769
how bad are you?

4457
04:04:28,769 --> 04:04:31,460
TALIESIN: Outwardly I'm fine.

4458
04:04:31,460 --> 04:04:32,345
PATRICK: Okay.

4459
04:04:32,345 --> 04:04:33,809
TALIESIN: I'm in get-shit-done mode.

4460
04:04:33,809 --> 04:04:36,951
PATRICK: Right. I get you a little aside.

4461
04:04:36,951 --> 04:04:41,192
TALIESIN: I'm probably coming back down 
now from the castle with the stone.

4462
04:04:41,192 --> 04:04:45,286
PATRICK: What-- can his sister do 
something, or his daughter?

4463
04:04:45,286 --> 04:04:47,368
TALIESIN: His daughter.

4464
04:04:47,368 --> 04:04:50,165
PATRICK: Why-- why the urgency, I mean?

4465
04:04:50,165 --> 04:04:52,929
TALIESIN: Because it's the only thing I 
can think of

4466
04:04:52,929 --> 04:04:58,600
that could really drag him back from
wherever he is.

4467
04:04:58,600 --> 04:05:02,487
That's my thought. I've been there, 
I've experienced this.

4468
04:05:02,487 --> 04:05:04,451
PATRICK: Been where?

4469
04:05:04,451 --> 04:05:17,067
TALIESIN: I've died. And you need to... 
it's not easy.

4470
04:05:17,067 --> 04:05:21,430
And you need to-- not everything cuts 
through.

4471
04:05:21,430 --> 04:05:26,738
You need to find the right thing to cut 
through, and I think this might be it.

4472
04:05:26,738 --> 04:05:31,766
So it's where I'm putting my bets.

4473
04:05:31,766 --> 04:05:36,721
MATT: Allura approaches and says,

4474
04:05:36,721 --> 04:05:45,139
"If we can wait until tomorrow, I can take 
us there, but-- I just, I have no means of--"

4475
04:05:45,139 --> 04:05:48,717
MARISHA: What about--

4476
04:05:48,717 --> 04:05:50,855
LAURA: I feel like it's bad to wait.

4477
04:05:50,855 --> 04:05:54,561
MARISHA: Oh jeez, I don't know his name.

4478
04:05:54,561 --> 04:05:59,502
MATT: Vex, as you're brought up to the 
castle, Gilmore is tugging your arm,

4479
04:05:59,502 --> 04:06:03,130
and you see he has a haste to him, 
and he's like,

4480
04:06:03,130 --> 04:06:10,971
"Where's Eskil? Where's Eskil? Has he returned? 
Please, somebody, give me this answer. Anyone."

4481
04:06:10,971 --> 04:06:13,789
And you watch as some of the guards come 
up and like,

4482
04:06:13,789 --> 04:06:22,807
"Eskil's been back in his research at the 
ziggurat for the better part of a week, now."

4483
04:06:22,807 --> 04:06:24,100
TALIESIN: Guards, you're with Gilmore,

4484
04:06:24,100 --> 04:06:27,260
you will get him into any room in the 
castle immediately without question.

4485
04:06:27,260 --> 04:06:28,501
MATT: Yes sir, yes sir.

4486
04:06:28,501 --> 04:06:30,974
TALIESIN: Now.

4487
04:06:30,974 --> 04:06:35,919
MATT: Pulls you down, and you rush down 
past the Ziggurat,

4488
04:06:35,919 --> 04:06:41,059
and Eskil's returning with his servant.

4489
04:06:41,059 --> 04:06:45,788
This older hunched form. It looks like 
they finished their work for the day and,

4490
04:06:45,788 --> 04:06:49,596
as you all begin rushing down the hall to 
the ziggurat beneath Whitestone, he says,

4491
04:06:49,596 --> 04:06:54,264
"Oh, hello. We're finished, there's no 
reason to--"

4492
04:06:54,264 --> 04:06:56,199
LAURA: Teleportation.

4493
04:06:56,199 --> 04:06:58,267
MATT: It's a very strange, very--

4494
04:06:58,267 --> 04:06:59,942
LAURA: Shaun.

4495
04:06:59,942 --> 04:07:01,934
MATT: -- unique magic, yes, of course.

4496
04:07:01,934 --> 04:07:04,347
LAURA: Can you do it?

4497
04:07:04,347 --> 04:07:06,982
MATT: Peh. Child's play, really.

4498
04:07:06,982 --> 04:07:09,228
LAURA: Then can you send me to Kymal, 
please?

4499
04:07:09,228 --> 04:07:10,299
MATT: Kymal?

4500
04:07:10,299 --> 04:07:10,979
LAURA: Yes.

4501
04:07:10,979 --> 04:07:11,937
MATT: Why would you want to--

4502
04:07:11,937 --> 04:07:13,973
LAURA: Urgently, darling.

4503
04:07:13,973 --> 04:07:14,749
MATT: "Shaun--"

4504
04:07:14,749 --> 04:07:16,438
Shaun kind of goes,

4505
04:07:16,438 --> 04:07:20,459
"If you want to be of use to anybody right 
now, buddy, this is the way to do it."

4506
04:07:20,459 --> 04:07:31,553
(sputters) "Kymal. All right. Heh, that's a one-
way trip, so you're paying for room and board."

4507
04:07:31,553 --> 04:07:35,597
LAURA: "Sure." I give Shaun a kiss on 
the cheek.

4508
04:07:35,597 --> 04:07:39,595
MATT: All right. Have you guys caught 
up at this point?

4509
04:07:39,595 --> 04:07:45,512
TALIESIN: I'm at the temple, I've sent 
them off to deal with this.

4510
04:07:45,512 --> 04:07:51,249
MATT: All right. So we go-- what are 
you looking for?

4511
04:07:51,249 --> 04:07:54,490
LAURA: I'm looking for a tavern, probably 
the only one in town.

4512
04:07:54,490 --> 04:07:56,579
MATT: All right, I'll take you there, and 
that's where we're staying for the night.

4513
04:07:56,579 --> 04:07:58,455
We'll return tomorrow.

4514
04:07:58,455 --> 04:08:01,001
LAURA: Yes.

4515
04:08:01,001 --> 04:08:06,332
MATT: "All right. (sighs) It's been a 
while."

4516
04:08:06,332 --> 04:08:08,894
And he reaches out and grabs your hand.

4517
04:08:08,894 --> 04:08:16,007
"Be back in a day!" And begins doing this 
incantation.

4518
04:08:16,007 --> 04:08:19,041
As he traces his fingers through the air, 
you watch these lines begin to connect,

4519
04:08:19,041 --> 04:08:23,200
and he's tracing almost this mystical 
map of the portions of Tal'Dorei,

4520
04:08:23,200 --> 04:08:25,718
and as each finger hits a point you see 
him connect a thread.

4521
04:08:25,718 --> 04:08:28,366
As he connects a thread, both of you 
blink out

4522
04:08:28,366 --> 04:08:30,999
and appear in the middle of this busy 
cobblestone street.

4523
04:08:30,999 --> 04:08:35,853
You can hear what sounds like raucous 
laughter and shouting in the distance

4524
04:08:35,853 --> 04:08:37,924
from two different directions.

4525
04:08:37,924 --> 04:08:42,381
You can see now as the night has gone 
from a bright orange and purple

4526
04:08:42,381 --> 04:08:46,589
to the dark reds and blues of post-sunset.

4527
04:08:46,589 --> 04:08:52,950
There are a couple of what look to be 
guards wandering the street,

4528
04:08:52,950 --> 04:08:57,443
but they themselves look to be laughing and 
probably a little tipsy in their own right.

4529
04:08:57,443 --> 04:09:02,808
You see many humans, and you see a 
couple of half-orcs.

4530
04:09:02,808 --> 04:09:05,891
You actually see two gnolls and what 
looks to be a goblin

4531
04:09:05,891 --> 04:09:08,026
that are wandering amongst those 
people in the street.

4532
04:09:08,026 --> 04:09:15,591
Kymal is, and you've passed through 
before. Kymal is-- it's the real--

4533
04:09:15,591 --> 04:09:20,617
it's the seedy Reno of Tal'Dorei, 
if you will.

4534
04:09:20,617 --> 04:09:24,924
MARISHA: I mean, Reno's already 
pretty seedy, so.

4535
04:09:24,924 --> 04:09:29,926
MATT: It's not Laughlin level. It's not-- 
sorry, Laughlin.

4536
04:09:29,926 --> 04:09:32,735
MARISHA: Sorry, Reno.

4537
04:09:32,735 --> 04:09:37,352
MATT: Go ahead and make an 
investigation check.

4538
04:09:37,352 --> 04:09:40,044
LAURA: I'm just terrified of all my dice.

4539
04:09:40,044 --> 04:09:43,640
LIAM: High rolls.

4540
04:09:43,640 --> 04:09:45,193
LAURA: 16?

4541
04:09:45,193 --> 04:09:46,643
MATT: 16, okay.

4542
04:09:46,643 --> 04:09:53,316
LAURA: Wait, but I didn't add anything to 
that. Investigation... that's a 23.

4543
04:09:53,316 --> 04:09:56,862
MATT: Okay, yeah. Asking questions rapidly 
around, dragging Eskil behind, he's like,

4544
04:09:56,862 --> 04:10:00,659
"Where are we going? (grumbling)"

4545
04:10:00,659 --> 04:10:08,219
Asking to where the worst performers 
you've seen perform in this town,

4546
04:10:08,219 --> 04:10:11,353
and everyone keeps pointing you to this 
one place that's up on this one hill

4547
04:10:11,353 --> 04:10:16,441
towards the back of the Ironseat Ridge, which 
is the mountain that Kymal is up against.

4548
04:10:16,441 --> 04:10:24,595
As you walk into the tavern, you see a little 
more than a dozen people in various clusters.

4549
04:10:24,595 --> 04:10:26,775
Some of them are ready to go,

4550
04:10:26,775 --> 04:10:29,929
they've been drinking since sundown 
and they're already pretty sauced.

4551
04:10:29,929 --> 04:10:35,194
There's a terrible off-key band in the corner 
of four people, three gentlemen and a lady--

4552
04:10:35,194 --> 04:10:37,167
TALIESIN: Terrible band name.

4553
04:10:37,167 --> 04:10:41,591
MATT: It's a terrible band name. And it's 
pretty bad.

4554
04:10:41,591 --> 04:10:49,130
And there you see, half-slumped over in 
the corner at the table, you see Kaylie,

4555
04:10:49,130 --> 04:10:51,414
just ready to pass out at the end.

4556
04:10:51,414 --> 04:10:56,743
LAURA: Fuck. Stay by the bar. I'll be 
right back.

4557
04:10:56,743 --> 04:10:58,268
MATT: Should I get our rooms?

4558
04:10:58,268 --> 04:11:00,098
LAURA: Fine. Yes, darling.

4559
04:11:00,098 --> 04:11:03,497
MATT: One room-- two rooms, she's 
paying, hold on.

4560
04:11:03,497 --> 04:11:04,827
LAURA: And I run off.

4561
04:11:04,827 --> 04:11:07,055
MATT: And he walks over towards the bar.

4562
04:11:07,055 --> 04:11:08,182
LIAM: He's going to be so pissed.

4563
04:11:08,182 --> 04:11:09,470
MARISHA: Yeah he is, he's going to be 
so pissed.

4564
04:11:09,470 --> 04:11:10,311
PATRICK: Ditch him.

4565
04:11:10,311 --> 04:11:14,316
MARISHA: I so approve of this, by the way. 
This is the way to do this. Okay, byeeee.

4566
04:11:14,316 --> 04:11:15,854
LIAM: Sorry!

4567
04:11:15,854 --> 04:11:18,000
MARISHA: Sorry!

4568
04:11:18,000 --> 04:11:21,077
MATT: Kaylie at the table.

4569
04:11:21,077 --> 04:11:23,067
LAURA: Kaylie.

4570
04:11:23,067 --> 04:11:24,820
MATT: What do you want from me.

4571
04:11:24,820 --> 04:11:26,070
LAURA: I smack her across the cheek.

4572
04:11:26,070 --> 04:11:28,981
MATT: "You--" She grabs the dagger and grabs 
you by the front of the shirt and brings it--

4573
04:11:28,981 --> 04:11:32,609
LAURA: Darling, your father! Scanlan. 
Tell me you're sober.

4574
04:11:32,609 --> 04:11:34,377
MATT: Oh, I remember you.

4575
04:11:34,377 --> 04:11:35,339
LAURA: Are you sober?

4576
04:11:35,339 --> 04:11:36,493
MATT: I'm never sober.

4577
04:11:36,493 --> 04:11:40,049
LAURA: Ah, fuck. Your father's hurt.

4578
04:11:40,049 --> 04:11:43,933
MATT: I don't want to deal with him 
right now. Tell him-- look.

4579
04:11:43,933 --> 04:11:47,207
LAURA: "Kaylie!" And I pick her up and 
bring her up to my eye-level.

4580
04:11:47,207 --> 04:11:51,804
MATT: I will kick your ass right now if 
you keep treating me like this.

4581
04:11:51,804 --> 04:12:02,740
LAURA: Your father. He died.

4582
04:12:02,740 --> 04:12:10,037
But there's a chance we can bring him 
back, if you're willing to help.

4583
04:12:10,037 --> 04:12:15,413
MATT: "How'd he die?" And she's still being 
held up, reaches over and grabs her tankard.

4584
04:12:15,413 --> 04:12:17,361
Her feet still dangling.

4585
04:12:17,361 --> 04:12:24,849
LAURA: Defending everyone. Saving the 
fucking land, can you believe it?

4586
04:12:24,849 --> 04:12:28,362
MATT: Who would want a death like that?

4587
04:12:28,362 --> 04:12:31,655
LAURA: He died with piss all over him.

4588
04:12:31,655 --> 04:12:35,984
MATT: That sounds like my father.

4589
04:12:35,984 --> 04:12:38,028
LAURA: Will you go?

4590
04:12:38,028 --> 04:12:38,951
MATT: And what?

4591
04:12:38,951 --> 04:12:41,055
LAURA: Will you help? Kaylie.

4592
04:12:41,055 --> 04:12:43,760
MATT: And help what?

4593
04:12:43,760 --> 04:12:57,959
LAURA: I set her on the table so we're 
still eye-level. All his words were of you.

4594
04:12:57,959 --> 04:13:11,856
Look, I know a little bit about having a father 
who wasn't around. Right? Take it from me.

4595
04:13:11,856 --> 04:13:18,126
It's not worth it. It's not worth 
harboring this hatred in your heart.

4596
04:13:18,126 --> 04:13:32,594
If you can find it in yourself to forgive 
him, you'll live a much happier life.

4597
04:13:32,594 --> 04:13:35,226
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

4598
04:13:35,226 --> 04:13:37,598
PATRICK: (singing) My father wasn't 
around...

4599
04:13:37,598 --> 04:13:45,326
LAURA and MARISHA: (singing) My 
father wasn't around...

4600
04:13:45,326 --> 04:13:48,679
MARISHA: Come on, Vex, come on.

4601
04:13:48,679 --> 04:13:52,222
LAURA: 25.

4602
04:13:52,222 --> 04:13:55,647
MATT: She looks at you for a second.

4603
04:13:55,647 --> 04:14:05,804
You can see her kind of frustrated piss-off 
facade drops a little and her eyes sink below.

4604
04:14:05,804 --> 04:14:11,867
"I really don't know what you think I can 
do, but, I mean.

4605
04:14:11,867 --> 04:14:16,186
"At the very least, I'd like to see his 
body before it's interred."

4606
04:14:16,186 --> 04:14:29,342
LAURA: I pull out the stone and I put it in 
her hand. Concentrate. Concentrate on him.

4607
04:14:29,342 --> 04:14:35,008
It'll bring you to him, I swear.

4608
04:14:35,008 --> 04:14:40,666
MATT: (sighs) So much strangeness surrounds you 
folks every time I cross paths with you, it seems.

4609
04:14:40,666 --> 04:14:43,391
LAURA: Please. Kaylie.

4610
04:14:43,391 --> 04:14:45,054
MATT: Can I take my drink?

4611
04:14:45,054 --> 04:14:52,442
LAURA: You can take whatever you want. 
Just promise me you'll try.

4612
04:14:52,442 --> 04:14:58,272
MATT: She holds the stone for a second 
and looks at it. Squints an eye.

4613
04:14:58,272 --> 04:15:00,125
"Listen, if you're trying to take the 
piss out of me--"

4614
04:15:00,125 --> 04:15:06,284
And her form just vanishes from the table.

4615
04:15:06,284 --> 04:15:08,456
It is pushing 11:20.

4616
04:15:08,456 --> 04:15:17,824
I think we will pick this up right there 
next week here in Whitestone for the ritual.

4617
04:15:17,824 --> 04:15:19,388
LIAM: All night long, man, all night long.

4618
04:15:19,388 --> 04:15:21,888
MATT: I'm trying to push the narrative as 
long as I can get, trying to get to a point,

4619
04:15:21,888 --> 04:15:24,305
but yeah, this is building and I don't 
want to drag us in here.

4620
04:15:24,305 --> 04:15:25,513
LAURA: It's just going.

4621
04:15:25,513 --> 04:15:27,115
MARISHA: Gah, it's going to be 
another Percy situation.

4622
04:15:27,115 --> 04:15:27,823
MATT: I know.

4623
04:15:27,823 --> 04:15:29,686
MARISHA: Scanlan's going to be dead 
for a week.

4624
04:15:29,686 --> 04:15:30,979
MATT: I can't force narrative.

4625
04:15:30,979 --> 04:15:33,554
MARISHA: Schrodinger's Scanlan.

4626
04:15:33,554 --> 04:15:38,700
MATT: Can't force narrative. All right, 
well, we will pick this up next week.

4627
04:15:38,700 --> 04:15:41,550
TALIESIN: Ironically of course, also, 
I don't think we have Sam next week.

4628
04:15:41,550 --> 04:15:42,858
MARISHA: Sam won't be here!

4629
04:15:42,858 --> 04:15:44,122
LAURA: Yeah, he's not here next--

4630
04:15:44,122 --> 04:15:46,804
MATT: Sam can't be here next week. 
Oh, that's going to be interesting.

4631
04:15:46,804 --> 04:15:49,080
LIAM: Push the narrative all night long 
like Lionel Ritchie, come on.

4632
04:15:49,080 --> 04:15:50,321
SAM: Get used to it!

4633
04:15:50,321 --> 04:15:53,815
(all laugh)

4634
04:15:53,815 --> 04:15:54,927
LAURA: No, Sam!

4635
04:15:54,927 --> 04:15:56,545
MATT: Oh, snap.

4636
04:15:56,545 --> 04:15:58,257
TALIESIN: Dick!

4637
04:15:58,257 --> 04:16:00,666
LIAM: If we wait, he's going to 
write us off.

4638
04:16:00,666 --> 04:16:04,272
TRAVIS: I hear him! I hear him from 
beyond!

4639
04:16:04,272 --> 04:16:06,370
LAURA: See, Grog? See?

4640
04:16:06,370 --> 04:16:10,919
MATT: All right, well, we'll figure it out. 
If worse comes to worst,

4641
04:16:10,919 --> 04:16:14,599
I'll play him, or we'll see if he can Skype 
in. We'll see. I don't know what he's doing.

4642
04:16:14,599 --> 04:16:16,113
I know he's gone. Like a tool.

4643
04:16:16,113 --> 04:16:17,552
MARISHA: Oh yeah, maybe he can Skype in.

4644
04:16:17,552 --> 04:16:21,079
TALIESIN: We can totally, like Zod in the 
mirror.

4645
04:16:21,079 --> 04:16:27,949
MATT: That's true. All right, well. With 
that, the Conclave lies destroyed.

4646
04:16:27,949 --> 04:16:29,051
LAURA: Oh my god.

4647
04:16:29,051 --> 04:16:31,902
MARISHA: (whoops)

4648
04:16:31,902 --> 04:16:42,718
MATT: Raishan's plot still not uncovered. One 
of two deaths reversed, one still on the line.

4649
04:16:42,718 --> 04:16:50,559
The tethering of the soul to the body 
withering with each fall.

4650
04:16:50,559 --> 04:16:58,131
And a surprisingly low-level paladin getting 
the final blow on an ancient green dragon.

4651
04:16:58,131 --> 04:16:59,335
LAURA: Nice!

4652
04:16:59,335 --> 04:17:00,818
TALIESIN: Way to David that goliath, man.

4653
04:17:00,818 --> 04:17:01,928
LAURA: Yeah, right?

4654
04:17:01,928 --> 04:17:05,202
MARISHA: Like, legit, we were all 
talking, we thought you were going to die.

4655
04:17:05,202 --> 04:17:07,712
PATRICK: Why do you think I showed up?

4656
04:17:07,712 --> 04:17:10,361
TALIESIN: We were like, I wonder if he's 
going to totally Coulson,

4657
04:17:10,361 --> 04:17:11,892
I wonder if he's just going to Coulson 
on us.

4658
04:17:11,892 --> 04:17:14,007
MARISHA: We thought you were going to be 
our Agent Coulson, yeah.

4659
04:17:14,007 --> 04:17:16,778
MATT: I honestly prepared that to be this-- 
like, we talked about that on the break,

4660
04:17:16,778 --> 04:17:20,095
it would've been an awesome heroic end 
to the story.

4661
04:17:20,095 --> 04:17:25,209
PATRICK: That's why I was here. I was going 
to throw my body in front of someone.

4662
04:17:25,209 --> 04:17:27,648
MATT: It just happened to work out that 
she was pinned straight to the side--

4663
04:17:27,648 --> 04:17:29,750
TRAVIS: Well, you didn't do a very good 
job of it, Patrick.

4664
04:17:29,750 --> 04:17:35,422
PATRICK: Oh, believe me, Kerrek much would've 
rather died than have this particular outcome.

4665
04:17:35,422 --> 04:17:39,698
MARISHA: Shoot for the moon, sometimes you'll 
land at the how do you want to do this.

4666
04:17:39,698 --> 04:17:41,129
MATT: I like that.

4667
04:17:41,129 --> 04:17:46,098
LIAM: Also, Feeblemind? Natural 20 on 
scanning the ocean?

4668
04:17:46,098 --> 04:17:47,540
LAURA: Pretty fucking great.

4669
04:17:47,540 --> 04:17:48,342
LIAM: Pretty amazing.

4670
04:17:48,342 --> 04:17:49,264
MATT: Yeah.

4671
04:17:49,264 --> 04:17:49,984
PATRICK: That was...

4672
04:17:49,984 --> 04:17:51,356
MARISHA: I had a few lucky rolls.

4673
04:17:51,356 --> 04:17:53,108
LAURA: Keyleth and Kerr MVPs for sure.

4674
04:17:53,108 --> 04:17:55,913
TALIESIN: Somebody conquered some 
personal demons, this week.

4675
04:17:55,913 --> 04:17:57,291
MARISHA: Yeah, I was waiting for this.

4676
04:17:57,291 --> 04:17:59,129
MATT: Well, Sam, we love you. 
Wherever you are.

4677
04:17:59,129 --> 04:18:00,144
TALIESIN: You're still an awkward mess, 
but you know.

4678
04:18:00,144 --> 04:18:02,823
MARISHA: Keyleth will always be an 
awkward mess.

4679
04:18:02,823 --> 04:18:07,148
As much character growth as you can have, 
you're still always you.

4680
04:18:07,148 --> 04:18:08,587
TALIESIN: There will always be a pit 
of fire.
