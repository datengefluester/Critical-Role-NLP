1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:05,033
ALISON: All right, we are back! I'm Alison
Haislip. You are watching the live stream for Geek

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:11,312
&amp; Sundry and Smart Girls for MDA. With me are the
people who need no introduction, I think, to

3
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:14,361
anyone in chat, but I'm here with Critical Role.

4
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:16,386
(cheering)

5
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:21,585
ALISON: They are going to critically roll very
shortly, but first we have to take care of some

6
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:30,138
business. As you know, in our last segment, we hit
$30,000. $33,000! LootCrate matched the last

7
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:36,384
thousand, so that got us up to $34,000. I think we
are now over $35,000, so thank you, everyone at home.

8
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:37,923
TRAVIS: That's incredible.

9
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:41,311
ALISON: But the biggest surprise that I had to
tell everyone is that you guys throughout this

10
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:47,377
whole stream have been buying shirts, much like
this one, the Critical Role shirt with MDA on the

11
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:55,082
back of it. You guys have raised over $7,000 with
the shirts. We are adding that to the ticker right

12
00:00:55,082 --> 00:01:02,681
now. And on top of that, Geek &amp; Sundry and Smart
Girls have decided to donate to get us up to $50,000.

13
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:05,571
(cheering)

14
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:12,300
ALISON: Critical Role, you are starting off the
counter at $50,000. We now want to get up to 60

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,607
grand before this thing ends. This stream is going
until about ten o'clock tonight. Yes, we know

16
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:21,505
that's over 24 hours. It's like a 27-hour
livestream. But check in the link. You can still

17
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:26,768
buy t-shirts like this. The link's in chat. You
can still buy shirts like this and many other

18
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:31,919
ones. You can find out how to donate there as
well. I'm going to stop talking because I know so

19
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:36,760
many people here have been waiting for you guys.
Thanks for sticking with me. I am signing off, and

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,866
I'm leaving you in the capable hands of Critical
Role. Donate, donate, donate!

21
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:47,076
MATT: You guys have been amazing. This is amazing.
We'll be playing this for the next three hours.

22
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:52,530
Come hang with us. Let me meet you over at my
table.

23
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,742
TRAVIS: He's got to run into the other studio.
He's got to take the elevator down to Studio-- oh, hey!

24
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,804
LIAM: How did you get there so fast?

25
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:05,170
MATT: Magic. Dungeon master magic. Although,
however, I'm not a dungeon master today. Today, I

26
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,219
am a marshal.

27
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:08,988
LAURA: (drawling) Well, all right.

28
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:13,840
MATT: Because we're playing Deadlands Reloaded.
For those of you who aren't familiar, Deadlands is

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,671
one of my favorite settings, called the Weird
West. And we're playing Deadlands Reloaded, which

30
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:26,030
brings it over into the Savage Worlds system,
which I've had to learn over the past few days. So

31
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,672
bear with us. It's going to be a rusty run for a
lot of us, learning and picking up things. We'll

32
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:33,978
probably going to get a shit-ton of things wrong,
and that's okay, because we're going to have fun

33
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:42,433
while doing it. Anyway. We're playing Deadlands.
And to give you guys the idea behind the world

34
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:49,366
that we're playing in, this takes place in the
19th century. Around 1864, an event called the

35
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:55,881
Reckoning transpired. What had happened is, as the
people of America began to push further west,

36
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:59,847
pushing a lot of the Native Americans out of their
land, and a bunch of terrible things happened to

37
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:04,053
their people and their tribes, a number of
disgruntled shamans and members of those tribes

38
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:11,770
came together and essentially did a giant shamanic
ritual to tear a hole between this world and this

39
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,581
extraplanar world of dark magic, introducing
entities called Reckoners that want to pass into

40
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:23,434
this world, and can they only do so by elevating
fear into this world. It also introduced magic. It

41
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:29,210
introduced a bunch of really weird, creepy things
into the old west, causing the Civil War to run

42
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:36,070
longer than it did in history, as well as a bunch
of other ridiculous circumstances. Nevertheless.

43
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,423
That is the setting that this game will take place
in. Before we get started, I want to go over a few

44
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:48,150
rules for you guys so you know what this charity
stream is all about. We have some cool things

45
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,316
called fate chips, which I'll get into here in a
minute. The fate chips, players and myself can use

46
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:59,733
to alter the circumstances in the game. A black
fate chip-- sorry for those of you who know the

47
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,500
rules, I didn't have any white chips, but they
work the same as white chips-- the black fate

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,537
chips can be spent by players to re-roll a single
trait or skill roll they're attempting to do. It's

49
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:14,170
a one-time reroll. The red chips can be used to
instead add a d6 to whatever trait or skill roll

50
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:20,285
they just made, but in using that red chip, I get
to pick one to add to my pool over here as the

51
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:25,367
marshal. A blue chip, which is probably the
strongest of them all, allows them to add that

52
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:29,944
same d6 to a trait or skill roll, but I don't get
to pick a chip out of there. That's pretty cool

53
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:35,426
for them. However, some of my more powerful
creatures or individuals in the game may have

54
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:41,601
their own set of fate chips. And if you donate,
looking at the list, you can go ahead and provide

55
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:46,589
additional fate chips to the players or me.

56
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,709
TRAVIS: Don't buy him shit.

57
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,125
(laughter)

58
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:53,217
LAURA: Or do. Donate. Buy him whatever you want.

59
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:56,433
MATT: Stack the deck however you feel it needs to
be stacked. Trust me on this one.

60
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,633
LIAM: Do we start out with one of each? Is that
correct?

61
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:02,511
MATT: You start with three of each. We're going to
get to that here in a moment.

62
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,316
LIAM: They're also delicious.

63
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:06,894
TRAVIS: Don't jump the... (dramatic pause) gun,
Liam.

64
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:08,259
(groans, laughs)

65
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,646
TRAVIS: Man. En fuego.

66
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:15,516
(donation music)

67
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:19,021
MATT: So. As it stands, if people want to donate
and affect the game, you can donate a hundred

68
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:24,648
bucks to give one of the players a black fate
chip. You can donate $150 to donate a red fate

69
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:33,330
chip to a player of your choice, $200 to give a
blue fate chip to the player of your choice, or

70
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,990
$200 to give me a fate chip of my choice, to use
against the players.

71
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,640
LAURA: Why do you get to--

72
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,787
MATT: Because I'm the marshal! I make the rules!

73
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:48,838
MARISHA: Is there ever going to be a situation
where you're like, "You know what, a black chip

74
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:50,833
will suffice. This'll be fine."

75
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:55,738
MATT: Possibly. Sometimes the rolls can be better
than additional ones. We'll see.

76
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:59,194
LIAM: Matt, I would like to point out that the
chat has typed the words "high noon" about 72,000

77
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,733
times in almost five minutes.

78
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,036
MATT: I can only assume so.

79
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:07,437
LAURA: If you donate $500, Matt will say "high
noon" whenever you want. (laughs) I'm sorry.

80
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:15,293
MATT: What have you done? What have you done,
Laura? In our final tier for this donating section

81
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:22,867
of this wonderful drive is if you donate $500 or
more, you get to add a single-sentence element to

82
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:27,610
the story currently. And the moment it comes into
play, it will be incorporated to and adjust the

83
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:34,257
current moment of the story's narrative, based on
your suggestion there. Try and be somewhat

84
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:37,718
respectful with that. We've had some crazy things
happen in the past that completely derailed the

85
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:44,978
game and that was fine for our Extra Life game,
which was crazy to begin with. This one-- if it's

86
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:48,176
a little crazy, I may tweak it a little bit to fit
into the narrative because I have to try and fit

87
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:51,788
it somehow, but I'm going to try to facilitate to
the best of my ability everything you guys suggest.

88
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:53,639
LIAM: Please don't break the universe.

89
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:58,958
MATT: Yeah. No Deck of Many Things in this,
please. That is the tier system we have in here

90
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,866
for this. To begin this circumstance--

91
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:04,793
LAURA: I'm so nervous!

92
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:10,239
MATT: Well, actually, before we do this, Laura?
Let's go ahead and introduce everybody's

93
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:13,413
characters, if you don't mind.

94
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:16,728
LIAM: They are so layered, and have so much
depth.

95
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,411
MARISHA: And we didn't all come up with them last
night.

96
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:22,874
MATT: Marisha, why don't you begin?

97
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:31,226
MARISHA: Okay. I tell them-- okay, yeah. We never
did this in Critical Role. I am Sudis. Sudis

98
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:41,141
Alifehr. I am a gypsy traveling vagabond who is
quite good at telling your fortune. Whatever the

99
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:47,141
cost, whatever the price, I can give you a little
bit of wisdom that might guide you on your way.

100
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:51,157
TRAVIS: Oh, snap. Okay. Wait, what was your name
again?

101
00:07:51,157 --> 00:08:00,066
MARISHA: Sudis. Sudis Alifehr. I've got lots of
braids all through my hair, and probably like in

102
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:07,939
my mid-30s, and I also have a peg leg. Also, by
the way? Peg leg.

103
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,745
LIAM: Where do your ancestors hail from?

104
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:20,649
MARISHA: Romania. But it's also 1875, so who the
fuck knows what was going on then--

105
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:26,796
MATT: She's a mutt. She's an Eastern European
mutt. Grew up in the Bronx. It's awkward. Liam!

106
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:28,033
Who are you?

107
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:32,671
LIAM: Hi. My my name is Reverend Forrest Alton.

108
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:35,277
MARISHA: Hi, Reverend!

109
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:40,523
LIAM: I am from upstate New York, near the
Canadian border.

110
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:43,389
(laughter)

111
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:53,139
LIAM: I don't know what's funny about this. I am a
chaplain in the Union army. The troops usually

112
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:59,756
want me around near the medical tent, because I
think with my spiritual guidance they find peace

113
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:07,360
and quicker healing, and I've seen some terrible
things in the war, and really want the war to end.

114
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,012
I don't want mankind to give in to its greater
demons. But somehow I've ended up in the Dakotas, and

115
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,541
I can't wait to find out how.

116
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,834
MATT: All right. Laura. Who are you playing?

117
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:28,002
LAURA: Oh, hi there. My name's Juniper Langley,
but if you call me that I just might shoot you in

118
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:34,895
the mouth. Everyone knows me calls me Stinky
Jules. That on account of the fact that I don't

119
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:44,934
like to bathe. My mother was an escort, but I
always preferred shooting men to fucking them, so

120
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:50,306
I decided to pick up a gun and fight my way
through life.

121
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,751
LIAM: We're going to be the best of friends.

122
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,559
LAURA: You've got a pretty mouth, Rev.

123
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,539
LIAM: I don't know how to respond to that.

124
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:59,295
TRAVIS: Oh. I don't even want to go anymore.

125
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,983
(laughter)

126
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:02,636
MATT: Travis. Who are you playing?

127
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:10,217
TRAVIS: Yes, my name is Sydney Hopkins
Trivelpiece. I have come from afar to chronicle

128
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:17,547
the adventures of the Wild West while you seek
your fortune in your misdeeds. I am afraid I'm not

129
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:24,734
well-adapted to this climate, but I am quite
interested in your journeys for gold or glory.

130
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:33,594
Reverend, you look quite the outstanding
gentleman. I don't drink, but a good, clean glass

131
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:41,017
of water does sound lovely. You smell terrible,
and I'm not quite sure how I feel about you, but

132
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:48,092
if you know of anything going on that would make a
good story for me, that could really help my career.

133
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:52,578
LIAM: Question, because I have trouble scrubbing
Grog and you out of my mind, are you like a buck twenty?

134
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:58,870
TRAVIS: I'm very light. I don't eat very much. If
I'm in the sun too long, terrible things happen.

135
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,999
(laughter)

136
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:09,516
MATT: All righty. As a heads-up to all of you guys
watching, by the way, if your children are in the

137
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:14,774
room and you don't want them hearing a lot of
curse words, there's going to be a lot of swearing

138
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,435
during this game. Just a heads-up.

139
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:22,423
LAURA: Potentially. I could watch my mouth. Sorry
about that cussing earlier.

140
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,168
TRAVIS: Taint-sniffer.

141
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:29,199
MATT: All right, so. Let's go ahead and divvy up
some of these fate chips. I need each of you guys

142
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,488
to go ahead and pull three at random out of this.

143
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:36,731
TRAVIS: Just three.

144
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:40,801
LAURA: Oh wait, so we don't get to choose? All
right. I might get all blue.

145
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,281
MATT: Two reds and a black.

146
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:47,082
LAURA: Where's the bowl?!

147
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,408
MATT: Bowl's here.

148
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:53,715
LAURA: I don't care! Aw. Two blacks and a red.

149
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:57,816
LIAM: Guide my hand.

150
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:00,163
LAURA: Are there not as many blue ones as there
are--

151
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,191
MATT: Correct.

152
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:02,729
LAURA: Oh, well, that makes sense.

153
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:04,372
MARISHA: What just happened?

154
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:08,270
LIAM: Oh, one of each! Praise Jesus!

155
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,639
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank the Lord.

156
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,350
(laughter)

157
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,337
TRAVIS: Man of God. You're like Russell Crowe in
Quick and the Dead, aren't you?

158
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:22,539
MARISHA: Two reds and one blue.

159
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,668
LIAM: I am the straight man, is what I am.

160
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:26,440
TRAVIS: You are!

161
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,236
MATT: Now, I'm going to go ahead and pull a few
here for myself.

162
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:33,512
LIAM: Three blues, one two three.

163
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:35,847
LAURA: Do we get to know what you got? Damn it!

164
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,687
TRAVIS: Really? Show us one.

165
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:42,607
MATT: Also, as a fun little quick here to start us
off, so Laura's character took one of the edges

166
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:46,927
called Veteran of the Weird West. Which gave her
some great opportunities, she's a more seasoned

167
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:51,611
character than the rest of them, she's seen more
about the world, but in doing so, some strange,

168
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:54,880
interesting circumstance in her background is
going to come into play, so I've shuffled these

169
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,616
cards, and I want you, Laura, to randomly select
one of them, if you don't mind. Take your pick.

170
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:02,001
LAURA: Where's that deck?!

171
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,248
TRAVIS: Where's that what?

172
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:05,307
LAURA: That deck. (laughs) Shut up.

173
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:07,437
TRAVIS: Said it twice, didn't get it.

174
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:10,454
MATT: Three of hearts, so looking at the table,
here.

175
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:13,087
LAURA: Oh no, what'd I get?

176
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,610
TRAVIS: Each card has a thing?

177
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,048
MARISHA: Do we get to know?

178
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,628
MATT: Sure, because why not? You chose the Hunted
card.

179
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:24,038
LAURA: Oh, shit.

180
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:31,551
MATT: Something or someone that you didn't finish
the job on is currently trying to find you. We'll

181
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,746
see how that works out in the long run.

182
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,896
LIAM: Wow.

183
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:39,290
MATT: (cackles)

184
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,227
MARISHA: I'm just saying that, you didn't need to,
I could've told you that. Just saying.

185
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:44,861
MATT: All right, so.

186
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:49,871
MARISHA: I know your gun looks cleaner than your
face.

187
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:54,030
LAURA: That's right. I like to take good care of
my weapons.

188
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,650
TRAVIS: You're very intimidating.

189
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,741
MATT: This conversation all takes place in a
carriage, as the four of you are currently riding

190
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:03,499
to your destination for your different purposes
and different reasons, which you may discuss at

191
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:08,015
your own leisure, or not, or make up at your own
leisure, or not. The four of you have been

192
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:17,291
traveling for days in this hot, humid, muggy
carriage, to your final destination of Deadwood,

193
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,603
South Dakota.

194
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:20,998
LIAM: (singing) Sweet little light of mine, I'm
going to let it shine.

195
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:26,350
MATT: Founded in the Deadwood Gulch at the
discovery of gold by an expedition by Custer in

196
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,999
1874, they had to abandon the government's
incursion to seize these gold veins when the

197
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:36,629
effects of the Reckoning, and the ensuing quakes,
began to swell in the western regions of the

198
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:42,102
United States. But word of the rich veins still
found their way to the public ears here and there,

199
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:47,442
and folks seeking quick money and an escape from
the mounting chaos of the still-dragging civil war

200
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:54,069
swarmed into the gulch to raise up this lawless
city of gold, sin, and vice. Managing to be far

201
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:58,841
enough away from politics, rumors still find their
way to this rugged town of strange goings-on in

202
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:04,434
the world, tales of slain Yankee and Southern
soldiers rising from the muck post-battle, of

203
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:10,945
shadows moving in the night to steal children. Of
mystics, calling spirits to do their bidding. Even

204
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:15,496
so, the people of Deadwood are toughened already
by harsh, untrusting reality, and such folk tales

205
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:21,212
have no place in a man's world. The sun has just
set as the denizens of Deadwood scatter to the

206
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,544
bars to get shitfaced.

207
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:24,729
(loud bang off-screen)

208
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:35,414
MATT: Everybody down! All right. That totally
distracted me. You all sit, after arriving,

209
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:41,635
exhausted and tired from your journey, within the
city of Deadwood, finding yourself at the

210
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:48,323
immediate display of the first place that comes to
your eyes, and seeking rest and an escape from the

211
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,700
worries of the world, you all step into and relax
in the Bella Union Saloon.

212
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,030
MARISHA: Ooh, the Bella Union!

213
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,451
MATT: Already got one?

214
00:15:58,451 --> 00:15:59,932
OFF-SCREEN: Oh, several.

215
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:02,235
MATT: Oh no.

216
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:05,393
(laughter)

217
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,484
MATT: It's already started. How do I read the long
ones?

218
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,139
LAURA: Oh, jeez.

219
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:14,107
MATT: Pardon me a second. We've already got some
amazing donations, I have to read them all. There

220
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,006
we go. "All players start the scenario--" Uh-oh.

221
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:20,481
LIAM: Oh, we're making rules for us?

222
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:26,445
MATT: Apparently. You guys spend the evening
resting within the Bella Union. After drinks and

223
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:32,660
relaxation, the next morning's sun rises, and you
all realize you've all woken within the same bed

224
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:40,087
as the others. Not necessarily recalling what the
evening before entailed, but.

225
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:41,387
LAURA: That was fun.

226
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:42,804
MARISHA: Get off me.

227
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:49,172
LIAM: I don't even drink. How did that happen?

228
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:50,390
TRAVIS: Nothing, nothing.

229
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,450
LAURA: Sydney--

230
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:57,004
MATT: It's at this time you all realize you've
slept in rather late in the day, as it's now

231
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:59,971
apparently-- (McCree voice) It's high noon.

232
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:03,321
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch! How long would it take?

233
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:10,740
LIAM: Hey, Marshal? I don't know the rules really
at all in this game, but I think I read somewhere

234
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:18,254
that if I sin, I get negatives? So I don't know
that I've sinned, but I might have sinned. I don't know.

235
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,830
LAURA: I think you sinned.

236
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:25,588
MARISHA: Wait, can I do an onus check on him to
figure out what we did?

237
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:28,492
MATT: Hold on, I'm trying to keep up here, guys!

238
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:31,211
(laughter)

239
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:38,313
MATT: Mark down you each have a joker card now.
That can be used instead of a poker chip.

240
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:41,471
LAURA: What's a joker card?

241
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:45,752
LIAM: We've got to establish the rules before we
blow them up, folks.

242
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:47,581
MATT: I know, it's all good, it's all good.

243
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:52,030
TRAVIS: Somebody throw me a pen back there.

244
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:58,126
MATT: We'll begin the game here in a moment, once
I get through these. You guys-- oh, and I also

245
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:05,050
receive two random joker cards. So I have two
jokers. So. Those joker cards can be used in place

246
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,647
of a poker chip. We'll say the black on that one.

247
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:11,029
LAURA: A black poker chip?

248
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:15,054
MATT: All right, let me reset here and make sure I
get to the other ones.

249
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,748
(laughter)

250
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:22,803
MATT: Oh, and Travis, you go ahead and get a black
chip.

251
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:24,074
TRAVIS: Yes!

252
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:25,486
LAURA: Oh, damn it!

253
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:32,599
MATT: All awkwardly waking up at (McCree voice)
high noon (normal) you awkwardly gather your

254
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,754
things, finding yourself, the music in the
distance as the Bella Union is beginning to come

255
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:46,055
to life again. You can hear a piano playing and
some laughter, you hear some loud carousing on the

256
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:50,976
other side of your door to the inn, the second
floor of which you now currently are awakening.

257
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:57,580
TRAVIS: I do hate to trouble you. Does anyone see
the chamberpot in the room? I am afraid I have a

258
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,967
rather-- need.

259
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,357
LAURA: Lean your shit out the window.

260
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,119
TRAVIS: Out the window?

261
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,611
LAURA: Yeah, that's what they do here.

262
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,594
TRAVIS: Right. Okay.

263
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:10,313
LAURA: I'm going to go get some whisky.

264
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:15,589
MARISHA: This is a good place to actually make
good money off of fortune telling. I'm going to go

265
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:16,800
downstairs.

266
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,150
TRAVIS: Reverend?

267
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,878
LIAM: Yes?

268
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:22,396
TRAVIS: Do you remember what happened last night?

269
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:29,230
LIAM: I don't. I remember someone pouring
something into my glass, I assumed it was

270
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:38,269
lemonade. I need to take a walk and do a little
thinking. See you later?

271
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:43,485
MATT: As you guys step out at your own individual
pace, you pass by a gentleman who's on the

272
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:47,181
second-floor balcony staring down into the main
thoroughfare of the Bella Union--

273
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:49,889
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

274
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:57,866
MATT: --a dark maroon coat and pants, short,
grey-ish hair, an intense dark mustache, and a

275
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:01,847
very, very angular face. He looks angrily down
amongst the people. And you can see at the tables,

276
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:06,988
the gambling tables are alight this early in the
day, and there appears to be a very intense game

277
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:11,487
of cards going on, and people are gathering
around, looking to see what the next stage is

278
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:14,502
going to be during this game. You guys go down to
find yourselves a drink?

279
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:16,079
LAURA: Shit, I want to watch the game.

280
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,525
MATT: Drinks first, or game first?

281
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:23,444
LAURA: Drink, and then watch the game, because I
really want to see the game. Fast, fast. Give me

282
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:24,870
some whiskey.

283
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,122
MATT: All right. You guys each throw a dollar
down. You go ahead and get yourself a very fine

284
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:29,640
pouring of some whisky.

285
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,570
TRAVIS: A sarsaparilla for me, if you don't mind.

286
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,845
MATT: The guy at the bar hands the drinks over and
goes, "Yeah, you would want a sarsaparilla,

287
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:39,701
"wouldn't you? Tell you what. It's on the house."

288
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:44,601
TRAVIS: That's very kind of you! There is chivalry
alive in the west!

289
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:46,832
LIAM: Could I have a black coffee, please?

290
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,732
MATT: "Black coffee? That can be provided."

291
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:53,179
MARISHA: Jules, did you spike our drinks last
night? Was that you?

292
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:55,515
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

293
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:56,789
MARISHA: Never mind.

294
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,691
MATT: You drink your fine, fine alcohol, which
enables you to have a black chip.

295
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:03,463
LAURA: Oh, shit! I can't catch!

296
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:09,966
MATT: So. As you guys begin to gather around this
poker game, you look down and you can see folks

297
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:12,987
are tense and looking over. They're starting to
cheer. Some folks are making their own side bets

298
00:21:12,987 --> 00:21:17,776
off the circumstance. The visible layer of tobacco
smoke is beginning to cloud the upper atmosphere

299
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:27,386
of the Bella Union. It's very palpable at this
point. Looking in, you can see four men at a table

300
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:32,205
that are all very intent, and one gentleman who's
very well dressed, similar in fashion to you. A

301
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:38,789
very nice light gray suit, a very well-trimmed
goatee, balding on top, with very short-cut hair

302
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:42,242
on the sides, and a little pair of spectacles at
the end of his nose. He's looking at his cards

303
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:46,391
with a big smile. Everyone starts putting the last
of their bets into the center.

304
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,191
LAURA: What's the other guy look like?

305
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:53,562
MATT: There are two other gentlemen you can see,
that both look greasy, like they haven't really

306
00:21:53,562 --> 00:22:01,032
slept in a long while, covered in dirt and crud,
but they seem to have a large cache of chips at

307
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:05,982
their side. Probably some of the various claim
workers out here outside of the town. And you see

308
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:10,354
one of the gentlemen is wearing a top hat, similar
to the one that you're wearing, with a fine, long

309
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:19,030
mustache, handlebar out, a portly, older
gentleman, looking at his hand. "Oh, hell. I'm

310
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,434
"going in."

311
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:24,500
LAURA: He's bluffing. That one's bluffing.

312
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,349
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

313
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,358
MATT: One of them goes "all right!" and pushes
in.

314
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:30,992
(laughter)

315
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:33,154
TRAVIS: Two of them are in? Two of the three?

316
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:39,119
MATT: The inspiration of seeing all this energy,
you being away, inspires you to go ahead. Have

317
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:46,744
yourself another black chip. You guys watch as
suddenly they all throw their cards down. Full house.

318
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:53,423
Pair of queens. Got a bunch of different cards,
and all of a sudden it comes to the well-dressed

319
00:22:53,423 --> 00:23:01,425
character, who looks a little nervous now, and
goes, "Hmm. Straight flush." And everyone goes--

320
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:08,689
big upset. Loud uproar. You can see now as the guy
with the long mustache goes, "Oh, hell." Throws

321
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:12,341
his cards down and gets up from the table angrily
and turns around to walk away. The two other

322
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:17,240
gentlemen at the table glance out the side of
their eye as one of the guys you see at the edge

323
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,893
of this table game, an older, hunched-over
gentleman with glasses at the end of his nose and

324
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:28,290
a smearing of black powder across his face goes,
"I love poker! It's the most crazy game ever!"

325
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,853
(laughter)

326
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:34,957
MATT: "Do that?! It makes no sense!" At which
point, one of the guys at the table goes, "You're

327
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:38,887
"right, it doesn't make sense. This guy's a
cheater! We have a goddamn fucking cheater here!"

328
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:40,822
LAURA: That's right! He's a fucking cheater, I can
tell!

329
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:43,170
TRAVIS: I don't think so. I believe he had what
they call the nuts.

330
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,008
MATT: "Thank you very much. That man knows what
he's talking about. I'm not cheating! You've seen

331
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,500
"me play cards in front of you! This has been an
amazing game."

332
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,480
LAURA: Look up his sleeves! That one's cheating.

333
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,909
MATT: At which point you can see one of the guys
who lost in the game immediately goes for a

334
00:23:52,909 --> 00:24:01,720
swinging punch towards the guy holding the-- who
won the actual last pot. And with that, whack!

335
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,339
Cracks it right across his face.

336
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:05,244
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

337
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:09,987
MATT: "All right!" he says as he punches him down.
Suddenly a giant brawl begins to emerge in the

338
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:14,004
center of this room. You can see people throwing
hooks left and right. The guy who currently won

339
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:18,771
the game is trying to grab the chips he has off to
the side as you can see the two guys at the front

340
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:21,780
of the guard of the Bella Union rushing in and
trying to hold folks down.

341
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:29,938
MARISHA: While the brawl breaks out, Sudis starts
trying to palm a few coins.

342
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:31,762
LAURA: I jump in the fight.

343
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:38,956
MARISHA: Oh, no! Oh, no, don't hurt me! Grabbing
all the coins I can. I'm innocent, oh!

344
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:41,538
LAURA: Yeah, I punched him.

345
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:42,877
MATT: Seeing this chaos...

346
00:24:42,877 --> 00:24:44,032
LAURA: Oh, shit!

347
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:51,199
MATT: That was a good catch. Meant to be. All this
is breaking down. You can see punches going left

348
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,902
and right. People falling down. The guy who had
his chips in his arm gets socked again and lobs

349
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:57,379
them into the table. Folks start scrambling for
them.

350
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:59,336
MARISHA: Oh, no! Let me help you pick up your
chips!

351
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:04,415
MATT: Go ahead and make an agility trait check, if
you don't mind.

352
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:11,835
MARISHA: Okay, so I roll a d6. I roll 2d6, is that
what I do? And take the higher? I rolled five both times.

353
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:18,195
MATT: Five both times? All right. You manage to
pocket what would be about $200 worth of poker

354
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:25,550
chips from the ground. You start getting in the
fray there. All right, Stinky Jules. Who are you

355
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,107
going for? You can see a bunch of different
people.

356
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:28,507
LAURA: I'm going for the one that was cheating!

357
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,560
MATT: The one that was cheating? All right.

358
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,855
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

359
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:38,760
MATT: All right! (laughs) This black chip goes to
the new thief. That's the chip you find.

360
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,151
LAURA: Whoa, she got two of them?

361
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:50,370
MATT: That one is off the table. All right, so the
guy's: "Please, I'm just trying-- I won it fair

362
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,941
"and square!" Go ahead and make a fighting roll.

363
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:54,899
LAURA: Okay. What is that?

364
00:25:54,899 --> 00:26:02,512
MATT: Whatever your fighting dice is, plus-- Your
fighting skill. Roll 2d6 and take the higher of

365
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:04,122
the two.

366
00:26:04,122 --> 00:26:07,493
LAURA: Oh, shit. Two. Fuck.

367
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:15,702
MATT: Two? You swing towards him and he dodges out
of the way. "Oh, dear!" Grabs what he can of the

368
00:26:15,702 --> 00:26:17,340
poker chips and darts out of the saloon.

369
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,879
MARISHA: Can I try and trip him?

370
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,095
MATT: Sure! As you're grabbing things?

371
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:25,308
MARISHA: I want to reach out and grab his leg, see
if I can trip him while I'm picking up--

372
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:27,294
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check.

373
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:34,694
MARISHA: Four. Four again. I don't know! Doubles,
doubles.

374
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:45,647
MATT: A four? You reach out and you grab towards
his leg, and he trips over as you yank out the

375
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,369
ankle from underneath him. He goes spilling. All
the chips go scattering onto the front of the

376
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:53,406
Bella Union. And you can see, while the guards are
currently inside dealing with this fight that's

377
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:57,774
broken out, there's nobody outside to guard it. A
couple people on the street look over and, "Is he

378
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:02,121
"all right? Sir, are you all right?" They start
coming towards him to his aid. He turns around and

379
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,582
looks at you and goes, "Why would you do that?"

380
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:08,761
MARISHA: Well-- ow! You stepped on my finger! Ow!

381
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:14,329
TRAVIS: I would like to rush over to him and offer
him asylum in our room. Sir, you are impeccably

382
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:18,018
dressed. Please, follow me to my room upstairs.
Quickly!

383
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:21,360
MATT: "Thank you. Help me gather these things,
please, before they take my hard-earned winnings!"

384
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,465
You guys begin gathering up into the hats, getting
all the poker chips into the various hats. The

385
00:27:26,465 --> 00:27:30,622
guys who were now brawling have been calmed down
at this point. You can see now the guards have

386
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:35,879
their pistols out. One of them fires twice into
the ceiling of the Bella Union, sending dust and

387
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:41,310
little bits of plaster debris to fall. All the
fight ends as one of the guys is now shouting,

388
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:49,465
"Everyone! Calm your shit. And you're all kicked
out for now while we assess what the hell just

389
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:54,062
"went down." You see the man who was looking over
the top of the balcony now has risen up over the

390
00:27:54,062 --> 00:28:01,419
edge and goes, "Thank you, my good man. All of
you, understand we only want civilized folks here

391
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:07,645
"at the Bella Union. The man won fair and square.
Give him his earnings. And if I see any of you try

392
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:12,219
"and throw a punch in here again, you're banned from
gambling in my establishment."

393
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:15,660
MARISHA: What is 'civilized'?

394
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:21,003
TRAVIS: It means orderly. The opposite of chaos.

395
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:26,394
MATT: As you begin walking upstairs, both of you
carrying your hats and his nose in the air a bit,

396
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:31,173
walking with you, giving you a smile, and,
"Thanks, brother. I appreciate the assist."

397
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:32,686
TRAVIS: Not to worry.

398
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:37,244
MATT: As you pop upstairs, you, keeping watch,
feel a strange sensation touching your left

399
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:44,183
shoulder. You glance over and see a wild monkey. A
small monkey that curls up next to you.

400
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:46,511
(chittering)

401
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:52,501
MARISHA: Can I do a notice check to see if it's a
real monkey or where the fuck the monkey came from?

402
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:53,810
MATT: Go ahead and make a notice check, yes.

403
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,911
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

404
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:56,553
MARISHA: All right, I will!

405
00:28:56,553 --> 00:28:58,922
LAURA: Whose shoulder is it on? Is it on his or on
hers?

406
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:06,336
MATT: It's her shoulder. All right. It is indeed a
real monkey. It is a straight-up real monkey.

407
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:11,416
MARISHA: Wait. If I roll a six, do I roll again?
On all checks?

408
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:16,253
MATT: On all checks. If you roll a maximum of the
die, you roll again and you add it to.

409
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:18,139
MARISHA: Nine.

410
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:23,151
MATT: There's your black chip, by the way. Oh,
man. You guys are going to be fine in combat when

411
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:30,464
we get to that. So. You at this point look over
and see the monkey. This is a live monkey, and as

412
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:35,841
you look in, it reaches in and grabs the edge of
your earlobe and whispers into your ear, "Do not

413
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,907
"worry. I've got your back."

414
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:39,029
MARISHA: (yelps)

415
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,301
(laughter)

416
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:42,543
MATT: You guys look over. There's no monkey.

417
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:48,071
MARISHA: I take him and I try and spike him on the
ground.

418
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:51,871
LAURA: Hey, Sue? What's your problem?

419
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:53,767
LIAM: You've had enough. Let's put this aside.

420
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:55,208
MARISHA: Is he still there?

421
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:59,430
MATT: As you throw the monkey to the ground, he
goes-- (angry noise) Climbs back up onto your

422
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,748
shoulder and says, "Why would you do that to me?
I'm here to guide you!"

423
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:06,360
LAURA: I think that shit I gave her last night is
fucking her up.

424
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,592
MARISHA: Monkey. You see?

425
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:11,904
LAURA: That's a shoulder, hon.

426
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:15,533
LIAM: You want to maybe get some fresh air?

427
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:21,375
MARISHA: I pet the monkey a bit.

428
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:25,186
TRAVIS: Oh dear. I'm afraid she's lost her beans.

429
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:29,762
MATT: As you're walking, you pass by the guy who
had the nice top hat and the mustache who's

430
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:34,750
sitting there, and he has an apron on and he looks
like, sleeves rolled up, a working fellow in the

431
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:45,570
camp in his later forties, and you hear him mutter
to himself, as I get a red chip, "That fella damn

432
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:50,380
"well cleared out the Gem last week and looks like
he's taking this place for all it's worth. Last

433
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,733
"time I go gambling in a while."

434
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:57,945
LAURA: So he was cheating. We weren't just saying
that so we could punch him?

435
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,709
MATT: "I'm only assuming he's cheating. He came
into this town no more than a couple weeks back,

436
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:04,457
"and damn well took all the Gem was worth before
coming here a week later."

437
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:06,723
LAURA: Was he wearing all them fancy clothes when
he got to town?

438
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:07,810
MATT: "He was."

439
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,075
TRAVIS: Sir, do you happen to know his name?

440
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:18,358
MATT: You're walking up the stairs away from this.
You're actually helping this gentleman up to put

441
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:24,483
stuff in the room. He goes, "I don't know his full
name, rightly so, but from what I've heard, he

442
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,394
refers to himself as Simon. Yeah."

443
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:29,059
LAURA: Sounds like a shit.

444
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:36,246
MATT: "Doesn't he? Sounds like a northern chap.
I've got to go, well, see what else I can sell to

445
00:31:36,246 --> 00:31:40,717
"make up for this debt from today. Excuse me."
Turns around and says, "By the way, if any of you

446
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:46,772
"guys want to come by my place, we also have poker
there. Not quite as upper-class as this, but we

447
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,736
"have fine drinks, cheaper than you'd find at this
place."

448
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,568
LAURA: Where's your place?

449
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:55,919
MATT: "Oh, it's down past the main thoroughfare to
the left. It's by the alley side there." And he

450
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,166
adjusts his hat.

451
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,204
LAURA: You got a picture on the outside of that
place there? What's it look like?

452
00:32:01,204 --> 00:32:06,106
MATT: "The Number Ten Saloon is what you're
looking for. Nice fine sign, yes. Recommend it.

453
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:10,278
"Any time." And he turns around and starts to
leave.

454
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:14,315
LIAM: You seem troubled. Are you carrying a heavy
load?

455
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:27,204
MARISHA: No, he's not very heavy at all, actually.
He's only like five pounds or so. (sighs)

456
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:34,655
LIAM: I've seen many soldiers shell-shocked in
war--

457
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:37,858
MARISHA: I wander off and I start speaking off in
my own language towards the sky.

458
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:38,920
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

459
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,069
MARISHA: All right.

460
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:42,170
(laughter)

461
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,796
LIAM: I give her her space. I'm a little nervous.

462
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:49,619
MARISHA: What do I call you?

463
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:53,513
MATT: "Call me Manatou."

464
00:32:53,513 --> 00:33:00,204
MARISHA: Manatou. Okay. Okay, Manatou. All right.

465
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:03,754
MATT: Curls back up into your hair and seemingly
becomes weightless for a moment.

466
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:05,297
LIAM: Into her hair?

467
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:08,275
MATT: You don't sense him there. It's like he
vanished.

468
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:11,335
LIAM: He was behind your ear the whole time.

469
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:12,895
(laughter)

470
00:33:12,895 --> 00:33:18,697
MATT: Stacking the deck over here for me, guys.

471
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,090
LAURA: Oh, shit, really?

472
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,470
LIAM: You fuckers.

473
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,208
LAURA: Why, why? Be nice to him so he'll help us.

474
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:33,485
MATT: You make your way up to the room and the
gentleman goes, "I greatly appreciate this. Thank

475
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:37,303
"you so much for your aid. If I could have my
chips, please."

476
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:48,207
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, of course. Hold out your hat and
I'll transfer them. That looks about it. There you go.

477
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:56,010
MATT: He's going to go ahead and look keenly into
your hat. I'm going to use a chip for that.

478
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,129
TRAVIS: Do I roll something?

479
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:09,384
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll-- do you have a
stealth skill? I think you roll a straight agility

480
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:12,298
check. Just go agility. See how quickly you can
maneuver this.

481
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:15,144
LIAM: He does have a copy of "You're Never Weird
On The Internet".

482
00:34:15,144 --> 00:34:20,943
TRAVIS: That's a six, and a two, so eight.

483
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:22,229
MATT: Okay.

484
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,708
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

485
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,775
LAURA: All right, he got all his--

486
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:33,174
MATT: "I greatly appreciate your help. Everything
appears to be good here. And what is your name?"

487
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:39,218
TRAVIS: Oh, I am Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece, at
your service. Lovely meeting you.

488
00:34:39,218 --> 00:34:41,228
MATT: Shakes your hand. It's a limp shake.

489
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:42,709
TRAVIS: You seem to be very good at this game.

490
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:48,880
MATT: "Well, I'm also new here. I can see by your
appearance that you also are new. Your clothes are

491
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,439
"far too clean to have been here."

492
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:51,947
TRAVIS: Yes, it's very difficult in this climate.

493
00:34:51,947 --> 00:34:57,439
MATT: "Yes, it's dusty, even for winter out here.
Yes, well, Simon Tyrell."

494
00:34:57,439 --> 00:35:03,063
TRAVIS: Simon. Absolute pleasure. Sir, how did you
get to be so good at that game? What is it you do here?

495
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:08,613
MATT: "Here, I'm finding my way. I'm a retired
business manager from Boston, but I came a long

496
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:13,449
"way at the behest of my cousin and I heard that
there was quite a booming gold trade in this city,

497
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:18,907
"so I came to, after building my luck up and
getting a small cache of money, realizing that I

498
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:23,505
"had a knack at this game called poker, and
apparently poker here can be very high-stakes,

499
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:25,605
"and, well, so far so good."

500
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:31,883
TRAVIS: Wonderful, you seem to be quite successful
at-- poker, you say? Goodness. If I may say, if

501
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:38,459
you find anyone having particular luck in that
gold boom, would you mind sending word my way? I

502
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:43,519
write to a very famous publication. I could put
you among the stars.

503
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,500
MATT: "Happily, happily. Good to hear from that.
We shall be in touch. Where are you-- are you

504
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,562
"staying here in this--"

505
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:56,362
TRAVIS: Yes, this room, with a few traveling
compatriots of mine. Watch out for some. Others

506
00:35:56,362 --> 00:36:00,660
are smelly. Some are trustworthy and others are
quite strange.

507
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:07,445
MATT: "Right. Okay. I appreciate that. We'll be in
touch." And he goes to put his hat on. (chuckles)

508
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:19,093
"Close." Leaves the room, closes the door behind
him. You have got $60 worth of chips that you

509
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,525
managed to pull out of that, and a red chip to
Laura.

510
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:28,028
LAURA: Yes! (growls) Thanks, friends.

511
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:32,578
MATT: So. You guys regather yourselves. You've had
a bit of chaos in your--

512
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:33,729
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

513
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,884
LAURA: All right! This is a good day.

514
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,935
MARISHA: We're going to go places, Manatou, me and
you, bud. Me and you.

515
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:40,851
TRAVIS: I come down as well after he leaves.

516
00:36:40,851 --> 00:36:46,978
LIAM: I've been making my way through the bar and
I'm sure there's some bloodied eyes and some teeth

517
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:50,084
knocked out, so I'll administer what limited first
aid I know.

518
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:56,019
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a medicine check.
Healing, this would be healing.

519
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:58,448
LIAM: Okay. Okay.

520
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:01,495
MATT: d8 and a d6, take the higher of the two.

521
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:03,295
LIAM: Okay, now. Two fives!

522
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:07,459
MATT: The first guy you walk up to is one of the
guys in the bar fight. You can see his eye's

523
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:12,604
fairly swollen, looks like he has a cut lip and
one of his arms is-- he's massaging a heavy,

524
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:17,193
swollen bruise on the side. As you approach him,
he's sitting at a table. What do you do?

525
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,945
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

526
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:26,732
LIAM: I say, all right. I have some bandages here.
No sudden movements, I just want to help you out.

527
00:37:26,732 --> 00:37:28,962
Trouble leads to trouble, friend.

528
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:42,927
MATT: "Look, I don't mean any disrespect, here,
I'm just weird with medical stuff. I prefer to be

529
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,186
"holistic. Heal on my own."

530
00:37:46,186 --> 00:37:47,391
LAURA: I'm with you, son.

531
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,760
MATT: "That's right."

532
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,406
LIAM: Well, it's funny. If you want to forego the
physical, I do have a little know-how with the

533
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,764
spiritual. Would you prefer we take it in that
direction?

534
00:37:57,764 --> 00:38:02,486
MATT: "That's even stranger. I'm not going to
lie--" And he leans in to you and goes, "Sorry, I

535
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:08,370
"noticed you carousing with that there foreigner,
and I saw her speaking to the spirits and mumbling

536
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,773
"to herself, and--" You don't actually hear, you're just
out of earshot of this, unless you want to make a

537
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:17,728
notice check to overhear. Make a notice check,
actually.

538
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,494
MARISHA: Sure, yeah, notice check.

539
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:21,568
MATT: Black chip for Laura. They're loading you
up.

540
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:23,446
LAURA: Oh shit, I can't catch for shit.

541
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:25,642
MARISHA: Nine.

542
00:38:25,642 --> 00:38:33,466
MATT: You overhear this even from a distance with
your keen ears. He says, "I have friends that come from

543
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:39,580
"eastern Europe, distant family member, we'll say.
There's something about her accent that's wrong."

544
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,073
MARISHA: That's probably true. That's accurate.

545
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:53,318
LIAM: I'm no man or woman's judge. I don't know
her. I'm happy to help you. You seem like you need

546
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:58,398
succor and aid, and I will give that to you. I
wouldn't be too quick to judge her.

547
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:02,708
MARISHA: Can I size him up from a distance? Get a
bead on him?

548
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,778
MATT: Make another notice check, and you, make a
persuasion check.

549
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:08,602
LIAM: That's-- the fuck is that?

550
00:39:08,602 --> 00:39:13,033
MARISHA: Five.

551
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:16,027
LAURA: Hey, Rev! I could use some succor and aid.

552
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:17,443
LIAM: Six.

553
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:23,250
MATT: Okay, he goes, "All right. Go ahead and see
what you can tend to." As you start tending to

554
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,964
him, he starts whispering to you to the side. You
try and size him up. He looks like a brutish guy

555
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:32,149
who probably works in the mine quite a lot and has
made a lot of gold on the side that he probably

556
00:39:32,149 --> 00:39:36,438
lost a bulk of in recent days. He's very
noticeably frustrated by the circumstance.

557
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:43,207
LIAM: Rub my hands together and lay them on the
arm and say, "Our Father, who art in heaven--"

558
00:39:43,207 --> 00:39:45,266
MATT: "Oh, this religion shit."

559
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:52,833
LIAM: And however this game works, because I don't
know, I would like to heal him using--

560
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,045
MATT: Okay, make a faith check.

561
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:57,685
LIAM: Faith check, yeah.

562
00:39:57,685 --> 00:39:59,574
MATT: You add a d12.

563
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:02,723
LIAM: Oh my god, I never use 12s when we play
D&amp;D.

564
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:15,413
I think it's not that one. It's this big
round one, yeah. I'd like to use a chip. This is a

565
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,524
trait check, right?

566
00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:22,412
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to use a black chip. Go
ahead, toss it to me. Thank you.

567
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:24,118
LIAM: What do I roll? Both again?

568
00:40:24,118 --> 00:40:27,103
MATT: Just reroll the 12, yeah.

569
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:28,777
LIAM: Ten.

570
00:40:28,777 --> 00:40:38,960
MATT: Okay. That's with a raise, too. As you touch
your hands, "I understand... What the

571
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:46,292
"fuck is going on?" You can see as this light
envelops him. People in the room glance over with

572
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,052
a strange look in their eyes.

573
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:55,009
LIAM: I know. I questioned it at first as well.
But the Lord provides.

574
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:59,976
MATT: You see tears well up in his face. He's
like, "I believe--"

575
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:04,658
LIAM: You can give in and no man will judge you.

576
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:10,433
MATT: "I'm sorry. It's just really scary these days.
There's a lot going on. I've got to get out of

577
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:15,298
"here. I don't want them to see me cry." And he
stands up and stomps out of the Bella Union.

578
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:16,364
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

579
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:18,215
LIAM: Be with God, all right?

580
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:22,816
(laughter)

581
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:26,556
LIAM: Thus spaketh the Lord.

582
00:41:26,556 --> 00:41:31,825
MARISHA: Can I sit down in the corner and pull out
my tarot cards? Kind of shuffle them.

583
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:33,438
MATT: Sure. You--

584
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:37,711
MARISHA: Fortunes! Come and get your fortunes
told.

585
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:44,469
MATT: Make a general persuasion check for the room
if you could. You find your way back down. The

586
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:48,652
gentleman you guys saw who went upstairs, at this
point, has now exited from the upstairs room, down

587
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:52,691
the stairs. He gives a smile to the room and then
leaves out the front of the Bella Union as well.

588
00:41:52,691 --> 00:41:55,721
You follow suit, only but a few paces behind.

589
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,752
MARISHA: Four.

590
00:41:57,752 --> 00:42:03,823
MATT: You see at the far end of the room, a--

591
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:05,087
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

592
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,897
MATT: --rough-looking gentlemen that goes, "All
right! I got-- I'll go ahead and get myself a--"

593
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:10,123
(laughter)

594
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:13,959
LAURA: I just like the challenge of it.

595
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:16,211
MATT: Blue chip to everybody but me.

596
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:18,732
(cheering)

597
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:21,788
MARISHA: We love you, whoever you are. Oh jeez.

598
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:23,926
LAURA: Someday.

599
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:26,773
TRAVIS: You beautiful people.

600
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:34,263
MATT: The man walks over and says, "I don't really
believe in all this mumbo jumbo, but you look like

601
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:40,257
"a nice enough lady. Here." He passes you a dollar.
It's one little crinkled-up piece of paper.

602
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:44,062
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

603
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:50,117
MARISHA: All right. Can I do a notice check on
him? Can I get a profile on him?

604
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:51,448
MATT: Travis.

605
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:53,695
TRAVIS: Yes. (chip dropping on floor) Shit.

606
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:58,493
MATT: Blue. (laughter) It's going to be rerolls
forever.

607
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,479
MARISHA: Three. Not good at all.

608
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:06,018
MATT: You take your time putting the cards out in
front, and eventually you see his eyes start

609
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:10,542
wandering. He starts looking around. Loses
attention. He goes, "You know what? Keep the

610
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,941
"dollar. I learned my lesson." He stands up and
walks away.

611
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:14,395
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait!

612
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:17,860
MARISHA: It's fine. I made the dollar.

613
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,904
LAURA: You make money off of cards, and it's not
gambling?

614
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:26,466
MARISHA: How else am I supposed to make a living?
Yeah.

615
00:43:26,466 --> 00:43:31,343
MATT: It's at this point, as you guys are talking
about this, a gentleman who's been standing in the

616
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:38,753
far back with a long-brimmed, dark hat, a very
well-kept mustache and goatee, a long, dark coat

617
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:43,282
that ends about waist-height, walks over. You hear
the jangling of his spurs as he approaches.

618
00:43:43,282 --> 00:43:47,578
MARISHA: I mean, these cards. They're still gambling,
really. Cards are cards.

619
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:48,994
LAURA: Shh. It's a fancy guy.

620
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:53,468
MATT: "Good day, ma'am. I don't mean the bother you
much, but I couldn't help but notice you have a

621
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:55,603
"mind for the mystic."

622
00:43:55,603 --> 00:44:02,460
MARISHA: Of course, I do. I can't help but notice
that you have a mind for darkness, it seems.

623
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:09,853
LAURA: If you want her to read your fortune, I can
do that too. I'm real good at it! I charge less

624
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:13,017
than she does, but I do it even better!

625
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:22,851
MARISHA: We're friends. We're not competing. Very
well. Please, sit down.

626
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:24,174
MATT: "Let me introduce myself."

627
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:25,307
LAURA: All right, sure.

628
00:44:25,307 --> 00:44:26,431
MATT: "My name is Sheriff Bullock.

629
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,253
LAURA: Sheriff?

630
00:44:28,253 --> 00:44:30,447
MARISHA: Ooh. I'm so excited.

631
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:36,722
MATT: "There's been some strange things going on
in the town here and not a lot of people are

632
00:44:36,722 --> 00:44:41,660
"willing to offer help. The one priest we had that
was doing the best in this town has been ailing

633
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,582
"recently. I figure, maybe we can find folks with
other specializations."

634
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,197
TRAVIS: That's you.

635
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:48,350
LIAM: What is his name?

636
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,194
MATT: "What, the ailing fellow?"

637
00:44:51,194 --> 00:44:52,370
LIAM: Yes.

638
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:56,333
MATT: "Well, you think you can be of aid to him?"

639
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,949
LIAM: I definitely think I could provide aid to
him.

640
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,223
MATT: "All right."

641
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:01,771
LIAM: Is he poorly?

642
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:05,540
MATT: "He's been poorly for some time. A madness
is taking to him. You know, his eyes are starting

"to wander--"

TRAVIS: Madness!

645
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,868
MARISHA: What kind of madness do you speak of?

646
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:19,034
MATT: "Dementia. But that's not why I came here,
though. But we'll talk. All right, let me say that

647

"there's been a series of mysterious deaths at the
time."

MATT: Nearby table, guy who seems to have won kind of
shrinks down. "Sorry."

DONATION PROMPT: All right!

understanding."

(laughter)

one of these victims."

660

LIAM: Are we talking about an animal here,
Sheriff?

661
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:29,943
MATT: "Well, you'd have to talk to doc to get the real
report, but I say it's an animal. Many folks here

662
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:31,525
"think it's some sort of a bear."

663
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:35,051
LAURA: So what you're need is some kind of, like,
guns or something for hire?

MATT: "Maybe."

LAURA: All right.

TRAVIS: Your wife or your son was a victim?

MATT: "My wife."

668

TRAVIS: I'm so sorry to hear that.

669

MATT: "I'm watching my son, still. It happens.
Terribly. But that's something I've got to deal

670

"with, not you. Anyway, (sighs) if you could be of
some help, maybe look around, see if your mystic

jail."

674
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:08,300
LIAM: It's really getting to be a little rude.
Really.

675
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:17,428
MARISHA: It's very loud in here. You are looking for
mystic properties. Are you looking for a peek into

676
00:47:17,428 --> 00:47:19,836
your future, perhaps?

677
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:26,620
MATT: "No, I don't necessarily believe in that
stuff. It kind of worries me, honestly."

678
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,084
MARISHA: You don't have to believe. That's
what I always say.

679
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:36,600
MATT: There is a loud, calamitous crash sound as
the door that was partially closed at this point

680
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:42,510
smashes in front of you. Wood splinters go
streaming outward and you see what appears to be a

681
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:50,698
small fluff, a spherical bear form, roll in
and stop. Bright-eyed. A little bear cub.

682
00:47:50,764 --> 00:47:54,910
"Hold it! Kill it!" You see the guards
start pulling their guns out and start aiming it

683
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,503
down at the bear cub.

684
00:47:56,503 --> 00:47:57,925
MARISHA: No!

685
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:02,656
LIAM: Wait. It's a baby! Wait! We'll return it to
the wild.

686
00:48:02,656 --> 00:48:08,908
MATT: The Sheriff who's had his hand on the side
of his holster goes, "This is a wild animal."

687
00:48:09,044 --> 00:48:12,845
LAURA: Is this that damn creature that's been
tearing people up?

688
00:48:12,845 --> 00:48:16,404
MARISHA: This is not the creature. It's too
small!

689
00:48:16,404 --> 00:48:18,469
LIAM: It doesn't look like it can tear up a sack
of flour!

690
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:20,325
TRAVIS: It's a bit small...

691
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:25,789
LAURA: Maybe its mama is looking for him, tearing
people up to get to him. That's my--

692
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:27,491
LIAM: I'm going to crouch down and hold my hands
out.

693
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,109
LAURA: --investigational deduction.

694
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:33,410
MATT: You can go ahead and make a smarts check.

695
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,368
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

696
00:48:36,368 --> 00:48:38,392
(laughter)

697
00:48:38,392 --> 00:48:39,969
LAURA: That's right.

698
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:41,299
LIAM: Is that for her?

699
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:42,276
MATT: For you.

700
00:48:42,276 --> 00:48:43,238
LIAM: For me.

701
00:48:43,238 --> 00:48:46,013
LAURA: I got a three there.

702
00:48:46,013 --> 00:48:47,360
MATT: Do you want to reroll?

703
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,603
LAURA: Smarts. No.

704
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:50,187
(laughter)

705
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:53,663
MATT: This is a small bear. That's about as far as
you can get on that one.

706
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:55,181
LAURA: Hmm, it's a small bear.

707
00:48:55,254 --> 00:48:57,661
MATT: You go ahead and reach down for the bear.
The bear comes forward and sniffs you.

708
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:59,141
LIAM: Come here, nugget.

709
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:04,675
MATT: A small voice at the side of your ear goes,
"Your destination is elsewhere, Reverend." You

710
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,465
turn around; there's nothing there.

711
00:49:07,465 --> 00:49:09,855
TRAVIS: Second thoughts?

712
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:11,680
MATT: Kind of rub your ear.

713
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,223
MARISHA: What's wrong? This thing-- I don't know,
you frightened? Please.

714
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:17,200
MATT: The bear-- for you, Laura.

715
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,634
LAURA: (gasps) I caught it!

716
00:49:18,634 --> 00:49:22,098
MATT: The bear sees you and goes, (bear cub
sounds) and passes around you and goes straight

717
00:49:22,098 --> 00:49:25,617
over towards Stinky Jules and just starts rubbing
on your knee.

718
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:29,168
LAURA: Oh shit. What the fuck is this thing
doing?!

719
00:49:29,168 --> 00:49:34,062
MARISHA: He likes you! Oh, you've made a friend!

720
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:35,189
LAURA: All right, all right.

721
00:49:35,189 --> 00:49:37,471
MATT: It starts licking your hand, you're like
ugh. Bears.

722
00:49:37,471 --> 00:49:41,825
LAURA: I guess I pet it. I mean, if it wants to be
with me, I ain't going to stop it, you know, but--

723
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:44,613
LIAM: But bears?

724
00:49:44,613 --> 00:49:47,159
LAURA: I can't give you anything but
scraps, so you better get used to that.

725
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:49,121
TRAVIS: That's quite the responsibility, I hope
you know.

726
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:52,525
LAURA: You and me, kid.

727
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:57,519
MATT: A voice creeps in once again into your ear,
Reverend, but it's softer. It goes, "You're on the

728
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:02,682
"right path. Follow the leads. It will lead you to
your salvation."

729
00:50:02,682 --> 00:50:04,132
LIAM: Follow the leads?

730
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:11,065
MATT: "Follow the leads." And you reach over
again. There's no source of the voice. You've been

731
00:50:11,065 --> 00:50:15,237
a man of faith for a long time, but nothing's ever
spoken to you before.

732
00:50:15,237 --> 00:50:18,760
MARISHA: Do I notice if this is similar to my
talking monkey?

733
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,538
MATT: No, he's just looks like he's trying to feel
his ear.

734
00:50:20,538 --> 00:50:21,902
MARISHA: Okay.

735
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:24,143
MATT: So.

736
00:50:24,143 --> 00:50:25,991
LAURA: Do I get to keep the bear, though?

737
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:34,983
MATT: I don't know. How good are you with an
animal? The Sheriff goes, "I mean, respectfully,

738
00:50:34,983 --> 00:50:39,627
"there's a lot of weird shit going down in this
town right now. And a lot of it has happened in

739
00:50:39,627 --> 00:50:41,892
"the past five minutes since I walked in to talk to
you."

740
00:50:41,892 --> 00:50:43,214
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

741
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:47,675
MATT: "Sir! I warned you!" And the Sheriff goes
over and grabs the guy at the side table who's

742
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:52,446
been far too excited and screaming outward. He
says, "Sheriff, what are you doing?" He's like,

743
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:55,039
"I'm taking you down to go ahead and
clean up you-- I can smell the alcohol on your

744
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:59,465
"breath!" And he drags him out and you see as
Sheriff Bullock drags this poor card player out

745
00:50:59,465 --> 00:51:01,378
into the street past you guys.

746
00:51:01,378 --> 00:51:08,302
TRAVIS: Sheriff Bullock! Was there a particular
area that these attacks were taking place?

747
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:10,384
MATT: "Go talk to the doc! He's your best bet."

748
00:51:10,384 --> 00:51:11,472
TRAVIS: The doc, yes.

749
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:12,685
MATT: He drags him out.

750
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:16,243
TRAVIS: Perhaps we should go find this doc?

751
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:17,520
MARISHA: All right.

752
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:24,892
LIAM: Sheriff, can you point me towards your
reverend, your ailing reverend? What's his name again?

753
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:36,194
MATT: Trying to look it up right now, actually. I
didn't have his name written down. We're going to

754
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:39,799
find it real fast here, thanks to IMDB.

755
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:43,618
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, he's a real guy!

756
00:51:43,618 --> 00:51:52,134
MATT: "That'd be Reverend H. W. Smith. And the
doc's taking care of him right now, so that'd be

757
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:53,187
"your best bet."

758
00:51:53,187 --> 00:51:54,517
LIAM: Oh, one-stop shopping, everybody.

759
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:57,322
MATT: "Indeed. I'm going to take <i>this guy</i>--" And
the guy's still fighting him on the ground, going,

760
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:02,618
"Sheriff, put me down! Put me down!" We hit 60k,
guys!

761
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:04,284
(cheering)

762
00:52:04,284 --> 00:52:08,734
LAURA: Already? What the?

763
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:11,276
MARISHA and LAURA: All right!

764
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:14,054
MATT: Let me go ahead and say as part of that,
just to kind of pause here while you guys are

765
00:52:14,054 --> 00:52:19,737
deciding your next path, we're going to go ahead
and put up-- we're going to have the community decide

766
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:23,877
on an NPC name that's going to find its way into a future
game of Critical Role.

767
00:52:23,919 --> 00:52:25,348
TRAVIS: (gasps) Shut the fuck up. Are you
serious?

768
00:52:25,348 --> 00:52:30,247
MATT: So we're going to go with that one. If we
manage to hit 65k before this game's done, we'll

769
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:35,296
also have a boss creature of some kind that I'll
design with you guys in the near future as well.

770
00:52:35,296 --> 00:52:38,177
LIAM: Abjurist Pissbucket Shitwalla.

771
00:52:38,177 --> 00:52:39,572
LAURA: (laughs)

772
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:40,624
MARISHA: Shitwalla?

773
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,828
TRAVIS: We're going to need help!

774
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:48,804
MATT: So let's get keep that in mind. All right,
so Bullock drags the guy off in the distance. You

775
00:52:48,804 --> 00:52:55,213
all leave the Bella Union. Now it's mid-afternoon.
It's hot, even though it's winter time--

776
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,951
LAURA: It feels so good out here!

777
00:52:57,951 --> 00:53:00,970
TRAVIS: Could we find our way quickly, please?

778
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,491
MATT: --you have carts going by, the ground is
muddy itself from a recent rainfall. What do you

779
00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:08,690
guys want to do?

780
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,360
TRAVIS: Is there any horse shit on the ground?

781
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,058
MATT: There's plenty of horse shit.

782
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:13,782
TRAVIS: I really would care to stay out of it.

783
00:53:13,782 --> 00:53:16,031
LAURA: But before I go, I want to get some whisky
in a to-go cup.

784
00:53:16,031 --> 00:53:19,900
MATT: Fair enough. You go ahead and get yourself
some whisky and your canteen--

785
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,411
LAURA: That's my jug. That's right.

786
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:22,761
TRAVIS: A red Dixie cup.

787
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:24,908
LIAM: Is that a native word? Togo?

788
00:53:24,908 --> 00:53:27,137
LAURA: That's right. And I go find the doc.

789
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:30,210
MATT: Okay. Do you want to make a street smarts
roll? Go for it.

790
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,354
LAURA: Oh shit.

791
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:34,079
LIAM: The Sheriff pointed us there, didn't he?

792
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,818
MARISHA: To the doc?

793
00:53:35,818 --> 00:53:37,438
MATT: He said where the doc was and he was going
to point and he ended up--

794
00:53:37,438 --> 00:53:38,598
TRAVIS: Is it street wise or smarts?

795
00:53:38,598 --> 00:53:39,847
MATT: Street smarts. Sorry.

796
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:41,264
LAURA: What if we don't have that ability?

797
00:53:41,264 --> 00:53:42,530
TRAVIS: I got it!

798
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,442
LAURA: You have street ones?

799
00:53:44,442 --> 00:53:46,399
TRAVIS: I'm a journalist!

800
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:49,812
LAURA: Oh, that's true. Reroll that shit! We need
to find the doc!

801
00:53:49,812 --> 00:53:53,361
TRAVIS: Okay, I'd like to reroll with a black.

802
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:55,610
MATT: Go for it.

803
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,495
TRAVIS: That's better. Four!

804
00:53:58,495 --> 00:54:03,451
MATT: Four, okay! It takes you about an hour or so
asking around, but you do manage to lead the group

805
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:08,397
to the doc's place. As you come up to it, it's a
really, really simple-looking hovel that's jammed

806
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:13,019
against a stable, but everyone seems to point to
say where's the doc, and on the outside you do

807
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:17,532
see what appears to be a wooden carving of the
classic medical symbol over the doorway.

808
00:54:17,532 --> 00:54:23,078
TRAVIS: Yeah, Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece here. I
was just curious if the the doctor was within?

809
00:54:23,078 --> 00:54:24,658
(nervous laugh)

810
00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:25,858
MATT: You knock on the door?

811
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:26,857
TRAVIS: Yes.

812
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:29,934
MATT: A moment passes. All of a sudden, the door
opens and you see an eye peeking through a pair of

813
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:34,918
old, dirty glasses, big grey hair and a greyish
moustache goes, "Who the hell's coming to my door?"

814
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:37,361
TRAVIS: This one. She was quite rude.

815
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:39,032
LAURA: Hey there.

816
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:41,273
MATT: "I'm awfully busy, all right? We got
something I'm working on--"

817
00:54:41,273 --> 00:54:46,521
LAURA: I know. People getting hit, getting
attacked right? Shit like that?

818
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:49,283
MATT: "Yeah, I can't take any more patients for
now. All I have is work!"

819
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:52,050
LAURA: We don't got no patients for you. Shit. Pay
attention!

820
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:55,355
MARISHA: We were sent here by the sheriff. He told
us to find you.

821
00:54:55,355 --> 00:54:58,936
LIAM: You have a man of the cloth here as well and
I've come to help.

822
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:01,330
In ways that you are not accustomed to.

823
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:06,822
MATT: "Well, help is always welcome. Come on in,
come on in." He opens the door. You guys come

824
00:55:06,822 --> 00:55:10,526
inside, and there is a terrible smell. A terrible
smell-- to you, Liam, right there.

825
00:55:10,526 --> 00:55:12,026
LAURA: I don't smell anything.

826
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:15,598
MATT: Yeah, you're used to the scent. You come
inside and a smell of decay and death permeates

827
00:55:15,598 --> 00:55:17,246
the entire place.

828
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:19,048
LIAM: That's worse than you.

829
00:55:19,048 --> 00:55:27,098
MATT: You can see, across the way, there are two
tables with two current injured individuals, one

830
00:55:27,098 --> 00:55:32,338
of which seems to be a man who is wrapped up and
missing an arm and has been wrapped up, and he's

831
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:37,818
just rolling around in a feverish state. You also
see a man dressed in long, black robes who is

832
00:55:37,818 --> 00:55:45,477
humming to himself as he's writhing in place. One
arm is curled up across his torso. To the other

833
00:55:45,477 --> 00:55:52,200
side of the room, as you violently vomit into your
hat, you see what appear to be a number of tables

834
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,896
that have piles of viscera.

835
00:55:55,896 --> 00:55:58,939
LAURA: Piles of viscera.

836
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:07,269
MATT: Of what look to be once-human bodies that
are bloodied and flies are gathering.

837
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:10,478
LAURA: Gross. That's foul.

838
00:56:10,478 --> 00:56:15,693
MATT: The doctor turns around, now. You can see
him, sweaty, his long, crimped grey hair there.

839
00:56:15,693 --> 00:56:17,803
"All right. You said you're here to help."

840
00:56:17,803 --> 00:56:19,474
LIAM: Who's who here, doc?

841
00:56:19,474 --> 00:56:24,282
MATT: "This here's Gerald." He points to the guy
who's having a fever and says, "Had to amputate

842
00:56:24,282 --> 00:56:28,754
"his arm, 'cause the damn fucking fool got it torn
off in an accident with some machinery."

843
00:56:28,754 --> 00:56:33,693
LAURA: I go over and give him some whisky. The
feverish fella.

844
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:39,217
MATT: Okay. He's partially asleep, and as you pull
out the whisky, he goes, "What-- what--"

845
00:56:39,217 --> 00:56:42,939
LAURA: Have some whisky. Make you feel better.

846
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:45,862
MATT: "Okay." Puts up his arm and grabs the
whisky. It spills out a little bit. He's like,

847
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:47,324
(gulping).

848
00:56:47,324 --> 00:56:48,630
LAURA: All right, that's enough!

849
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:50,179
MATT: "Thank you."

850
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,042
LIAM: Doc, is this one worse off?

851
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:57,983
MATT: "He'll be fine, he's just making his way
through the fevers. I gave him some sedatives. He

852
00:56:57,983 --> 00:57:03,812
"should be okay. More worried about the Reverend.
Reverend Smith over there appears to have some

853
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:08,335
"sort of a brain tumor pushing on him. There's not
much we can do about that right now, unfortunately."

854
00:57:08,335 --> 00:57:09,771
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

855
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:12,683
MATT: The guy who's now drunk goes, "All right!"

856
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:14,695
(laughter)

857
00:57:14,695 --> 00:57:18,424
MATT: "That's some good whisky. Thank you." Passes
out at the table.

858
00:57:18,424 --> 00:57:23,178
LIAM: Let me see him. At the very least, I can
offer him the word of the Lord.

859
00:57:23,178 --> 00:57:26,069
MATT: You walk over to the Reverend. The
Reverend's sitting there, muttering to himself,

860
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:29,490
singing low under his breath. Chip of my choice.

861
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:31,795
TRAVIS: Oh, snap.

862
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:39,523
LIAM: Pick the shitty one. I place a hand on his
head with the thumb right here, right at the

863
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:43,208
temple. Reverend Smith.

864
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:50,647
MATT: "Yes, do you speak? The Lord, I can see the
light. The Lord has brought you to me. That's correct."

865
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:52,601
LIAM: It's not your time.

866
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,860
MATT: "When it's our time, it's time to go."

867
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:59,320
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know. It might be his time.
Just saying.

868
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,123
LIAM: Give me a minute.

869
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:07,460
MATT: "I appreciate your solace. You're a kind
soul, I can see. Thank you." And you can see one

870
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,533
eye's wandering off to the side, and the other
eye's just staring out before him. He feels your

871
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:13,685
presence, but he's in a rough place.

872
00:58:13,685 --> 00:58:19,891
LIAM: I pray to the Lord. I will heal this man.
Miracle.

873
00:58:19,891 --> 00:58:22,221
MATT: You spend two more power points.

874
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:23,699
LIAM: Okay, how many do I have, total?

875
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:24,781
MATT: Total is ten.

876
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:27,172
LIAM: Ten. So I've used four. Oh, I've used four
already?

877
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:30,121
MATT: You gained one back. You have three uses.

878
00:58:30,121 --> 00:58:31,855
LIAM: I still have to--

879
00:58:31,855 --> 00:58:34,696
MARISHA: Yeah, you can't take it back now, you'd
be that dick.

880
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:42,288
LIAM: No, because my hindrance is heroic. So I
can't divvy out. Yeah, I've got to, right now.

881
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:46,639
MATT: You gain one back as an hour has passed. You
gain one back every hour.

882
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:48,734
LIAM: So I have seven total, and I'm going now.

883
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,512
MATT: Go ahead and roll your faith check.

884
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:55,248
LAURA: While he's doing that, can I poke around
them piles of bodies and see--

885
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:56,763
TRAVIS: Why would you do that?

886
00:58:56,763 --> 00:58:58,212
LIAM: Ten.

887
00:58:58,212 --> 00:59:01,852
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check. A
ten? Okay.

888
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:03,394
LAURA: Is that, like, notice?

889
00:59:03,394 --> 00:59:04,933
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

890
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:10,247
LAURA: Does it take guts to look?

891
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:12,281
TRAVIS: You can do it, but you've got to roll a
minus two to it.

892
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:14,284
LAURA: Oh, what do I roll?

893
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:18,031
MATT: Roll a d4 minus two. And a d6.

894
00:59:18,031 --> 00:59:26,322
LAURA: Like a d6. I get to roll again, 'cause it's
six?

895
00:59:26,322 --> 00:59:27,855
MATT: Roll again.

896
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:31,660
LAURA: Oh, 11, there. While I'm poking through
them bodies.

897
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:41,314
MATT: 11 minus two, so it's a nine. All right, so
we'll get to you in just a moment. You feel-- this

898
00:59:41,314 --> 00:59:48,165
man is seriously ailing, and for a miracle that
can heal wounds, this is going to take some

899
00:59:48,165 --> 00:59:53,949
serious faith to try and push this through. Even
with what you have. You don't know if this is even

900
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:56,686
within your skill set.

901
00:59:56,686 --> 01:00:03,080
LIAM: So Liam is asking-- am I throwing dice? Yes,
I'm going to pray harder.

902
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,311
MATT: Okay, what are you going to do? Use some of
these chips, you have a lot of them!

903
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:10,664
LIAM: Wait, so I could use a chip to go higher
than I already did?

904
01:00:10,664 --> 01:00:13,036
MATT: You can use a red chip to add a d6.

905
01:00:13,036 --> 01:00:17,912
LIAM: Oh, add a d6. Well, now I can see that I
don't understand the rules, can I use this now to

906
01:00:17,912 --> 01:00:19,382
add a d6?

907
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,219
TRAVIS: I'm hurting. I'm hurting, y'all.

908
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:26,992
LIAM: One. Can I use another red chip?

909
01:00:26,992 --> 01:00:29,019
MATT: No, you get the one.

910
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:31,100
LIAM: One. Just a one. So that gets it to 11.

911
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,375
MATT: 11?

912
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:35,728
LIAM: All right!

913
01:00:35,728 --> 01:00:38,399
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

914
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:40,663
LIAM: See? Come on.

915
01:00:40,663 --> 01:00:43,464
MATT: The guy who's in a feverish state is
half-asleep and just--

916
01:00:43,464 --> 01:00:46,286
(laughter)

917
01:00:46,286 --> 01:00:52,473
MATT: And fine laudanum that the doc gave him to
calm him down, so he's going to be yell-shouting

918
01:00:52,526 --> 01:01:03,477
"All right!" for a while here. So. As you go ahead
and complete this miracle with the faith best you

919
01:01:03,477 --> 01:01:07,402
can beyond that, I'll let you use another chip if
you want to add the number to it.

920
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:10,194
LIAM: I have to. Come back to me, Reverend, come
back to me.

921
01:01:10,194 --> 01:01:12,229
MATT: Use another red chip to add another d6.

922
01:01:12,229 --> 01:01:18,444
LIAM: All right! All right!

923
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:25,233
MATT: All right. So what's it now? 13? I'll let
you do this for the sake of this. So, as you push

924
01:01:25,233 --> 01:01:33,171
through with the double-raise to your faith check
on this, you see as this bright, vibrant light

925
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:37,507
suddenly fills the room from one sunbeam
coming through the singular glass window striking

926
01:01:37,507 --> 01:01:42,949
you in the shoulder and enveloping the entirety of
Reverend Smith. All of a sudden, you in the

927
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:48,034
distance, as you're inspecting the corpses, you
can't help but glance over your shoulder, and you

928
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:54,564
watch as this ray of light envelops his body. As
it does, he lifts gently off the table two, three

929
01:01:54,564 --> 01:02:02,130
inches, and the doc goes, "What the fuck have you
brought into my place?" And he inspects, and as you

930
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:08,268
see the Reverend slowly turns over in place, his
eye corrects itself, a smile comes across him of

931
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:16,460
serene joy, and he's lowered down onto the table.
The light subsides, you take your hand away, and

932
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:24,494
he sits up in place, goes, "My lord. My mind-- my
thoughts are mine again."

933
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:28,493
LIAM: Welcome back, Reverend. The Lord will
abide.

934
01:02:28,493 --> 01:02:31,999
MATT: "The Lord is stronger in you than anyone I've ever
met."

935
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:34,765
LIAM: Please, don't thank me.

936
01:02:34,765 --> 01:02:40,943
MATT: He starts crying and gives you a big hug and
pulls you in. "There's no faith stronger than what

937
01:02:40,943 --> 01:02:42,146
"you've brought this day."

938
01:02:42,146 --> 01:02:49,931
LIAM: Take him by the hands. We all find ourselves
low and in place of trouble. It's always time to

939
01:02:49,931 --> 01:02:51,976
come back to his faith.

940
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:57,255
MATT: You've lost interest in this whole
circumstance about the bodies, and this is for

941
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:58,422
you, Travis.

942
01:02:58,422 --> 01:03:01,702
LAURA: What? Like a special note just for him?

943
01:03:01,702 --> 01:03:08,513
MATT: I'm not the only one that suffers. So you
get into this, and keen as you are, you've done

944
01:03:08,513 --> 01:03:13,833
some hunting in your time and you've seen some
wounds spent to various creatures that have been

945
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:22,876
mauled by individuals. You find specifically that,
one, it seems like a bear or at least something of

946
01:03:22,876 --> 01:03:29,692
a bear's size would have to have done this, but it's
wintertime. Bears usually aren't wandering. And

947
01:03:29,692 --> 01:03:36,953
the wounds here are thorough. Not killed something
and ate pieces of it. There is no indication that

948
01:03:36,994 --> 01:03:43,646
there has been portions of these bodies eaten, in
fact. They have just been killed and torn apart.

949
01:03:43,646 --> 01:03:46,128
LAURA: Just for no purpose.

950
01:03:46,128 --> 01:03:51,587
MATT: The doc, at this point, stunned by the whole
miracle that just transpired before him, walks

951
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:59,545
over to you and goes, "Here's what gets me. Each
of these bodies were found on the outskirts of

952
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:04,350
"town. Not deep in the woods. Some of these folks
weren't seen leaving."

953
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,804
LAURA: Like somebody wanting us to find them.

954
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:11,243
MATT: "I think some of these bodies were placed
after being killed."

955
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:12,759
TRAVIS: How ghastly!

956
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:17,685
MATT: "I don't know if these people were outside
of the town when they were killed, even. So I'm

957
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:19,834
"confused, just as you are, about this."

958
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:27,082
LAURA: So you think that whatever did this could
actually be staying inside of this town?

959
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:30,550
MATT: "Or at least, whatever did this is working
with someone within the town."

960
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:34,946
MARISHA: Have you noticed any suspicious activity
in the town?

961
01:04:34,946 --> 01:04:39,305
MATT: "Have you been to this town for long? It's
full of suspicious activity!"

962
01:04:39,305 --> 01:04:41,423
MARISHA: We just arrived this morning. I don't
know.

963
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:46,182
MATT: "Fucking damn it. This whole town's full of
cocksuckers, and I don't know how to separate the

964
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:50,356
"good from the bad. I wouldn't even believe what
you're saying if this guy didn't come in here and

965
01:04:50,356 --> 01:04:55,291
"fucking prove that God exists to me as an atheist.
I'm having a lot going in my head right now."

966
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,990
LIAM: Hallelujah.

967
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:03,408
MATT: "Halle-fucking-lujah. If you want to help,
find out what the shit did this! I need a drink."

968
01:05:03,408 --> 01:05:06,222
And he goes over and grabs the bottle of laudanum
next to the guy.

969
01:05:06,222 --> 01:05:07,515
TRAVIS: Oh, no, no!

970
01:05:07,515 --> 01:05:11,236
MATT: Who he was helping. "Don't you 'no' or shush
me. I know what I need."

971
01:05:11,236 --> 01:05:13,382
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh, good gracious.

972
01:05:13,382 --> 01:05:15,093
LAURA: Don't be stingy.

973
01:05:15,093 --> 01:05:19,965
MATT: "Fuckin'--" Make a persuasion check.

974
01:05:19,965 --> 01:05:22,088
TRAVIS: Stinky Jules.

975
01:05:22,088 --> 01:05:24,232
LAURA: Hold on, I'm about to drink.

976
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:28,203
MATT: Two red chips to the Reverend.

977
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:31,753
LIAM: Man down!

978
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:36,497
LAURA: Wait, zero, but I'm going to add a red
chip, so I can get some of that.

979
01:05:36,497 --> 01:05:38,291
MATT: And a black chip to you, Sydney.

980
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:43,905
LAURA: So five. Yeah, but here's my chip that I
just used to get that.

981
01:05:43,905 --> 01:05:48,795
MATT: He goes, "One sip. I ain't got a lot of
this."

982
01:05:48,795 --> 01:05:50,611
LIAM: Wait, can I make a persuasion check on her?

983
01:05:50,611 --> 01:05:52,211
MATT: You may.

984
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:54,612
LIAM: Yeah, I'd like to. Juniper.

985
01:05:54,612 --> 01:05:58,641
LAURA: Don't you fucking call me Juniper! I don't
know you.

986
01:05:58,641 --> 01:06:00,636
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

987
01:06:00,636 --> 01:06:03,246
LIAM: Technically, you do know me. Biblically.

988
01:06:03,246 --> 01:06:05,867
LAURA: Oh, that's true. Did you check your junk?

989
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:09,076
(laughter)

990
01:06:09,076 --> 01:06:11,208
LIAM: You don't want to go down that hole.

991
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:16,278
LAURA: I think you already went down it, if you
get my meaning.

992
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:21,507
LIAM: I'm not good with comedy. This is very
awkward. I just don't want to see you going over

993
01:06:21,507 --> 01:06:26,292
an edge you can't come back from. What do I roll
to stop Laura Bailey from having drugs?

994
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:28,503
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

995
01:06:28,503 --> 01:06:31,583
LIAM: Yeah, okay. Okay, all right, it's not the
worst.

996
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:36,175
(laughter)

997
01:06:36,175 --> 01:06:43,128
LIAM: Four, both four, and I will add five, so a
total of nine.

998
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:52,714
MATT: Total of nine? I want you to go ahead and--
I'd say for this, roll a spirit.

999
01:06:52,714 --> 01:07:02,389
LAURA: Spirit? It's going to be hard for me to
beat, seeing as how I've only got a d6 here. Five.

1000
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:04,381
MATT: Okay. You going to add anything to that?

1001
01:07:04,381 --> 01:07:10,407
LAURA: Yeah, all right, I'll add a black chip-- no,
no, no, I don't want to reroll it, I've got to add

1002
01:07:10,407 --> 01:07:20,122
to it, and I'm out of my colors here. All right,
I'll add a red. What's that? Nine?

1003
01:07:20,122 --> 01:07:21,936
LIAM: Yeah, so equal numbers.

1004
01:07:21,936 --> 01:07:24,827
MATT: Both of you guys roll a d6.

1005
01:07:24,827 --> 01:07:26,191
LIAM: Dance-off.

1006
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:28,565
TRAVIS: Same time, do it same time.

1007
01:07:28,565 --> 01:07:31,110
LAURA and LIAM: One, two, three.

1008
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:32,299
LIAM: Six!

1009
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:33,780
LAURA: Damn it!

1010
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:39,414
MATT: Normally, no one could keep you from a sip
of laudanum, but watching the miracles that

1011
01:07:39,414 --> 01:07:44,628
transpire around this bright and bushy-faced
gentleman, you think maybe you should drink this

1012
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:47,388
when he's not around, and you gently give it back
to the doctor.

1013
01:07:47,388 --> 01:07:52,921
LAURA: Fine. I wasted a chip to talk him into
giving it to me in the first place.

1014
01:07:52,921 --> 01:07:58,258
LIAM: Listen, I'm going to give this to you. It's
a bar of soap, it's my last one. Use it.

1015
01:07:58,258 --> 01:08:02,324
MATT: "I appreciate you all having your
conversations, but if you could do it outside, I

1016
01:08:02,324 --> 01:08:03,601
"got business to tend to."

1017
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:05,673
LAURA: Oh, that tastes like shit! What is this?

1018
01:08:05,673 --> 01:08:09,416
LIAM: It doesn't go in your mouth. You know what
soap is, right?

1019
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:13,420
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's made of lye, it's for cleaning
yourself with.

1020
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:17,252
MATT: As he starts pushing you guys outside of the
place, and you get outside, before he closes the

1021
01:08:17,252 --> 01:08:23,843
door, he goes, "Just a word, I don't know if this
will help much, but each of those that were killed

1022
01:08:23,843 --> 01:08:28,401
"inside here were plot owners in gold and silver
veins."

1023
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:30,052
TRAVIS: You don't say.

1024
01:08:30,052 --> 01:08:31,395
MATT: "Except for the last two."

1025
01:08:31,395 --> 01:08:32,514
LAURA: What were they?

1026
01:08:32,514 --> 01:08:36,556
MATT: "Hugh and Kilmer. The ones you were looking
at. They were under the employ of Al Swearengen in

1027
01:08:36,556 --> 01:08:41,479
"the Gem Saloon. Now, get out!" And he slams the
door behind you.

1028
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:43,229
LIAM: The video game developer?

1029
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:46,807
(laughter)

1030
01:08:46,807 --> 01:08:51,083
LAURA: Shit. Sounds like it was rich folks getting
killed in this town.

1031
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:53,092
TRAVIS: Quite glad to be out of there.

1032
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:57,258
MARISHA: I can think of many reasons to kill rich
people. Many.

1033
01:08:57,258 --> 01:09:02,459
LAURA: Who should we talk to to find out what kind
of creatures have been living in this city?

1034
01:09:02,459 --> 01:09:10,472
MATT: You hear a voice creep in the back of your
ear, Liam, once again, that says, "The only path

1035
01:09:10,472 --> 01:09:18,513
"to goodness is to find who murdered these people.
Follow the trail. Be a hero."

1036
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:26,572
LIAM: Can I pray for guidance to know if this is a
devil or an angel talking to me?

1037
01:09:26,572 --> 01:09:28,689
MATT: Roll a faith check.

1038
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:46,582
LIAM: I have to. I'll be screwed later, but I have
to. Shit. Two and two, shit. Shit! Four.

1039
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:51,722
MATT: It's hard to tell. You've had a lot of
miracle stuff happen recently, so you figure this

1040
01:09:51,722 --> 01:09:54,072
is probably an angel sent from God, but it's hard
to tell.

1041
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:56,163
LIAM: Here are two that I've used.

1042
01:09:56,163 --> 01:10:05,170
TRAVIS: Salty Jules, I was wondering, would you
mind if in my notepad I did a small sketch of your

1043
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:07,946
bear cub? I do fancy him so.

1044
01:10:07,946 --> 01:10:09,660
LAURA: Oh, is it still following us?

1045
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:13,754
TRAVIS: Yes, yes. Would you mind if I looked after
him and maybe did some drawings?

1046
01:10:13,754 --> 01:10:17,347
LAURA: Feel free. No one's stopping you.

1047
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:19,622
MARISHA: You want to keep the bear?

1048
01:10:19,622 --> 01:10:23,095
TRAVIS: Yes, I would love to look after him, if
that's all right. I just--

1049
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:29,334
MARISHA: I foresee this bear possibly killing you
in your future, but you know what, go for it. You

1050
01:10:29,334 --> 01:10:31,378
have a good time with him. You have a good time.

1051
01:10:31,378 --> 01:10:35,204
LAURA: You've gotta be strong when you're raising
such a creature, now.

1052
01:10:35,204 --> 01:10:36,534
TRAVIS: All right.

1053
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:43,571
LAURA: So make sure you discipline him, but also
give him lots of love and whisky, but no

1054
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:45,674
chocolate, I hear that's bad for him.

1055
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,921
TRAVIS: Whisky, love, whisky, and chocolate.

1056
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:49,238
LAURA: No chocolate.

1057
01:10:49,238 --> 01:10:56,026
MATT: The bear, which is nuzzling under your hand,
Stinky Jules, and is like, just licking.

1058
01:10:56,026 --> 01:10:58,153
LAURA: What can I say? He just loves the way I
smell.

1059
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:01,504
TRAVIS: I hope he'll be as affectionate with me.
May I?

1060
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:04,115
LAURA: You can try.

1061
01:11:04,115 --> 01:11:06,717
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you. And I would like to grab
the bear and try to cuddle it.

1062
01:11:06,717 --> 01:11:08,722
MATT: It begins to growl as soon as you get
close.

1063
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:11,707
TRAVIS: No, no! Did you give it a name?

1064
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:14,907
LAURA: Trinket.

1065
01:11:14,907 --> 01:11:22,871
TRAVIS: Trinket. Oh yes. Like a little cork.
Hello, Trinket. It is your Uncle Sydney.

1066
01:11:22,871 --> 01:11:29,134
MATT: Bites at your hand. What is your parry?

1067
01:11:29,134 --> 01:11:31,015
TRAVIS: My parry is six.

1068
01:11:31,015 --> 01:11:46,539
MATT: Six. All right. So the bear bites out
towards your hand, doing seven points of damage.

1069
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:49,338
What's your toughness?

1070
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:51,695
TRAVIS: My toughness is five.

1071
01:11:51,695 --> 01:12:02,224
MARISHA: Hang on, wait! I'm going to use my snake
oil salesman to contest your roll. You can do

1072
01:12:02,224 --> 01:12:05,710
that, right? Your roll on the bear, the bear
attacking him?

1073
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,935
MATT: It's not snake oil salesman you're referring
to.

1074
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:10,651
MARISHA: Oh sorry, my knack of the seventh sun
ability.

1075
01:12:10,651 --> 01:12:16,359
MATT: I didn't use a fate chip. You can negate
me using one. You can't force me to reroll. When I

1076
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:17,929
use a chip, you can be like, nope.

1077
01:12:17,929 --> 01:12:19,655
LAURA: Do you announce when you use a chip?

1078
01:12:19,655 --> 01:12:20,711
MATT: Yeah.

1079
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:25,545
LIAM: You don't know the rules you learned
yesterday?

1080
01:12:25,545 --> 01:12:34,281
MATT: So the bear bites down on your hand. You
pull back. You're considered shaken for the moment.

1081
01:12:34,281 --> 01:12:36,073
TRAVIS: I'm quite shaken!

1082
01:12:36,073 --> 01:12:37,940
MATT: But the bear's still so fucking cute!

1083
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:47,269
TRAVIS: He's so lovely. Quite a voracious little
energetic one. I'm still-- my god. Can you see the flesh?

1084
01:12:47,269 --> 01:12:51,201
LAURA: I wonder if this little beast can lead us
to another beast?

1085
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,902
MARISHA: Good, good.

1086
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:55,141
LAURA: I mean, it is a baby, I don't know.

1087
01:12:55,141 --> 01:12:56,941
TRAVIS: Quite cute.

1088
01:12:56,941 --> 01:13:00,943
MATT: Just licks a little bit of blood off of its
teeth and grins at you.

1089
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,663
MARISHA: We could probably use him as bait.

1090
01:13:02,663 --> 01:13:14,739
LAURA: That's true, we could. It is so hard to
fight the motherly instinct. I know I'm not, but

1091
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:16,787
it's real hard to fight it!

1092
01:13:16,787 --> 01:13:18,030
MATT: What's the plan now?

1093
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:22,780
TRAVIS: Well, perhaps we should go to this Mr.
Swearengen's place, see what the people in his

1094
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,432
employ were actually up to.

1095
01:13:24,432 --> 01:13:28,034
LAURA: That's smart. You're smart!

1096
01:13:28,034 --> 01:13:29,856
TRAVIS: Thank you, yes, I do a lot of reading.

1097
01:13:29,856 --> 01:13:32,752
LAURA: Well, lead the way, Smarts.

1098
01:13:32,752 --> 01:13:34,565
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

1099
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:38,107
MATT: You actually saw the Gem Saloon. It's not
too far from the Bella Union.

1100
01:13:38,107 --> 01:13:41,093
TRAVIS: This way. Mind the horseshit.

1101
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:42,990
LAURA: I step right through the horseshit.

1102
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:45,917
MATT: She does. Right up to the ankle.

1103
01:13:45,917 --> 01:13:47,593
TRAVIS: To each their own.

1104
01:13:47,593 --> 01:13:54,265
MATT: You eventually make your way towards the Gem
Saloon. As you walk up, there is piano being

1105
01:13:54,265 --> 01:13:58,615
played, but unlike the Bella Union, it's not quite
as fanciful and the interior's a little more

1106
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:07,230
dreary. As you step inside, you can see a few
patrons around, you can see a few of the female

1107
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:11,968
workers of the establishment who are all leaning
in the back corner in various states of undress,

1108
01:14:11,968 --> 01:14:15,474
but all look hot and not really into it at the
moment.

1109
01:14:15,474 --> 01:14:20,603
TRAVIS: Reverend, avert your eyes. Hello!

1110
01:14:20,603 --> 01:14:26,640
MATT: As you walk in and say that, you see across
the way, a man with a big, black beard and long

1111
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:33,571
hair, little bowler cap on with a rifle across his
shoulder and a white shirt with a single strap

1112
01:14:33,571 --> 01:14:37,709
over for his overalls, looks over and starts
walking towards you with his rifle in his hand.

1113
01:14:37,709 --> 01:14:45,783
Just goes, (Clarota voice) "What brings you here
to the Gem Saloon? Sorry, I got punched in the

1114
01:14:45,783 --> 01:14:48,298
"throat and it's healing."

1115
01:14:48,298 --> 01:14:52,527
TRAVIS: That sounds awful. We may have someone
that might be able to help you. My name is Sydney

1116
01:14:52,527 --> 01:14:53,782
Hopkins Trivelpiece.

1117
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:56,929
MATT: "What you cocksuckers doing here in the Gem?
What you looking for?"

1118
01:14:56,929 --> 01:15:02,815
LAURA: Them bodies in the doc's place. They came
from you?

1119
01:15:02,815 --> 01:15:06,919
MATT: "They're a couple men we lost, yes, but
that's not our problem."

1120
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:15,563
LAURA: I mean, but why? They been teared up by a
beast or something. Figure out what that is? You

1121
01:15:15,563 --> 01:15:18,257
seen any beasts around here, outside of this
little bear?

1122
01:15:18,257 --> 01:15:22,174
MATT: "I've seen no fucking beasts. If you're here
to drink, fucking get in here. Otherwise, I need

1123
01:15:22,174 --> 01:15:23,731
"you to step off."

1124
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:26,047
LAURA: All right. I go up to the bar and get some
drinks going.

1125
01:15:26,047 --> 01:15:28,420
TRAVIS: If you don't mind, sir, what is your
name?

1126
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,920
MATT: Looks at you for a second. Make a persuasion
check.

1127
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,081
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1128
01:15:34,081 --> 01:15:37,915
LAURA: That's good!

1129
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:43,535
TRAVIS: That's not bad. That's balls. I'm going to
spend a reroll.

1130
01:15:43,535 --> 01:15:48,215
LAURA: That's the eight you reroll.

1131
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:54,340
TRAVIS: Oh, I do reroll the eight if I use a black
chip? Oh, thank god. Hey! Eight!

1132
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,622
MATT: Roll again.

1133
01:15:55,622 --> 01:15:57,310
TRAVIS: 15!

1134
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:04,010
MATT: Gives you a look-over and his demeanor
shifts, changes again, and he goes, "Sorry. Just

1135
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:14,719
"doing my job. Name's Dan. Yeah, Doherty." Shakes
your hand for a second. "So right now you know

1136
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,954
"who's boss."

1137
01:16:15,954 --> 01:16:18,332
TRAVIS: My writing hand. Dan Doherty.

1138
01:16:18,332 --> 01:16:24,837
MATT: "So if you want a drink, over to the bar.
Otherwise, sit down. Listen to some music. Buy

1139
01:16:24,837 --> 01:16:27,146
"yourself some pussy. Doesn't matter to me."

1140
01:16:27,146 --> 01:16:28,804
TRAVIS: Oh, pussy, yes.

1141
01:16:28,804 --> 01:16:35,859
LIAM: Dan, if you've got means here to boil some
water and some whisky that you've got, I could

1142
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:42,147
probably help you out with your throat, if you
like. A little background in medicine. Your choice.

1143
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:45,183
LAURA: I like the way you sound, Dan!

1144
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:50,460
MATT: He gives you a look. "You ain't look like
you ever suffered more than suckling your mother's

1145
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,838
"tit, and I don't trust anyone who don't drink, nor
anyone who don't have to shave."

1146
01:16:54,838 --> 01:16:56,398
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

1147
01:16:56,398 --> 01:17:00,082
MATT: "That's what I said." He goes and high-fives
the guy at the table next to him, this older,

1148
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:05,165
drunk fella who heard the whole conversation and
is laughing at your rather mousey--

1149
01:17:05,165 --> 01:17:10,542
LIAM: Dan, I've seen the brains pour out of a
man's head on the field of battle on the Eastern

1150
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:15,943
coast. You can have my help if you want, or you
can suffer.

1151
01:17:15,943 --> 01:17:24,304
MATT: "I'll take suffer. I prefer to heal on my
own. The proper way. None of your fucking

1152
01:17:24,304 --> 01:17:30,644
"godmongering types here saying that the word can
help." And he spins around, keeps an eye over his

1153
01:17:30,644 --> 01:17:34,184
shoulder, mistrusting towards you, with the rifle
still at his side.

1154
01:17:34,184 --> 01:17:35,901
LIAM: God bless, Dan.

1155
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:41,310
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, could I ask you all a question?
I've always been quite curious about the

1156
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:48,034
employment of the American whore. I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind if I went and interviewed one

1157
01:17:48,034 --> 01:17:54,662
for my journal. Perhaps you could do me the
queries here, and I might leave you for a moment?

1158
01:17:54,662 --> 01:17:58,842
MARISHA: Are you asking permission to go speak to
whore?

1159
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,340
TRAVIS: Yes.

1160
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,737
MARISHA: If you want to go fuck whore, go fuck
whore. You don't have to ask permission.

1161
01:18:04,737 --> 01:18:06,464
LAURA: There's plenty around.

1162
01:18:06,464 --> 01:18:12,480
MARISHA: Don't try and say you're interviewing
whore when we know what you want.

1163
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:20,722
MATT: The voice returns and goes, "Men and women
are born every day through a union of others.

1164
01:18:20,722 --> 01:18:26,662
"Go. Be merry. Touch. Feel."

1165
01:18:26,662 --> 01:18:33,869
TRAVIS: Just curious, Padre. I don't know quite
what your denomination is--

1166
01:18:33,869 --> 01:18:35,377
LIAM: Protestant.

1167
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:40,991
TRAVIS: Oh, Protestant, lovely. So would you care
to perhaps get an adjoining room? Just because I'm

1168
01:18:40,991 --> 01:18:44,338
afraid I'll feel rather exposed upstairs.

1169
01:18:44,338 --> 01:18:49,053
LIAM: I'm not really sure what you're asking? Are
you asking me to babysit while you--

1170
01:18:49,053 --> 01:18:56,098
TRAVIS: No, just perhaps join me for a trip down
the old lane?

1171
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:57,614
LAURA: Was that a blink?

1172
01:18:57,614 --> 01:18:59,534
(laughter)

1173
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,131
LAURA: Did you just blink at him?

1174
01:19:01,131 --> 01:19:02,693
TRAVIS: It was a double-blink.

1175
01:19:02,693 --> 01:19:06,073
LAURA: So you want one of them whores?

1176
01:19:06,073 --> 01:19:07,491
TRAVIS: To speak to one, yes.

1177
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:18,382
LAURA: I pull up the closest whore to me. Hey.
Which one of you are the least itchy? (clicks tongue)

1178
01:19:18,382 --> 01:19:27,849
MATT: They all look at each other. They're all
giving you a very, very curious look, and they all

1179
01:19:27,849 --> 01:19:35,076
put their hand out like, "Honey. We're all clean.
The doctor takes care of us. You going to pay or not?"

1180
01:19:35,076 --> 01:19:40,231
LAURA: They're all clean. I don't believe a word
she says, but they're all clean.

1181
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:42,053
MARISHA: It's only matter of time.

1182
01:19:42,053 --> 01:19:46,146
TRAVIS: Yes, I would like to acquire one whore,
please.

1183
01:19:46,146 --> 01:19:48,770
MATT: "Ten dollars, take your choice."

1184
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:56,883
TRAVIS: Ten dollars. Is that a going rate in the
States? Ten dollars it is, yes. Ten dollars.

1185
01:19:56,883 --> 01:20:02,394
MATT: She takes you by the hand and starts leading
you up the stairs.

1186
01:20:02,394 --> 01:20:05,719
TRAVIS: Quiet room. Hopefully secluded from the
others.

1187
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:08,348
LAURA: He wants to interview you!

1188
01:20:08,348 --> 01:20:12,390
MATT: He gets closed behind the door. Three of you
guys, what are you doing?

1189
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:23,595
LAURA: I go and ask one of them whores about the
guys that are dead. I want to find a whore and ask

1190
01:20:23,595 --> 01:20:28,319
her about-- (laughs) Ask her about them bodies I
found over at Doc's place.

1191
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:34,204
MATT: You find a woman, a brunette, rosy make-up
cheeks who's sitting at a table, just fanning

1192
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:37,448
herself off in this strangely muggy warm day in
the middle of the winter.

1193
01:20:37,448 --> 01:20:40,411
LAURA: Oh, yeah, it's hot, isn't it?

1194
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:45,671
MATT: "You're telling me. This day's been all
sorts of muggy. How can I help you?"

1195
01:20:45,671 --> 01:20:49,241
LAURA: Hey, I saw them bodies over at Doc's place.
Tored up.

1196
01:20:49,241 --> 01:20:51,065
MATT: "I don't want to talk about that."

1197
01:20:51,065 --> 01:20:57,132
LAURA: Wait, wait, don't-- I just, did you know
those dudes? Those guys?

1198
01:20:57,132 --> 01:21:15,133
MATT: "Kilmer was one of the nicer fellas who
worked here at the Gem. He, well. Sad to hear that

1199
01:21:15,133 --> 01:21:16,615
"he met a weird fate."

1200
01:21:16,615 --> 01:21:18,401
LAURA: And he actually worked here?

1201
01:21:18,401 --> 01:21:19,873
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

1202
01:21:19,873 --> 01:21:22,820
LAURA: All right, that's good to know. What about
that other fella?

1203
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:29,489
MATT: "Hugh worked here as well, but I'm honestly
kind of glad Hugh got what he had coming."

1204
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:36,209
LAURA: Hugh. He's a fucker, wasn't he? All right,
when did they go missing?

1205
01:21:36,209 --> 01:21:41,596
MATT: "I don't rightfully know. You'd have to ask
Mr. Schwerenger about that."

1206
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:43,469
LAURA: Where's Mr. Schwerenger?

1207
01:21:43,469 --> 01:21:46,864
MATT: She looks up, and you can see at the top of
the stairs, it curls around and there's an office

1208
01:21:46,864 --> 01:21:48,748
with a closed door on the second floor.

1209
01:21:48,748 --> 01:21:53,642
LAURA: We allowed to go up there? That looks like
lock-and-key sort of shit.

1210
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:59,445
MATT: She points over to-- you see Dan at the
corner with his rifle, keeping a very close look

1211
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:01,695
on you. "You got to talk to him."

1212
01:22:01,695 --> 01:22:07,107
LAURA: Talk to Dan? All right. Hey. Thanks for the
help, there.

1213
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:09,970
MATT: Holds her hand out.

1214
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:14,245
LAURA: Aw, shit. I hand her some money.

1215
01:22:14,245 --> 01:22:16,293
MATT: Okay. Takes it.

1216
01:22:16,293 --> 01:22:21,412
MARISHA: Sudis actually wanted to go talk to Dan.

1217
01:22:21,412 --> 01:22:26,355
MATT: Okay. So as you turn around, Sudis has
walked up to Dan. As you approach, he has the gun

1218
01:22:26,355 --> 01:22:31,726
at his side, and he begins to pull back the
trigger. "Can I help you?"

1219
01:22:31,726 --> 01:22:36,441
MARISHA: How do you say name again?

1220
01:22:36,441 --> 01:22:46,139
MATT: "Dan. Dan Doherty. That's far enough. You
come any closer, I'm going to go ahead and take

1221
01:22:46,139 --> 01:22:47,880
"your eye out."

1222
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,346
LAURA: Oh, don't mind her. She's just a fortune
teller.

1223
01:22:50,346 --> 01:22:52,120
LIAM: (hiccups)

1224
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,087
LAURA: You all right there, Rev?

1225
01:22:54,087 --> 01:22:59,053
MATT: He pulls a small black feather out of his
mouth after the hiccup and is confused by the whole thing.

1226
01:22:59,053 --> 01:23:15,566
LIAM: I suppose it is a little funny. (hiccups)
We're all tested. Each in our own way.

1227
01:23:15,566 --> 01:23:23,393
MARISHA: Looking at the aura, the energy
surrounding you, I don't think you'd pull that

1228
01:23:23,393 --> 01:23:25,270
trigger, would you, Dan?

1229
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:28,196
LAURA: I think he'd pull it there, hon.

1230
01:23:28,196 --> 01:23:30,518
MATT: Make a notice check.

1231
01:23:30,518 --> 01:23:40,154
MARISHA: What do I do? Five.

1232
01:23:40,154 --> 01:23:46,921
MATT: Five? He would definitely pull that trigger.
You get the sense he's pulled a lot of triggers,

1233
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:52,706
and he's aiming right at you. "One more step."

1234
01:23:52,706 --> 01:24:01,773
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I just thought you might like
a little bit of insight into your future. I can

1235
01:24:01,773 --> 01:24:04,813
see great potential in you, Dan.

1236
01:24:04,813 --> 01:24:09,154
MATT: "I don't want any of this. Too many fucking
weird things happen in this town. Don't want any

1237
01:24:09,154 --> 01:24:13,072
"of your god damn magical bullshit. Get the fuck
out of the Gem before I shoot your eye out--"

1238
01:24:13,072 --> 01:24:14,421
LAURA: Hey, hey! Sue, Sue.

1239
01:24:14,421 --> 01:24:22,059
MARISHA: All right. I was going to save your life,
but have it your way. Oh, and watch your back.

1240
01:24:22,059 --> 01:24:27,185
LAURA: She's scary as fuck.

1241
01:24:27,185 --> 01:24:31,775
MATT: "Don't trust them gypsy types at all."

1242
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:35,071
LAURA: Hey, Dan.

1243
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:41,468
MATT: "What you want? You might need someone. Go
on."

1244
01:24:41,468 --> 01:24:53,786
LAURA: Your employer up at the top of them stairs.
How do I get to talk to him?

1245
01:24:53,786 --> 01:25:01,128
MATT: "No one talks to Al unless they get
permission. What you want to talk to him about?"

1246
01:25:01,128 --> 01:25:03,848
LAURA: How do I get permission to talk--

1247
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:06,946
MATT: "Tell me what you need for him, I'll talk to
him, and he'll tell you no."

1248
01:25:06,946 --> 01:25:13,907
LAURA: No, I want to help you kill the
motherfucker that killed your motherfuckers. Now

1249
01:25:13,907 --> 01:25:15,642
you seem capable.

1250
01:25:15,642 --> 01:25:17,055
MATT: "Is he all right?"

1251
01:25:17,055 --> 01:25:19,886
LAURA: He's done some crazy shit today.

1252
01:25:19,886 --> 01:25:24,943
MATT: "I can see. You're supposed to cook the bird
first, asshole!"

1253
01:25:24,943 --> 01:25:28,394
LIAM: What?

1254
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:31,461
MATT: "It's the throat thing, I'm sorry."

1255
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:33,783
LIAM: I know, I can-- never mind.

1256
01:25:33,783 --> 01:25:40,816
MATT: "Sit the fuck down. You get the fuck out of
the Gem, or I swear to fucking god, I'm going to shoot."

1257
01:25:40,816 --> 01:25:46,754
LIAM: I take a step in front of the gypsy. Dan.

1258
01:25:46,754 --> 01:25:54,263
MATT: "You got until three to calm your friends
the fuck down, or I'm going to go ahead and take

1259
01:25:54,263 --> 01:25:55,567
"'em both out."

1260
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:59,541
MARISHA: I'm quite calm. Do I look aroused? I
don't--

1261
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:03,889
LAURA: Calm down, you guys that are really revved
up right now.

1262
01:26:03,889 --> 01:26:06,405
LIAM: I'd like to reach my hand down to--

1263
01:26:06,405 --> 01:26:08,030
LAURA: Down to what?

1264
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:09,940
LIAM: --Stinky Jules' revolver.

1265
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:15,242
LAURA: Hey, get your fucking hand off my gun.
Don't fucking touch my gun.

1266
01:26:15,242 --> 01:26:16,955
MATT: Reach for her revolver?

1267
01:26:16,955 --> 01:26:20,339
LIAM: No, not to take it, to cast Smite on it.

1268
01:26:20,339 --> 01:26:25,802
TRAVIS: Sometimes reaching's all that needs to be
done.

1269
01:26:25,802 --> 01:26:28,638
LIAM: Give her the ol' reach-around.

1270
01:26:28,638 --> 01:26:32,144
LAURA: You're going to reach for my gun when a
motherfucker's pointing a gun at you?

1271
01:26:32,144 --> 01:26:36,519
MATT: So Travis, first off, while we're in this
moment, as time has passed, I would like for you

1272
01:26:36,519 --> 01:26:43,641
to go ahead and roll a spirit check.

1273
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:53,022
TRAVIS: That's a four. Four.

1274
01:26:53,022 --> 01:26:54,840
LAURA: Add something to it!

1275
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,939
MATT: You got chips, guys, use 'em.

1276
01:26:57,939 --> 01:26:59,777
LAURA: I know, we've got so many.

1277
01:26:59,777 --> 01:27:02,442
TRAVIS: Shit, still a four.

1278
01:27:02,442 --> 01:27:06,254
LAURA: No, you rerolled, yeah.

1279
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:10,505
MATT: Red one would add to it. If you wanted to
use a red one to add to it, you can.

1280
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:11,978
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not?

1281
01:27:11,978 --> 01:27:13,568
MATT: All right. So add a d6 to that one.

1282
01:27:13,568 --> 01:27:18,982
TRAVIS: Fucking dick-licking piece of-- five.

1283
01:27:18,982 --> 01:27:21,015
MATT: Five. Do you want to use another chip to add
more to it?

1284
01:27:21,015 --> 01:27:22,533
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not?

1285
01:27:22,533 --> 01:27:26,395
MATT: On the important rolls.

1286
01:27:26,395 --> 01:27:30,504
TRAVIS: What is the deal? There's no--

1287
01:27:30,504 --> 01:27:31,966
MATT: So, total of six?

1288
01:27:31,966 --> 01:27:35,679
TRAVIS: Yes! I have giblets. This is terrible!

1289
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:45,097
MATT: A respectable five minutes pass before he
makes his way outside of the room, nice and sweaty.

1290
01:27:45,097 --> 01:27:48,731
TRAVIS: With my sleeves rolled up.

1291
01:27:48,731 --> 01:27:56,943
MATT: You come down immediately to see what
appears to be a stand-off, rifle drawn, right at

1292
01:27:56,943 --> 01:28:00,432
the Reverend, as you begin to reach towards her
gun on the side--

1293
01:28:00,432 --> 01:28:04,417
LIAM: Okay, I know I'm in front of her. Where's
Stinky?

1294
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:06,101
MATT: He's up the stairway.

1295
01:28:06,101 --> 01:28:07,308
LIAM: He who? She?

1296
01:28:07,308 --> 01:28:12,232
MATT: She's maybe four or five feet from you.

1297
01:28:12,232 --> 01:28:17,609
LIAM: Do I need to touch the gun to-- oh, okay.
Then I can't do that at all. She's five feet

1298
01:28:17,609 --> 01:28:18,919
behind me.

1299
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:22,790
LAURA: Also, I'd probably murder you for trying to
touch my weapon.

1300
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:30,774
TRAVIS: She was very forthcoming. Gave me quite a
bit of difficulty at first, but-- oh, what happened here?

1301
01:28:30,774 --> 01:28:35,607
LIAM: I'm backing up, I'm backing up. Relax,
relax. Hand behind me.

1302
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:36,869
LAURA: Put your hands down.

1303
01:28:36,869 --> 01:28:39,831
LIAM: I brush my fingers across her gun and cast
Smite.

1304
01:28:39,831 --> 01:28:43,432
MATT: Okay, against her gun? Spend two points.

1305
01:28:43,432 --> 01:28:45,882
LAURA: Would I have noticed that he brushed his
hand?

1306
01:28:45,882 --> 01:28:47,419
MATT: Make a notice check.

1307
01:28:47,419 --> 01:28:49,060
LIAM: It's called the dick graze.

1308
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,748
LAURA: I don't got a dick.

1309
01:28:50,748 --> 01:28:56,875
LIAM: What do I roll for this? Spirit, right?
Faith.

1310
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:58,885
MARISHA: Just the tip.

1311
01:28:58,885 --> 01:29:00,864
LIAM: God damn it.

1312
01:29:00,864 --> 01:29:10,060
LAURA: I got a four. Well, I've only got one blue
chip, and the other one's a reroll, so I can't get

1313
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:11,640
any better.

1314
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,159
LIAM: Total of nine.

1315
01:29:13,159 --> 01:29:21,685
MATT: All right. So that's with the raise, so you
go ahead, and there's a dull glow at the side of

1316
01:29:21,685 --> 01:29:27,895
her holster as you manage to enchant her weapon
with Smite.

1317
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:29,456
LAURA: What's that mean?

1318
01:29:29,456 --> 01:29:37,052
MATT: You don't know. You do manage to glance to
the side and notice that he brushed his fingers

1319
01:29:37,052 --> 01:29:41,686
past, and there's a slight glow off of your
holster. "Two!"

1320
01:29:41,686 --> 01:29:49,684
MARISHA: Dan. Pull that trigger and it will be the
last trigger you pull. So says the dark entity

1321
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,856
behind your shoulder.

1322
01:29:51,856 --> 01:29:53,597
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1323
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:58,185
TRAVIS: Which way is Dan facing in relation to
me?

1324
01:29:58,185 --> 01:30:02,643
MATT: You're looking down the stairs. You see
Dan's-- they're both at the side, looking at each

1325
01:30:02,643 --> 01:30:04,467
other from your perspective, down below.

1326
01:30:04,467 --> 01:30:09,472
MARISHA: I'm going to use a black chip just to see
if I can do better. Six again. Six.

1327
01:30:09,472 --> 01:30:11,314
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

1328
01:30:11,314 --> 01:30:16,344
MATT: All right! I'll pick it up later.

1329
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:21,360
(clang)

1330
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,229
MATT: Thank you. Oh, it sounds good when you do
that.

1331
01:30:23,271 --> 01:30:25,425
LIAM: You don't want to shoot an unarmed man, do
you, Dan?

1332
01:30:25,425 --> 01:30:34,614
MATT: So he's still-- glances over his shoulder.
Doesn't see anything. You do hear a door slam in

1333
01:30:34,614 --> 01:30:43,417
the distance, and a voice comes blaring out. "Who
the fuck is causing problems in my saloon?"

1334
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:44,755
LAURA: Al?

1335
01:30:44,755 --> 01:30:53,234
MATT: "And who the fuck is calling my name?" At
this point, Dan puts his gun down. "Sir, I didn't

1336
01:30:53,234 --> 01:30:58,550
"mean nothing by it, had these folks come in--" He's
like, "I will gut you like a god damn fish, Dan."

1337
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:07,857
MARISHA: Sudi starts crying. No-- no English.

1338
01:31:07,857 --> 01:31:11,001
MATT: "What do you want, or get the fuck out of my
place!"

1339
01:31:11,001 --> 01:31:17,250
LAURA: We're here to help. Me and these weirdos
that surround me are here to look for the people

1340
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:19,760
that have been killing your men.

1341
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,388
LIAM: You smell like cow plops.

1342
01:31:21,388 --> 01:31:25,230
TRAVIS: Mr. Schwerengen, Sydney Hopkins
Trivelpiece. We're on a mission to find--

1343
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:30,426
MATT: "The more you talk, the less I want to talk
to any of you. You. Looking to see if you can help

1344
01:31:30,426 --> 01:31:31,764
"my men who got killed, right?"

1345
01:31:31,764 --> 01:31:33,642
LAURA: That's right.

1346
01:31:33,642 --> 01:31:37,049
MATT: "Get on up to my office." He turns around
and goes back inside. Storms back out again and

1347
01:31:37,049 --> 01:31:41,111
goes like, "And Dan? You tell me next time we have
guests looking for me. Do not point a gun at

1348
01:31:41,111 --> 01:31:48,653
"them." Glances over at you and goes, "I don't
trust her. Go ahead and go that way. The rest of

1349
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:49,893
"them, let them up."

1350
01:31:49,893 --> 01:31:51,962
TRAVIS: Stinky Jules, be quick about it.

1351
01:31:51,962 --> 01:31:53,454
LAURA: Be quick about what?

1352
01:31:53,454 --> 01:31:54,943
TRAVIS: Your meeting.

1353
01:31:54,943 --> 01:31:57,034
LAURA: Why?

1354
01:31:57,034 --> 01:32:03,030
TRAVIS: No reason. The gentleman in the lobby
seems very aggressive.

1355
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:04,552
LAURA: Sure.

1356
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:08,343
LIAM: What just happened? Al invited the three of
us?

1357
01:32:08,343 --> 01:32:12,123
MATT: Three of you guys up, and was like, "You can
stay."

1358
01:32:12,123 --> 01:32:18,770
MARISHA: (groans) I go over and I start talking to
the whores, seeing if they want their fortunes told.

1359
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:23,150
MATT: All right. The three of you guys make your
way up to the office.

1360
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:25,019
LIAM: (Sudis voice) You're going to fuck a guy...

1361
01:32:25,019 --> 01:32:28,056
MARISHA: I see many STDs in your future.

1362
01:32:28,056 --> 01:32:35,654
MATT: Desk is up there, there's papers strewn
across, there's a balcony with a door half-open,

1363
01:32:35,654 --> 01:32:41,482
and you see a partially dressed woman currently
leaving out of the far bedroom, rushes past you

1364
01:32:41,482 --> 01:32:45,621
guys. You enter the room. "Would you mind closing
the door behind you?"

1365
01:32:45,621 --> 01:32:47,523
LAURA: Close the door, Rev.

1366
01:32:47,523 --> 01:32:48,927
LIAM: (creaking sound)

1367
01:32:48,927 --> 01:32:54,713
MATT: "All right. So. To who the fuck do I owe
this pleasure?"

1368
01:32:54,713 --> 01:33:01,573
LAURA: Well, I'm Stinky Jules. Nice to make your
acquaintance.

1369
01:33:01,573 --> 01:33:05,071
TRAVIS: I would ask if I may speak.

1370
01:33:05,071 --> 01:33:08,923
MATT: "Oh, be my guest."

1371
01:33:08,923 --> 01:33:15,514
TRAVIS: Oh. Lovely. Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece, at
your service, from the great country of England,

1372
01:33:15,514 --> 01:33:20,603
here to chronicle the glory and power of the Wild
West. You, sir, your name has quite the renown--

1373
01:33:20,603 --> 01:33:25,085
MATT: "Whereabouts in England? I actually had some
time there myself."

1374
01:33:25,085 --> 01:33:37,030
TRAVIS: Yes, well, point of fact, I am from
Tawnyland, and by route of Shepardshire. But I

1375
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:42,726
took a barge and landed in the beautiful state of
Mississippi.

1376
01:33:42,726 --> 01:33:44,738
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1377
01:33:44,738 --> 01:33:47,943
LIAM: Is he faking it?

1378
01:33:47,943 --> 01:33:51,369
LAURA: Is he faking what?

1379
01:33:51,369 --> 01:33:53,457
LIAM: Do you think he's from New Jersey?

1380
01:33:53,457 --> 01:34:00,151
TRAVIS: Six. Ten.

1381
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:06,956
MATT: "All right, calm down, calm down. Usually
folks aren't so eager around this place. Jittery.

1382
01:34:06,956 --> 01:34:16,380
"All right, so. You say you're here to help with my
men. All right." (sighs) And he walks out, looks

1383
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:23,687
over the balcony for a second. "Fucking cocksucker cleaned
out the tables with a grin. You seen this asshole

1384
01:34:23,687 --> 01:34:26,658
"walking in town, taking all the money?"

1385
01:34:26,658 --> 01:34:32,757
LAURA: Oh. Yes, we did. Well, I tried to punch
him. I almost punched him. But we did in fact see

1386
01:34:32,757 --> 01:34:34,510
him cheating at poker earlier today.

1387
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:37,038
MATT: "Next time he crosses your path, go ahead
and punch him for me, if you don't mind."

1388
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:39,105
LAURA: I will certainly try to do that again,
sir.

1389
01:34:39,105 --> 01:34:40,411
TRAVIS: That's Simon he's speaking of.

1390
01:34:40,411 --> 01:34:42,079
LAURA: Simon.

1391
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:48,550
MATT: "Is that his name? Simon. Good to know.
Certainly hope he took Cy for all he's worth, too.

1392
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:56,014
"There goes a joyride for the trees alone. You see
him again, deck him. There's some cash in it for you."

1393
01:34:56,014 --> 01:34:57,746
TRAVIS: Understood.

1394
01:34:57,746 --> 01:35:02,048
LAURA: What's wrong with you?

1395
01:35:02,048 --> 01:35:04,876
TRAVIS: The hand is hurting quite a bit.

1396
01:35:04,876 --> 01:35:20,744
MATT: So. He says, "All right, so I've heard some
terrible fucking news. A new interest is coming to

1397
01:35:20,744 --> 01:35:29,024
"town soon. George Hurst. The same rich fucking
loadrunner's Hurst. Hurst, Hagen, Tevvyson,

1398
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:33,293
"cocksucker's company. Last thing we need in this
place is another fucking company man without an

1399
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:34,824
"appreciation for allies."

1400
01:35:34,824 --> 01:35:39,346
LAURA: Yeah. I don't have any idea what he just
said.

1401
01:35:39,346 --> 01:35:47,028
MATT: "I'll tell you what. You want work? Pay you
$400 to split, and a free run of the ladies for

1402
01:35:47,028 --> 01:35:53,206
"the night, if you bring me anything linking Hurst
to these rumors of silver going belly-up in this town."

1403
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:59,374
LAURA: What the fuck does this have to do with
that damn creature killing people? I'm confused.

1404
01:35:59,374 --> 01:36:04,848
TRAVIS: Yes, I do believe it was two of your men
that were torn asunder by this horrible creature.

1405
01:36:04,848 --> 01:36:07,859
LAURA: Do you think it was Hurst that killed
them?

1406
01:36:07,859 --> 01:36:13,025
MATT: "Very possible. You find that out, you come
back with some information about that. Or, if it's

1407
01:36:13,025 --> 01:36:17,178
"this fucking bear they keep saying it is, bring
back the bear's hide. $200 to you to spread as you

1408
01:36:17,178 --> 01:36:20,269
"like for the hide of whatever fucking creature
killed my boys."

1409
01:36:20,269 --> 01:36:24,918
TRAVIS: So $400 for the silver and $200 for the
beast.

1410
01:36:24,918 --> 01:36:28,394
MATT: "It's hard to find dependable men these
days, and some heroics in town can only bring

1411
01:36:28,394 --> 01:36:31,873
"spirits up. Higher spirits make for higher-paying
customers."

1412
01:36:31,873 --> 01:36:35,553
TRAVIS: Yes, yes.

1413
01:36:35,553 --> 01:36:42,718
LAURA: Sure. Where would we start to look for any
of the shit you just talked about?

1414
01:36:42,718 --> 01:36:46,990
MATT: "If I knew, I'd go looking for it
my-fucking-self! What am I paying you for?"

1415
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:53,608
TRAVIS: Mr. Schwerengen, I am quite familiar with
Cy's establishment.

1416
01:36:53,608 --> 01:36:55,327
MATT: "Shut the fuck up, please."

1417
01:36:55,327 --> 01:36:57,259
TRAVIS: I was just saying, I have information.

1418
01:36:57,259 --> 01:36:58,610
LAURA: He has information.

1419
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:01,515
MATT: "Spill it."

1420
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:06,705
TRAVIS: I was just saying, I could lead these
intrepid band of investigators over to Cy's place and--

1421
01:37:06,705 --> 01:37:10,435
LAURA: Cy? Simon?

1422
01:37:10,435 --> 01:37:13,113
TRAVIS: Yes, Cy. He runs the-- what is the name of
the saloon--

1423
01:37:13,113 --> 01:37:14,915
MATT: "The Bella Union."

1424
01:37:14,915 --> 01:37:20,554
TRAVIS: The Bella Union. Oh, wait, that's where we
had our...

1425
01:37:20,554 --> 01:37:26,656
MATT: "So. Want some cash? Find out who the fuck
killed my men. See if Hurst is behind any of this."

1426
01:37:26,656 --> 01:37:29,264
LAURA: All right. We will do that.

1427
01:37:29,264 --> 01:37:33,014
MATT: "Now, get out. Your choice: stairs or the
balcony."

1428
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:34,347
TRAVIS: Stairs.

1429
01:37:34,347 --> 01:37:39,671
MATT: "Good. Wise choice." Slams the door behind
you guys.

1430
01:37:39,671 --> 01:37:41,743
LAURA: Kind of wanted to go out the balcony.

1431
01:37:41,743 --> 01:37:46,599
MATT: You, in the meantime, there is a woman who
has come up to you and said, "Actually, I've always

1432
01:37:46,599 --> 01:37:48,789
"wanted my fortune told, if you don't mind."

1433
01:37:48,789 --> 01:37:51,227
MARISHA: Absolutely, darling. What's your name?

1434
01:37:51,227 --> 01:37:52,504
MATT: "Lisa."

1435
01:37:52,504 --> 01:37:58,725
MARISHA: So what does Lisa look like? Can I do a
notice check on Lisa?

1436
01:37:58,725 --> 01:38:09,190
MATT: Yeah. The voice in your head, once again,
Liam, goes, "Come. Take one. Any of them. It'll

1437
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:11,911
"right your connection with your lord."

1438
01:38:11,911 --> 01:38:20,149
MARISHA: Seven. Lisa, Lisa, come here, darling,
Lisa. Let me get a good look at you.

1439
01:38:20,149 --> 01:38:28,038
MATT: She's young, she hasn't been in this
business long. You can see a bit of fear and worry

1440
01:38:28,038 --> 01:38:29,706
in the back of her eyes.

1441
01:38:29,706 --> 01:38:34,103
MARISHA: Looks like someone hurt you in your past.
Da?

1442
01:38:34,103 --> 01:38:36,783
MATT: "Get hurt a lot in this line of work."

1443
01:38:36,783 --> 01:38:41,443
MARISHA: So are you running or are you chasing
pain, Lisa?

1444
01:38:41,443 --> 01:38:45,335
MATT: "What do you mean?"

1445
01:38:45,335 --> 01:38:48,581
MARISHA: Be careful.

1446
01:38:48,581 --> 01:38:53,146
MATT: "Careful of what?"

1447
01:38:53,146 --> 01:39:01,767
MARISHA: This work you do could very easily
consume you. But it hasn't yet.

1448
01:39:01,767 --> 01:39:07,490
MATT: As you can say that, you can see one of the
whores nearby trips and knocks her down onto the

1449
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:09,600
table, knocking out her front teeth.

1450
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,465
MARISHA: Wait, the woman I was just talking to?

1451
01:39:13,465 --> 01:39:20,868
MATT: Yeah. (muffled screams) And just begins running
off. The other women take her in and then start

1452
01:39:20,868 --> 01:39:22,613
picking up her teeth on the table.

1453
01:39:22,613 --> 01:39:23,720
TRAVIS: What did you do to her?

1454
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,840
MATT: "You get out of this place, you fortune
teller. You get out of this place."

1455
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,646
MARISHA: I did not see that coming.

1456
01:39:28,646 --> 01:39:36,424
MATT: You hear (gun cocks) and Dan has his rifle
up at the back and is like, "I told you to keep out."

1457
01:39:36,424 --> 01:39:39,743
LIAM: I swoop and I hook her on the arm and I just
guide her out the door.

1458
01:39:39,743 --> 01:39:41,221
MATT: All right.

1459
01:39:41,221 --> 01:39:46,377
MARISHA: Don't worry, we'll meet again, Dan. As
well as the demon on your shoulder. Bye, demon!

1460
01:39:46,377 --> 01:39:48,315
Bye-bye! (blows kisses)

1461
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,513
MATT: He looks over his shoulder again, kind of
nervously.

1462
01:39:50,513 --> 01:39:53,498
LIAM: Strong stuff you serve. Strong stuff. Come
on, out the door you go.

1463
01:39:53,498 --> 01:39:57,071
MARISHA: I made like five gold doing that.

1464
01:39:57,071 --> 01:40:05,842
TRAVIS: I'll be with you shortly. Mr. Doherty? If
I may. The whore that I was able to interview

1465
01:40:05,842 --> 01:40:07,704
upstairs. What was her name?

1466
01:40:07,704 --> 01:40:10,643
MATT: "Which one was it?"

1467
01:40:10,643 --> 01:40:13,999
TRAVIS: The red-haired one. Lovely blue eyes.

1468
01:40:13,999 --> 01:40:15,577
MATT: "Virginia."

1469
01:40:15,577 --> 01:40:21,556
TRAVIS: Virginia, yes. Would you do me a favor and
follow up with her in a bit. I did do quite a

1470
01:40:21,556 --> 01:40:25,235
number on her. I just want to make sure that she's
all right.

1471
01:40:25,235 --> 01:40:27,490
MATT: "I'm sure she is."

1472
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:34,190
TRAVIS: I was quite proud of myself. Anyway. Oh,
Stinky Jules! Unfortunately, Sue knocked all the

1473
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:39,955
teeth out of the woman she was trying to tell the
fortune for. Dan, here, was about to put a hole in

1474
01:40:39,955 --> 01:40:41,542
her head again, so we're going to--

1475
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:44,121
MARISHA: I did not touch that woman. I was simply
giving her fortune.

1476
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:46,124
LAURA: How'd she lose her teeth, then?

1477
01:40:46,124 --> 01:40:50,511
MARISHA: She just tripped. One of the other women
pulled her down and she tripped and fell. It had

1478
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:51,842
nothing to do with me.

1479
01:40:51,842 --> 01:40:55,706
LAURA: Can't blame her for that! I mean. Lots of
people are drinking in this bar. Accidents happen.

1480
01:40:55,706 --> 01:41:02,115
MARISHA: Not everything is necessarily a pull of
fate's strings, okay? It's sometimes shit just happens.

1481
01:41:02,115 --> 01:41:07,801
TRAVIS: Perhaps we should find our way to this
spot. Bartender, may I have some whisky? Could you

1482
01:41:07,801 --> 01:41:10,413
pour it on this hand? It's throbbing quite badly.

1483
01:41:10,413 --> 01:41:15,910
MATT: As you turn at this point, you see Dan still
has his gun up and says, "Go ahead and find whisky

1484
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:21,724
"elsewhere. You four are fucking not welcome right
now until you come back with what Al was asking about."

1485
01:41:21,724 --> 01:41:24,522
LIAM: Understood, Dan. Thank you for your
patience.

1486
01:41:24,522 --> 01:41:27,082
TRAVIS: Mr. Schwerengen has said--

1487
01:41:27,082 --> 01:41:28,329
MATT: "Out."

1488
01:41:28,329 --> 01:41:32,071
LAURA: Get the fuck out! Let's go.

1489
01:41:32,071 --> 01:41:33,873
MATT: You guys find your way outside of the Gem
Saloon.

1490
01:41:33,873 --> 01:41:37,166
LAURA: Why are you petting air?

1491
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:42,023
MARISHA: Just itch. Bit of itch.

1492
01:41:42,023 --> 01:41:46,721
LAURA: It's better if you're itching to actually
touch your body. I've found it has a better effect.

1493
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:58,131
MATT: The monkey in your ear whispers out. "Follow
the trail of gold and silver. This is where you

1494
01:41:58,131 --> 01:42:00,490
"must go." And curls back up into your hair.

1495
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:01,941
MARISHA: Ah, Manitou.

1496
01:42:01,941 --> 01:42:06,355
LIAM: Hockmanitou?

1497
01:42:06,355 --> 01:42:09,806
TRAVIS: It's her foreign tongue, I'm sure.

1498
01:42:09,806 --> 01:42:13,137
MARISHA: Just thinking out loud.

1499
01:42:13,137 --> 01:42:16,764
LIAM: I'm trying to figure it out. I heard you say
"Da." Are you Russian?

1500
01:42:16,764 --> 01:42:21,907
TRAVIS: Stinky Jules, could you pour some whisky
on my hand? I'm afraid it's infected. I'm feeling

1501
01:42:21,907 --> 01:42:26,025
a bit feverish. I feel-- oh, please, careful now.

1502
01:42:26,025 --> 01:42:27,880
LAURA: I poke at it.

1503
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:32,186
TRAVIS: (yelps) Oh, it's quite pus-ridden. It
feels wonderful.

1504
01:42:32,186 --> 01:42:37,045
LAURA: I push it out. Okay. Yeah, that looks
pretty.

1505
01:42:37,045 --> 01:42:40,393
TRAVIS: Quite. Careful. Thank you.

1506
01:42:40,393 --> 01:42:43,143
LAURA: Sure, take some whisky there.

1507
01:42:43,143 --> 01:42:44,632
TRAVIS: Yes, if you don't mind.

1508
01:42:44,632 --> 01:42:48,182
MATT: Pour some whisky over the hand. You feel
inspired. Travis, you get a red chip.

1509
01:42:48,182 --> 01:42:57,824
LIAM: I'm going to take-- Come here, Mr. English,
or wherever you're from.

1510
01:42:57,824 --> 01:42:59,311
TRAVIS: Mr. Trivelpiece.

1511
01:42:59,311 --> 01:43:03,710
LIAM: Right. Let's take ten minutes to take care
of this.

1512
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:05,345
TRAVIS: Oh, no, no, that's quite all right.

1513
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:06,513
LIAM: You want the pus?

1514
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:11,096
TRAVIS: I must learn to be as tough as the lands I
am interviewing.

1515
01:43:11,096 --> 01:43:13,954
MATT: Go ahead and make a guts check.

1516
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:18,362
TRAVIS: I don't know where that is.

1517
01:43:18,362 --> 01:43:22,623
LIAM: Where'd it go? I don't think you have it.

1518
01:43:22,623 --> 01:43:24,277
TRAVIS: Minus two for me, if I don't have it?

1519
01:43:24,277 --> 01:43:25,687
LAURA: Just a four minus two.

1520
01:43:25,687 --> 01:43:39,531
TRAVIS: I'm going to add a blue chip, because that
sucked so much. So five.

1521
01:43:39,531 --> 01:43:45,911
MATT: Five, okay. You, after saying that, shake it
off and look down. You can deal with this.

1522
01:43:45,911 --> 01:43:47,914
TRAVIS: Yes, it's quite all right.

1523
01:43:47,914 --> 01:43:51,017
MATT: No longer shaken by it, you feel like this
wound will subside in time.

1524
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:54,365
LIAM: I'm going to pull Stinky off into an alley
for a second. Stinky.

1525
01:43:54,365 --> 01:43:59,394
LAURA: You want some more of this action, Rev?

1526
01:43:59,394 --> 01:44:05,731
LIAM: You know, I'm not a Sunday school child. I'm
not a blushing flower. I understand how the world

1527
01:44:05,731 --> 01:44:14,436
works. I don't need the money. So you can have my
share. Helping this town is enough. But I do want

1528
01:44:14,436 --> 01:44:19,996
to understand-- I realize you have a higher
tolerance than I do. What happened last night?

1529
01:44:19,996 --> 01:44:30,465
LAURA: Oh, yeah, we had sex. Well, you had a lot
of sex with the Sue girl, a little bit of sex with

1530
01:44:30,465 --> 01:44:32,476
brains over there.

1531
01:44:32,476 --> 01:44:40,227
LIAM: Okay. That was very candid.

1532
01:44:40,227 --> 01:44:46,327
MATT: The voice in your ear creeps in and goes,
"It's all true."

1533
01:44:46,327 --> 01:44:49,910
LIAM: I know that's a fucking devil.

1534
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:53,053
TRAVIS: He shakes his head no.

1535
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:58,652
LAURA: Is that not all right with you, Rev?

1536
01:44:58,652 --> 01:45:01,710
LIAM: People find comfort where they can.

1537
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:10,027
LAURA: You were real, real, real into it, I just
want to let you know. You were having a lot of

1538
01:45:10,075 --> 01:45:15,632
fun. I even, at one point, asked if you wanted to
stop, because it seemed a little bit obscene even

1539
01:45:15,632 --> 01:45:18,637
to me, but you kept on go--

1540
01:45:18,637 --> 01:45:20,883
LIAM: Do you have any whisky?

1541
01:45:20,883 --> 01:45:22,970
LAURA: I do. Here, have some.

1542
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:24,348
LIAM: Can I have it?

1543
01:45:24,348 --> 01:45:30,214
MATT: At this point, the sun has begun to set, and
you hear in the distance what sounds like a gunshot.

1544
01:45:30,214 --> 01:45:33,269
LAURA: Did you really just drink my whisky?

1545
01:45:33,269 --> 01:45:34,364
LIAM: No.

1546
01:45:34,364 --> 01:45:35,621
LAURA: Yes, you did.

1547
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:36,837
TRAVIS: A gunshot?

1548
01:45:36,837 --> 01:45:39,621
MATT: A gunshot in the distance. A second
gunshot.

1549
01:45:39,621 --> 01:45:41,686
LAURA: Shit! I take off running.

1550
01:45:41,686 --> 01:45:42,833
MARISHA: Let's follow.

1551
01:45:42,833 --> 01:45:47,770
MATT: Okay. You guys go charging off now, on the
sound of this distant gunshot.

1552
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:49,110
MARISHA: I'm on my peg leg.

1553
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:50,350
TRAVIS: Come on, Trinket.

1554
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:51,362
LIAM: Ever consider marriage?

1555
01:45:51,362 --> 01:46:00,361
MATT: You make your way to the outskirts of the
town, where you see there's now people surrounding

1556
01:46:00,361 --> 01:46:08,020
what looks to be an individual who is torn open,
their stomach pulled out, but they're holding a

1557
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:11,349
gun, and they're on the ground, passing out at
this point.

1558
01:46:11,349 --> 01:46:15,634
LAURA: Oh, shit! I pull out my gun and look around
for whatever it was that was just attacking him.

1559
01:46:15,634 --> 01:46:17,658
TRAVIS: I run down to the poor individual.

1560
01:46:17,658 --> 01:46:19,001
MATT: Notice check.

1561
01:46:19,001 --> 01:46:28,736
LAURA: Notice, notice. Damn it. I'm going to--
wait. Damn it! All right, I'm going to spend a blue.

1562
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:33,571
LIAM: Hey, Marshal? You think I got two minutes
for the bathroom before the shit hits the fan, here?

1563
01:46:33,571 --> 01:46:35,201
MATT: Sure, go for it.

1564
01:46:35,201 --> 01:46:39,474
LAURA: It's because he just drank all that whisky.
Going straight through him.

1565
01:46:39,474 --> 01:46:44,193
LAURA: Can I-- I only got four.

1566
01:46:44,193 --> 01:46:49,480
MATT: You got a four? Looking around the darkness,
as the shadow's started to take the nearby forest,

1567
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:53,436
you see nothing before you. But you do see some of
the other folks in town who are starting to bring

1568
01:46:53,436 --> 01:46:59,249
out what looks like torchlight and starting to
make a little posse to go out and seek. You see

1569
01:46:59,249 --> 01:47:07,859
the well-dressed gentleman who wandered up
earlier, Simon. "What's going on? This is-- what?"

1570
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:09,924
MARISHA: Simon, was it?

1571
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:14,162
MATT: "Yes. Hello again."

1572
01:47:14,162 --> 01:47:18,098
MARISHA: What brings you out here? You came quite
fast.

1573
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:20,358
LAURA: Simon! I walk up and I punch him.

1574
01:47:20,358 --> 01:47:22,622
(laughter)

1575
01:47:22,622 --> 01:47:24,210
MATT: Go ahead and roll fighting.

1576
01:47:24,210 --> 01:47:26,113
MARISHA: Yes! Yes!

1577
01:47:26,113 --> 01:47:30,362
TRAVIS: And while they're with Simon, I would like
to be with the guy that's holding the gun and torn open.

1578
01:47:30,362 --> 01:47:32,128
MATT: Okay.

1579
01:47:32,128 --> 01:47:33,395
LAURA: I got a five.

1580
01:47:33,395 --> 01:47:41,234
MATT: You got a five? Okay, go ahead and just roll
a d4. Or what's your strength?

1581
01:47:41,234 --> 01:47:44,992
LAURA: Strength is-- oh, it's just four.

1582
01:47:44,992 --> 01:47:47,363
MATT: Yeah, so roll a d4, add one to it.

1583
01:47:47,363 --> 01:47:48,427
LAURA: Two.

1584
01:47:48,427 --> 01:47:53,634
MATT: All right, so you-- is that your fighting
roll?

1585
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:55,323
LAURA: Oh, I want to reroll.

1586
01:47:55,323 --> 01:47:58,148
MATT: Oh, go ahead and reroll. The fighting is a
d4?

1587
01:47:58,148 --> 01:47:59,977
LAURA: I fought him, I got--

1588
01:47:59,977 --> 01:48:02,410
MATT: No, you got the five, yes, so you're going
to reroll the--

1589
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:06,828
LAURA: The attack. Four! And add one to it, so
five.

1590
01:48:06,828 --> 01:48:11,882
MARISHA: Right before her fist meets his face, I
go, pain incoming.

1591
01:48:11,882 --> 01:48:19,989
MATT: And he goes, "What?" (impact) Her fist comes
out of the side of your visual perspective. His

1592
01:48:19,989 --> 01:48:23,069
hat gets flung off to the side. He hits the
ground.

1593
01:48:23,069 --> 01:48:24,977
MARISHA: See? I can predict future!

1594
01:48:24,977 --> 01:48:26,644
MATT: He's now missing a tooth.

1595
01:48:26,644 --> 01:48:33,660
LAURA: I pick up the tooth, and I put it in my
pocket. And I tell everybody, everybody saw that!

1596
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:36,479
If anybody asks, I did in fact punch that man.

1597
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:41,258
MATT: A man rushes out and picks him up and goes,
"Are you okay?" And helps Simon up off the ground.

1598
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:49,335
You see a man looking with a sad turtle-like
wrinkled face, a paisley-blue velvet outfit that's

1599
01:48:49,335 --> 01:48:58,344
worn, dirty, a hat much like yours, and he
stammers as he lifts him off the ground. "Why? Why

1600
01:48:58,344 --> 01:49:04,242
"have you taken this moment to feel it important to
impart onto my gentle cousin your fist?"

1601
01:49:04,242 --> 01:49:09,428
LAURA: Oh, because I was asked to by Mr.
Salinger.

1602
01:49:09,428 --> 01:49:11,650
MARISHA: Schwerenger.

1603
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:13,028
LAURA: Schewerenger.

1604
01:49:13,158 --> 01:49:14,173
MARISHA: There we go.

1605
01:49:14,173 --> 01:49:19,808
MATT: "Al? Al told you to? Did you piss off Al?
That's dangerous."

1606
01:49:19,808 --> 01:49:22,912
MARISHA: What they call you, cousin? Or is your
name Cousin?

1607
01:49:22,912 --> 01:49:33,430
MATT: "He is my cousin. I'm E.B. Farnum, the mayor
of this fair town, and I am also the owner of the

1608
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:41,978
"Grand Central Hotel, if you ever want to come stay
with us. You're more than welcome. Is she welcome?

1609
01:49:41,978 --> 01:49:49,639
"She just punched you." And Simon's still coming to
his senses and goes, "I-- Why?!"

1610
01:49:49,639 --> 01:49:55,133
LAURA: I just walk away from him and start asking
people if anybody saw who attacked that other feller.

1611
01:49:55,165 --> 01:50:00,767
MATT: Okay. Folks are confused at this point, and
they're pulling out their torches and their guns.

1612
01:50:00,767 --> 01:50:04,974
The guy on the ground, by the way, as you're
searching him, has--

1613
01:50:04,974 --> 01:50:06,241
TRAVIS: Is he alive?

1614
01:50:06,241 --> 01:50:08,444
MATT: He is expiring rapidly.

1615
01:50:08,444 --> 01:50:10,162
TRAVIS: Is he? I bend down and say--

1616
01:50:10,162 --> 01:50:12,772
LIAM: Who is he? What's going on?

1617
01:50:12,772 --> 01:50:14,637
MARISHA: We've got a guy in the street.

1618
01:50:14,637 --> 01:50:23,031
MATT: "It was teeth and fur." And he passes out.

1619
01:50:23,031 --> 01:50:25,632
LIAM: I'm walking out to him and laying on hands.

1620
01:50:25,632 --> 01:50:29,233
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a faith check.
Two more points.

1621
01:50:29,233 --> 01:50:31,639
LIAM: I know. Okay.

1622
01:50:31,639 --> 01:50:33,706
MARISHA: Did you recover any?

1623
01:50:33,706 --> 01:50:35,202
LIAM: I don't know.

1624
01:50:35,202 --> 01:50:36,971
MARISHA: He recovers every few hours, right?

1625
01:50:36,971 --> 01:50:38,158
MATT: One.

1626
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:42,391
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to use-- the reroll is the
blue?

1627
01:50:42,391 --> 01:50:44,190
LAURA: No, the black is the reroll.

1628
01:50:44,190 --> 01:50:47,531
MATT: Other ones add d6s. Thank you.

1629
01:50:47,531 --> 01:50:50,240
LIAM: 12.

1630
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,903
MARISHA: Ooh!

1631
01:50:51,903 --> 01:50:54,269
LIAM: Put those innards back in, son.

1632
01:50:54,269 --> 01:51:00,809
MATT: As you reach down, your hand touches him. In
the darkness of the newly formed dusk, you see

1633
01:51:00,809 --> 01:51:08,588
warmth begin to emerge from your medic's hands,
and all the intestines slowly pull back into the

1634
01:51:08,588 --> 01:51:13,580
body, the wound closing, leaving the shorn shirt
of the individual. He comes to consciousness with

1635
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:15,312
a deep breath.

1636
01:51:15,312 --> 01:51:16,976
LAURA: That's just fucking crazy.

1637
01:51:16,976 --> 01:51:18,020
LIAM: You're okay.

1638
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:23,119
MATT: You can see E.B. Farnum's like, "What is
going on? Everything's turned upside-down. I don't

1639
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:24,526
"know what's happening."

1640
01:51:24,526 --> 01:51:28,375
TRAVIS: Reverend, perhaps you could speak some
calming words to Mr. Farnum.

1641
01:51:28,375 --> 01:51:30,202
MATT: Simon turns to him and they whisper to each
other.

1642
01:51:30,202 --> 01:51:35,073
MARISHA: I'm still standing next to Simon. Do I
hear what he says?

1643
01:51:35,073 --> 01:51:37,814
MATT: Make a notice check.

1644
01:51:37,814 --> 01:51:47,894
MARISHA: Ugh, I'm going to spend a reroll. Not
much better. Three!

1645
01:51:47,894 --> 01:52:00,369
MATT: Give this to Laura, please. Three? No, you
don't hear anything. You hear some whispering, and

1646
01:52:00,369 --> 01:52:06,359
you notice that Simon nods and looks about
shiftily and darts off into the town as E.B. takes his

1647
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:09,660
place with a big smile.

1648
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:14,117
MARISHA: Can I follow Simon? Stealthily, like
blend in with the crowd behind him?

1649
01:52:14,117 --> 01:52:15,814
MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check.

1650
01:52:15,814 --> 01:52:22,287
MARISHA: I'm not trained in this. Ooh, I rolled a
three, though, which is pretty good. Minus two. So one.

1651
01:52:22,287 --> 01:52:28,305
MATT: As you turn around, E.B. goes, "Ma'am, I'm
sorry to bother you. A lot of things have been

1652
01:52:28,305 --> 01:52:30,044
"happening in this town as of late--"

1653
01:52:30,044 --> 01:52:31,862
MARISHA: Your palms are very sweaty. Don't touch
again.

1654
01:52:31,862 --> 01:52:33,673
MATT: "Sorry, it's a thing."

1655
01:52:33,673 --> 01:52:36,476
MARISHA: You seem nervous. Why nervous?

1656
01:52:36,476 --> 01:52:39,473
MATT: "I always seem nervous, but as the mayor of
this town, I feel--"

1657
01:52:39,473 --> 01:52:42,018
MARISHA: Mayor? Who made you mayor?

1658
01:52:42,018 --> 01:52:52,351
MATT: "I did. And Mr. Schwerengen. I don't have to
talk to you! Look, miss. There has been a terrible

1659
01:52:52,351 --> 01:52:58,368
"incursion of an evil sort, a blight on our fair
city, and I think it's important that we as a

1660
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:01,955
"people figure out who is responsible."

1661
01:53:01,955 --> 01:53:04,725
LAURA: I agree with that statement.

1662
01:53:04,725 --> 01:53:10,793
MARISHA: I know, E.B., I know. And I reach out and
I touch his face.

1663
01:53:10,793 --> 01:53:16,483
MATT: Smacks it away. "Unhand me, gypsy foul
demon-woman!"

1664
01:53:16,483 --> 01:53:21,053
TRAVIS: You know, the Reverend is quite good at
calming the nerves. He has quite the touch.

1665
01:53:21,053 --> 01:53:32,143
MATT: At this point, the man who he's healed
stands up. Black chip for Laura. And goes, "I

1666
01:53:32,143 --> 01:53:41,810
"don't know what to say." You see now, he's an
older gentleman with a big, thick beard and a

1667
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:50,887
bowler hat and he's shorter, stockier. "You saved
my life, and I appreciate that."

1668
01:53:50,887 --> 01:53:55,219
LIAM: All I ask is that you use your time more
kindly and more wisely.

1669
01:53:55,219 --> 01:53:58,761
LAURA: And tell us who it was that attacked you.

1670
01:53:58,761 --> 01:54:07,778
MATT: "Name's Charlie. Charlie Arthur. I was out
taking a walk in my thinking hour, when I noticed

1671
01:54:07,778 --> 01:54:14,901
"something moving on the outskirts of town. I went
to check it out, like one is wont to do in my

1672
01:54:14,901 --> 01:54:25,260
"place here in town. Something with a lot of fur
and teeth came at me from that way." And he points

1673
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:30,143
out towards the north end of town that leads out
towards the various mining claims.

1674
01:54:30,143 --> 01:54:32,505
LIAM: How big a creature are we talking about,
Charlie?

1675
01:54:32,505 --> 01:54:40,032
MATT: "About the size of a bear, best I could
tell. But not bear-like. It was more savage, like

1676
01:54:40,032 --> 01:54:48,435
"a dog. But this dog was on its hind legs, it
looked like. Then it wasn't, then it ran like a

1677
01:54:48,435 --> 01:54:54,708
"bear. I don't know. I got two shots off, didn't
seem to stop it, then it tore out the side of my

1678
01:54:54,708 --> 01:54:56,368
"stomach and left me for dead."

1679
01:54:56,368 --> 01:54:58,169
LAURA: But you're not dead!

1680
01:54:58,169 --> 01:55:03,613
TRAVIS: Your wounds seem to have healed
miraculously.

1681
01:55:03,613 --> 01:55:06,709
MATT: "Excuse me while I go get a very firm
drink."

1682
01:55:06,709 --> 01:55:08,657
TRAVIS: Perhaps I can walk you there.

1683
01:55:08,657 --> 01:55:16,075
MATT: "You keep strange company, and while I
appreciate what you've done, that weird shit--

1684
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:18,289
"I've had enough of it for the day."

1685
01:55:18,289 --> 01:55:25,509
LAURA: We should go check out that
bear-walking-dog-bear beastly sort of creature and

1686
01:55:25,509 --> 01:55:26,737
kill it.

1687
01:55:26,737 --> 01:55:30,781
MATT: You can see E.B. is still looking over your
shoulder as you're talking with him, and he's

1688
01:55:30,781 --> 01:55:38,489
pushed you away. "I'm sorry. I think it is time
that I returned about my business and left you,

1689
01:55:38,489 --> 01:55:43,652
"woman of the arcane dark arts, out of my sight.
Good day."

1690
01:55:43,652 --> 01:55:47,992
MARISHA: Oh, don't worry, E.B., I don't have to be
in your sights.

1691
01:55:47,992 --> 01:55:53,704
LAURA: Again, aim for the actual part that itches.
It helps, I swear.

1692
01:55:53,704 --> 01:56:00,283
LIAM: Charlie. It's a gift from above. Don't waste
it.

1693
01:56:00,283 --> 01:56:10,012
MATT: "Oh. Ugh." And he seems like he's super
confused and torn by the whole thing that's

1694
01:56:10,012 --> 01:56:13,200
happened. He just walks into town. Some of the
people are out now, forming parties who go out

1695
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,608
into the middle of the forest.

1696
01:56:14,608 --> 01:56:17,735
TRAVIS: I'll be with you in one moment. I chase
after Charlie and I put my hand on his shoulder

1697
01:56:17,735 --> 01:56:22,700
and I say, dear sir, might I get a quote for my
book? Or rather, may I give you one?

1698
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:26,308
MATT: "I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking
about."

1699
01:56:26,308 --> 01:56:29,618
TRAVIS: (deep voice) "Well, some people don't get
to escape death." And I take my bowie knife out of

1700
01:56:29,618 --> 01:56:32,666
my sleeve and I stab him in the heart and turn the
wound so it opens.

1701
01:56:32,666 --> 01:56:35,860
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a fighting check.

1702
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:43,837
LIAM: He's a faker, yeah. Big surprise.

1703
01:56:43,837 --> 01:56:57,551
TRAVIS: I'm going to reroll the strength check.
That's an eight. That's a six. That's a 14.

1704
01:56:57,551 --> 01:57:02,288
MATT: With two raises, or raising the attack. So
go ahead and roll damage, plus an additional d6.

1705
01:57:02,288 --> 01:57:03,684
TRAVIS: How do I roll damage?

1706
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:05,226
MATT: It's under your bowie knife.

1707
01:57:05,226 --> 01:57:12,524
LIAM: Oh man, Jesus is displeased with you. I just
fucking healed that guy.

1708
01:57:12,524 --> 01:57:21,900
MARISHA: I told you, you are only prolonging the
inevitable. By 30 seconds, yeah. Sometimes people

1709
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,374
are just meant to die.

1710
01:57:23,374 --> 01:57:25,068
LIAM: Hey, man, Liam's agnostic. I get you.

1711
01:57:25,068 --> 01:57:27,936
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry, this guy.

1712
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:29,367
MATT: Yeah, so roll that twice.

1713
01:57:29,367 --> 01:57:31,432
TRAVIS: Five.

1714
01:57:31,432 --> 01:57:34,156
MATT: Plus two, so seven. Plus your d6.

1715
01:57:34,156 --> 01:57:36,359
TRAVIS: Ten.

1716
01:57:36,359 --> 01:57:42,073
LAURA: Seven plus four is 11.

1717
01:57:42,073 --> 01:57:43,407
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry, 11.

1718
01:57:43,407 --> 01:57:50,026
MATT: Do you want to use a red chip to add another
d6 to that? Just 'cause why not? Add another d6.

1719
01:57:50,026 --> 01:57:54,301
TRAVIS: Three. 14.

1720
01:57:54,301 --> 01:57:56,221
LIAM: Does he explode into a mist of blood?

1721
01:57:56,221 --> 01:58:04,286
MATT: No. As you walk away, arm over him, do you
keep walking with him? He goes limp in your grasp.

1722
01:58:04,286 --> 01:58:10,615
TRAVIS: Oh, no, no, someone come quickly! It seems
his wounds have been extremely grievous! Oh,

1723
01:58:10,615 --> 01:58:13,122
please, somebody help Charlie!

1724
01:58:13,122 --> 01:58:17,749
MATT: You guys now see as Charlie has collapsed to
the ground, now, just a gout of blood out of his

1725
01:58:17,749 --> 01:58:19,907
chest where the previous scar wounding was.

1726
01:58:19,907 --> 01:58:23,144
TRAVIS: Oh, my dear, oh, I wasn't quite ready for
this.

1727
01:58:23,144 --> 01:58:25,576
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on Sydney?

1728
01:58:25,576 --> 01:58:27,711
MATT: No insight.

1729
01:58:27,711 --> 01:58:33,017
TRAVIS: Please, I'm afraid his blood will get in
the bear wound.

1730
01:58:33,017 --> 01:58:38,037
LAURA: All right, let me check it out. Maybe we
should pour some more whisky on that. Just push on

1731
01:58:38,037 --> 01:58:39,220
the wound.

1732
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:43,826
TRAVIS: Don't fucking touch-- yes, yes. The whisky
alone would be great.

1733
01:58:43,826 --> 01:58:45,244
MARISHA: Nine.

1734
01:58:45,244 --> 01:58:51,024
MATT: If I could have you go ahead and make a
persuasion check.

1735
01:58:51,071 --> 01:58:52,399
TRAVIS: Okay.

1736
01:58:52,399 --> 01:59:00,161
LIAM: While he's doing that, question: he dropped
his accent for a second 20 minutes ago. But I

1737
01:59:00,161 --> 01:59:02,767
don't catch that if the dice don't catch it,
right?

1738
01:59:02,767 --> 01:59:04,007
MATT: Correct.

1739
01:59:04,007 --> 01:59:08,207
TRAVIS: I'm going to reroll that. Yes! So that's a
seven.

1740
01:59:08,207 --> 01:59:11,125
MATT: Seven? You going to add anything else to
that, or no?

1741
01:59:11,125 --> 01:59:24,088
TRAVIS: I'm going to add a d6. That is nine. Oh
wait, no, seven plus three is ten.

1742
01:59:24,088 --> 01:59:30,292
MATT: Ten? He looks earnest. It looks like somehow
the wound has reopened and Syndey is genuinely

1743
01:59:30,292 --> 01:59:32,495
fearful of what has just happened.

1744
01:59:32,495 --> 01:59:33,744
TRAVIS: I'm really not quite prepared.

1745
01:59:33,744 --> 01:59:35,128
MARISHA: I told you he was meant to die.

1746
01:59:35,128 --> 01:59:37,486
LIAM: Can't trust the English, if we've learned
anything.

1747
01:59:37,486 --> 01:59:42,517
TRAVIS: I was only trying to escort him back. Oh,
well. I suppose--

1748
01:59:42,517 --> 01:59:49,391
LAURA: Well, shit. We should get that doc out here
and take care of them wounds again. In the

1749
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:52,774
meantime, maybe we should all go find that bear.

1750
01:59:52,774 --> 01:59:58,145
MARISHA: We need to start at some of the mining
locations. Some of the gold and silver veins.

1751
01:59:58,145 --> 02:00:00,552
TRAVIS: The bear is just here.

1752
02:00:00,552 --> 02:00:03,403
LAURA: The bear ran out into the woods. It's right
that way.

1753
02:00:03,403 --> 02:00:10,671
MARISHA: I know, but I think we should follow it
towards one of the mining--

1754
02:00:10,671 --> 02:00:13,856
TRAVIS: Is anyone adept at tracking such an
animal?

1755
02:00:13,856 --> 02:00:19,923
LIAM: I pull out the sharpened crucifix I have.
It's that way, and I just walk off.

1756
02:00:19,923 --> 02:00:25,271
MATT: Towards the woods? You guys watch as your
reverend fellow walks off into the woods.

1757
02:00:25,271 --> 02:00:27,037
MARISHA: Well, it's a start.

1758
02:00:27,037 --> 02:00:28,512
LAURA: We start following him.

1759
02:00:28,512 --> 02:00:29,501
TRAVIS: Yes, of course!

1760
02:00:29,501 --> 02:00:36,653
LAURA: I push Sydney in front of me, and I say,
maybe you should follow behind the reverend there, Sydney.

1761
02:00:36,653 --> 02:00:42,798
TRAVIS: Well, of course, it'd be my pleasure! Shall
we?

1762
02:00:42,798 --> 02:00:47,031
MARISHA: I peg leg behind. (stomping)

1763
02:00:47,031 --> 02:00:50,994
MATT: You guys begin to make your way up into the
woods. At this point, I want to mention real fast

1764
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:53,325
we just hit $65k.

1765
02:00:53,325 --> 02:00:54,887
(cheering)

1766
02:00:54,887 --> 02:01:00,819
MATT: Which is fantastic. That is amazing so we're
going to have a boss named, created with me and

1767
02:01:00,869 --> 02:01:03,623
the community at some point in the near future to
show up in Critical Role.

1768
02:01:03,623 --> 02:01:05,470
LAURA: Oh man!

1769
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:10,069
MATT: If we hit $70k this special one-off, and
what it's about to unveil as it continues, will be

1770
02:01:10,069 --> 02:01:17,054
uploaded to geekandsundry.com by Friday. If we can
hit $75k, it'll be uploaded by Wednesday. Also,

1771
02:01:17,054 --> 02:01:24,289
we're going to be giving out a signed cast
poster of the purple, no longer available,

1772
02:01:24,289 --> 02:01:26,155
showdown poster.

1773
02:01:26,155 --> 02:01:29,298
TRAVIS: Those are like in the vault. They're very
rare.

1774
02:01:29,298 --> 02:01:32,110
MATT: So we're going to sign that poster and give
it away, since that is no longer available, if we

1775
02:01:32,110 --> 02:01:34,994
hit $75k. So anyway.

1776
02:01:34,994 --> 02:01:39,577
LIAM: Welcome Vox Monica, I am Skizzbucket
Tatertaint.

1777
02:01:39,577 --> 02:01:40,779
(laughter)

1778
02:01:40,779 --> 02:01:42,317
LAURA: Why do you keep calling them Vox Monica?

1779
02:01:42,317 --> 02:01:43,752
LIAM: Why not?

1780
02:01:43,752 --> 02:01:47,308
MATT: Don't give them any ideas.

1781
02:01:47,308 --> 02:01:50,239
LIAM: It's going to stick! It's the new hotness.
Come on!

1782
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:59,250
MATT: So as you guys step into the dark forest,
the evening air has definitely consumed this area.

1783
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:05,070
You can hear the crickets in the distance
chirping, and the occasional distant hooting of a

1784
02:02:05,070 --> 02:02:07,042
night owl (owl hooting).

1785
02:02:07,042 --> 02:02:08,941
MARISHA: What does the moon look like?

1786
02:02:08,941 --> 02:02:13,795
MATT: You look up and the moon is a bright vibrant
circular white. It looks to be--

1787
02:02:13,795 --> 02:02:14,831
MARISHA: So it's a full moon?

1788
02:02:14,831 --> 02:02:18,129
MATT: --close to full, or full. And that light is
aiding you to get through some part of the forest

1789
02:02:18,129 --> 02:02:20,332
as scattered as it is amongst the trees.

1790
02:02:20,332 --> 02:02:23,038
MARISHA: Would I have any occult knowledge
about--

1791
02:02:23,038 --> 02:02:25,854
MATT: Make an occult check, knowledge/occult.

1792
02:02:25,854 --> 02:02:28,774
MARISHA: --the moon, and maybe things come out at
the moon times?

1793
02:02:28,774 --> 02:02:30,308
LIAM: (accented) That is a moon.

1794
02:02:30,308 --> 02:02:33,204
MARISHA: (accented) That is a moon in the skies.

1795
02:02:33,204 --> 02:02:34,626
(dice hitting the floor)

1796
02:02:34,626 --> 02:02:35,660
MARISHA: Oh noes.

1797
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:36,447
LIAM: Fail.

1798
02:02:36,447 --> 02:02:39,500
MARISHA: Oh it was a four, can I keep it? You're
not going to let me keep it.

1799
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:40,680
MATT: On the table.

1800
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:45,421
MARISHA: Three. I'm going to spend a blue to add a
d6, right?

1801
02:02:45,421 --> 02:02:47,052
MATT: Yep, thank you.

1802
02:02:47,052 --> 02:02:51,898
MARISHA: Ooh, and a four. So seven!

1803
02:02:51,898 --> 02:03:01,486
MATT: Yes, a full moon's particular furry beasts
with the nasty teeth, various forms of lycanthropy

1804
02:03:01,486 --> 02:03:07,868
are affected at this point in time. Based on the
information that these attacks happened every few

1805
02:03:07,868 --> 02:03:12,655
weeks, and the cycle of the lunar cycle, you
gather there's probably a very good chance that

1806
02:03:12,655 --> 02:03:16,312
this beast that's been seen multiple times is some
sort of a shapeshifter.

1807
02:03:16,312 --> 02:03:26,701
MARISHA: The full moon, it has mystical powers.
I'd watch out for any type of lycanthropy in the area.

1808
02:03:26,701 --> 02:03:28,785
LAURA: What the fuck is lycanthropy?

1809
02:03:28,785 --> 02:03:31,218
MARISHA: You goods? You've had those hiccups
for--

1810
02:03:31,218 --> 02:03:33,094
LIAM: (spits) Ugh.

1811
02:03:33,094 --> 02:03:34,893
LAURA: What did you eat, son?

1812
02:03:34,893 --> 02:03:37,289
LIAM: I don't know what happened last night.

1813
02:03:37,289 --> 02:03:42,110
MARISHA: You shouldn't eat from the traveling
street carts. Those are bad.

1814
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:45,140
LIAM: I have a lot of praying to do.

1815
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:51,095
TRAVIS: Would you pray for me as well? It burns
when I pee. I think it might have had something to

1816
02:03:51,095 --> 02:03:52,202
do with last night.

1817
02:03:52,202 --> 02:03:53,994
MARISHA: Did you also eat from the travelling
street cart?

1818
02:03:53,994 --> 02:03:55,209
TRAVIS: No.

1819
02:03:55,209 --> 02:03:56,833
MARISHA: Don't eat from food trucks!

1820
02:03:56,833 --> 02:03:58,182
TRAVIS: Oh, okay!

1821
02:03:58,182 --> 02:04:00,885
MATT: A couple of things. One, ladies, red chips.

1822
02:04:00,885 --> 02:04:01,698
LAURA: Yeah!

1823
02:04:01,698 --> 02:04:02,768
TRAVIS: Just the ladies?

1824
02:04:02,768 --> 02:04:04,021
LIAM: I sneaked it. It's mine!

1825
02:04:04,021 --> 02:04:05,016
MARISHA: You fucking--

1826
02:04:05,016 --> 02:04:06,307
MATT: The men get black chips.

1827
02:04:06,307 --> 02:04:07,721
TRAVIS: Oh good! At least I have one more now.

1828
02:04:07,721 --> 02:04:09,093
MARISHA: What? Well, that's fine.

1829
02:04:09,093 --> 02:04:12,214
TRAVIS: I have two chips. Two chips! Just saying!

1830
02:04:12,214 --> 02:04:15,317
MATT: Roll a smarts check if you could, Sudeis.

1831
02:04:15,317 --> 02:04:16,458
MARISHA: Just straight smarts?

1832
02:04:16,458 --> 02:04:17,454
MATT: Yes.

1833
02:04:17,454 --> 02:04:18,603
LIAM: (accented) Smart check.

1834
02:04:18,603 --> 02:04:20,321
MATT: Add to the d6 as well, Let's see what you
find.

1835
02:04:20,321 --> 02:04:21,462
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

1836
02:04:21,462 --> 02:04:22,491
LAURA: All right!

1837
02:04:22,491 --> 02:04:25,801
MARISHA: I'm going to re-roll. Do I re-roll both,
or which one?

1838
02:04:25,801 --> 02:04:27,198
MATT: Just one, the big one.

1839
02:04:27,198 --> 02:04:30,908
MARISHA: The big one? That's not great. Ugh.
Five!

1840
02:04:30,908 --> 02:04:33,258
MATT: Five, you add anything to it?

1841
02:04:33,302 --> 02:04:37,301
MARISHA: Don't bait me, Matthew Mercer. I know
what you're doing.

1842
02:04:37,301 --> 02:04:38,508
MATT: You don't have to.

1843
02:04:38,508 --> 02:04:40,191
MARISHA: Trying to get me to use all my tokens.

1844
02:04:40,191 --> 02:04:41,483
MATT: You get more information if you--

1845
02:04:41,483 --> 02:04:42,473
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1846
02:04:42,473 --> 02:04:44,738
MARISHA: (growling) Yeah, the blue one.

1847
02:04:44,738 --> 02:04:45,667
MATT: Okay.

1848
02:04:45,667 --> 02:04:47,475
TRAVIS: If you finish this game and you have chips
on your table---

1849
02:04:47,475 --> 02:04:49,027
MARISHA: No wait. I don't want blue. I want a
red.

1850
02:04:49,027 --> 02:04:51,040
LAURA: No! But no, with the red--

1851
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:52,023
TRAVIS: It's already been done.

1852
02:04:52,023 --> 02:04:53,282
MARISHA: Oh, because he gets one, right?

1853
02:04:53,282 --> 02:04:54,265
LAURA: Do the blue, do the blue.

1854
02:04:54,265 --> 02:04:56,870
MARISHA: All right, I'll just use the blue. I
already threw it to you.

1855
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:57,818
MATT: Add your d6.

1856
02:04:57,818 --> 02:04:58,669
MARISHA: I would like a d6.

1857
02:04:58,669 --> 02:05:00,055
MATT: Like a d6.

1858
02:05:00,055 --> 02:05:01,704
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good, ten!

1859
02:05:01,704 --> 02:05:08,390
MATT: Ten! You do also recall, as you're putting
these beats of information together: full moon,

1860
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:18,242
lycanthropy, seemingly rumours spreading wide
you've heard of silver mines drying up or being

1861
02:05:18,242 --> 02:05:20,067
purchased up.

1862
02:05:20,067 --> 02:05:26,324
MARISHA: You know there are certain things that
really like silver when they're also lycanthropes.

1863
02:05:26,324 --> 02:05:30,058
LAURA: What <i>the fuck</i> is that word you're
saying?

1864
02:05:30,058 --> 02:05:31,270
TRAVIS: Like, or don't like?

1865
02:05:31,270 --> 02:05:32,483
MARISHA: Like.

1866
02:05:32,483 --> 02:05:34,006
LAURA: Like.

1867
02:05:34,006 --> 02:05:41,090
MARISHA: I don't know, do I know things that might
like silver?

1868
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:43,073
MATT: People like silver.

1869
02:05:43,073 --> 02:05:44,359
MARISHA: I know certain things are afraid of
silver.

1870
02:05:44,359 --> 02:05:45,330
MATT: Werewolves--

1871
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:46,460
MARISHA: They hate silver.

1872
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:48,605
MATT: For werewolves, lycanthropes, it's the only
thing that can kill them.

1873
02:05:48,605 --> 02:05:49,446
TRAVIS: Thank you!

1874
02:05:49,446 --> 02:05:59,110
MARISHA: My immediate thought would be, if I was
werewolf--

1875
02:05:59,110 --> 02:06:03,010
LAURA: There's a, wait. What are we talking about
werewolves? I thought it was a bear?

1876
02:06:03,010 --> 02:06:05,134
MARISHA: That's what lycanthropes are,
werewolves.

1877
02:06:05,134 --> 02:06:07,226
LAURA: Oh! I understand.

1878
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:11,225
LIAM: Is that a thing that we would all know
about in this--?

1879
02:06:11,225 --> 02:06:17,529
MATT: Folklore has heard stories and such, you've
never encountered one. It's occasionally maybe

1880
02:06:17,529 --> 02:06:21,288
heard of in fairy tales and such, times have been
weird as of late.

1881
02:06:21,288 --> 02:06:30,441
MARISHA: If I was werewolf and had vulnerability
to silver, I'd want to control all the silver. So...

1882
02:06:30,441 --> 02:06:31,712
LAURA: Oh.

1883
02:06:31,712 --> 02:06:35,920
MARISHA: That way no one can hurt me.

1884
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,788
LAURA: So we got a big old wolf trying to
quarantine off--

1885
02:06:39,788 --> 02:06:43,271
MARISHA: Or a bear, or it could be other beasts.

1886
02:06:43,271 --> 02:06:47,517
TRAVIS: Wait, wait, wait, didn't Swearengen say
that Cy had bought all of the gold and silver

1887
02:06:47,517 --> 02:06:49,818
mines? You don't think that Cy could be...

1888
02:06:49,818 --> 02:06:57,536
MATT: He didn't say that Cy did. He said that
they'd been purchased up. Cy had lost a lot of

1889
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:59,144
money. He's worried that Hurst might be buying
them up.

1890
02:06:59,144 --> 02:07:00,985
TRAVIS: Oh yes, George Hurst, actually.

1891
02:07:00,985 --> 02:07:08,688
MARISHA: I also saw Cy run very quickly right
before the moon came out.

1892
02:07:08,688 --> 02:07:12,368
TRAVIS: Troubling.

1893
02:07:12,368 --> 02:07:13,463
MARISHA: Just saying.

1894
02:07:13,463 --> 02:07:15,067
TRAVIS: Troubling. Troubling thoughts.

1895
02:07:15,067 --> 02:07:18,646
MARISHA: I think we should keep an eye on Simon.

1896
02:07:18,646 --> 02:07:23,772
LAURA: Should we keep looking for a wolf then, or
should we talk to these people in town that

1897
02:07:23,772 --> 02:07:25,297
you think might be a wolf?

1898
02:07:25,297 --> 02:07:28,054
TRAVIS: I think George Hurst's establishment would
be a good place to visit.

1899
02:07:28,054 --> 02:07:30,420
LIAM: Is our trail cold here?

1900
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:34,023
MATT: You guys are deep in the forest. Where are
you going? Are you heading towards--

1901
02:07:34,023 --> 02:07:40,583
MARISHA: If it's full moon then he's out in beast
form. We have good chance of finding him in beast form.

1902
02:07:40,583 --> 02:07:42,088
MATT: Who wants to make a tracking check?

1903
02:07:42,088 --> 02:07:43,245
LAURA: I'll try.

1904
02:07:43,245 --> 02:07:44,399
TRAVIS: I would love to.

1905
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:46,914
LAURA: But I don't got a thing.

1906
02:07:46,914 --> 02:07:48,330
TRAVIS: Is it tracking-- yeah, it's tracking.

1907
02:07:48,330 --> 02:07:49,649
LIAM: Can we all make a tracking check?

1908
02:07:49,649 --> 02:07:52,159
MATT: You can all make a tracking check, all
unskilled I'm pretty sure.

1909
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:56,652
LIAM: And then do we roll-- if you've got no skill
in it, is it two d4s?

1910
02:07:56,652 --> 02:07:58,861
MATT: No, it's a d4 and a d6, and then minus two.

1911
02:07:58,861 --> 02:08:00,215
LAURA: Oh, I did it wrong.

1912
02:08:00,215 --> 02:08:02,094
MARISHA: So do you add the d4 and the d6
together?

1913
02:08:02,094 --> 02:08:04,043
MATT: No. You take the higher of the two.

1914
02:08:04,043 --> 02:08:06,242
LAURA: And if you get the top, you get to roll
again?

1915
02:08:06,242 --> 02:08:07,836
MATT: Yeah.

1916
02:08:07,836 --> 02:08:08,764
LIAM: Two!

1917
02:08:08,764 --> 02:08:09,840
MARISHA: Three.

1918
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,393
TRAVIS: Six, four.

1919
02:08:11,393 --> 02:08:12,864
LAURA: 16.

1920
02:08:12,864 --> 02:08:14,031
MATT: Minus two, 14.

1921
02:08:14,031 --> 02:08:14,980
LAURA: 14.

1922
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:16,207
TRAVIS: That was a good stack.

1923
02:08:16,207 --> 02:08:17,075
LAURA: That was.

1924
02:08:17,075 --> 02:08:20,266
MATT: So as you all are lost entirely in the
middle of this forest, middle of the night, the

1925
02:08:20,266 --> 02:08:23,616
moonlight the only thing that's giving you any
sort of visual reference. All of a sudden, <i>you</i>

1926
02:08:23,616 --> 02:08:26,334
Stinky Ja-- Stinky Jules!

1927
02:08:26,334 --> 02:08:28,614
(laughter)

1928
02:08:28,614 --> 02:08:31,977
LAURA: I wondered what you were going to call me
there!

1929
02:08:31,977 --> 02:08:38,284
MATT: Stinky Jules, you look over and you see
particularly little spats of blood, and larger

1930
02:08:38,284 --> 02:08:44,732
beast tracks, recent ones that scale up this way.
You begin to follow, and you guys follow behind

1931
02:08:44,732 --> 02:08:50,970
Stinky Jules. You come over a ridge looking down
to where a lot of the plots, a lot of the set

1932
02:08:50,970 --> 02:08:56,705
claims are all set up the side and separated with
flags and various markers and such. You can see a

1933
02:08:56,705 --> 02:08:59,407
number of them have been closed and boarded up.

1934
02:08:59,407 --> 02:09:03,756
MARISHA: The mines?

1935
02:09:03,756 --> 02:09:05,512
TRAVIS: What do you see?

1936
02:09:05,512 --> 02:09:11,764
LAURA: Uh... a bunch of things have been boarded
up. Can we take them down and go in the place?

1937
02:09:11,764 --> 02:09:15,184
MATT: If you want to, there's a number of ones you
can go and check out.

1938
02:09:15,184 --> 02:09:19,773
TRAVIS: Not in the terribly condemned, 
haunted-looking--

1939
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:21,508
LAURA: Why don't you lead the way, there, Syd?

1940
02:09:21,508 --> 02:09:22,475
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Me?

1941
02:09:22,475 --> 02:09:24,386
LAURA: Yeah, you look like you're capable.

1942
02:09:24,386 --> 02:09:28,864
TRAVIS: Look, I've already got quite a bit of blood
on my sleeve. I was not quite prepared for this.

1943
02:09:28,864 --> 02:09:34,570
Maybe I could draw the outside of this
establishment. I'll go, all right, fine.

1944
02:09:34,570 --> 02:09:35,922
LAURA: Yeah. All right.

1945
02:09:35,922 --> 02:09:38,295
TRAVIS: And I'll go up to the entrance of the
mine?

1946
02:09:38,295 --> 02:09:42,462
MATT: It's a campsite that is currently abandoned,
and it looks like it's been abandoned for a while.

1947
02:09:42,462 --> 02:09:46,309
There are a number of wooden boards that are
placed up against the entrance. You look around

1948
02:09:46,309 --> 02:09:56,293
and you can see a bunch of leftover discarded mining
materials and what looks like most of the remnants

1949
02:09:56,293 --> 02:10:02,686
or the scraps that are left behind in one of the
big mining carts that's currently outside-- make a

1950
02:10:02,686 --> 02:10:05,515
notice check. This'd be investigation, make an
investigation.

1951
02:10:05,515 --> 02:10:07,837
TRAVIS: Investigation, okay.

1952
02:10:07,837 --> 02:10:12,456
Ooh, four.

1953
02:10:12,456 --> 02:10:13,408
LAURA: Ooh.

1954
02:10:13,408 --> 02:10:15,183
TRAVIS: Ooh, five! I'll take the five.

1955
02:10:15,183 --> 02:10:18,798
MATT: You glance around and look inside this and
look around the exterior of it. The dust around

1956
02:10:18,798 --> 02:10:21,710
here is silver specifically in nature. This is a
silver mine.

1957
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:28,611
TRAVIS: My fellows, this appears to be a silver
mine. Crazy.

1958
02:10:28,611 --> 02:10:31,819
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1959
02:10:31,819 --> 02:10:34,943
LAURA: Right. Should we look inside the mine?

1960
02:10:34,943 --> 02:10:38,839
LIAM: Yeah, whatever this thing is a scourge.

1961
02:10:38,839 --> 02:10:41,640
LAURA: Do we see tracks of a beast around?

1962
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:47,020
MATT: The beast tracks faded once it got over the
ridge and went down to the claim area, so...

1963
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:52,802
LAURA: What about this little bear cub that we got
with us. Does he smell anything around?

1964
02:10:52,802 --> 02:11:04,847
MATT: (laughs) I'll roll for the bear cub. Bear
cub kind of (sniffing), (cute growl) kind of

1965
02:11:04,847 --> 02:11:06,478
leans up against you.

1966
02:11:06,478 --> 02:11:10,183
LAURA: Tell you what, he's useless, but he sure is
damn cute.

1967
02:11:10,183 --> 02:11:11,245
TRAVIS: Yes, he is.

1968
02:11:11,245 --> 02:11:12,838
MARISHA: I still say we use him as bait.

1969
02:11:12,838 --> 02:11:17,459
LIAM: Also, I don't understand. Are we saying that
silver is a danger to these creatures? Is that

1970
02:11:17,459 --> 02:11:21,667
what you're implying? Why would he have run into
the middle of a silver mine?

1971
02:11:21,667 --> 02:11:23,237
MARISHA: Probably wouldn't have.

1972
02:11:23,237 --> 02:11:28,546
TRAVIS: Unless he was wounded by the gun that poor
late Charlie was holding.

1973
02:11:28,546 --> 02:11:34,380
LIAM: It doesn't make sense, if silver is a bane
to these creatures it wouldn't have run right into

1974
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:35,896
the heart of it.

1975
02:11:35,896 --> 02:11:41,351
TRAVIS: It must be empty, then. Stinky Jane, um,
Jules. Why don't you take a look inside?

1976
02:11:41,351 --> 02:11:46,383
LAURA: All right. I go and look inside the mine.

1977
02:11:46,383 --> 02:11:49,317
MATT: Okay, so you pry open some of the board--

1978
02:11:49,317 --> 02:11:51,075
LAURA: Yeah, pull back some of that wood.

1979
02:11:51,075 --> 02:11:58,588
MATT: The air is dry and musty in there. You get a
few feet in and it's pitch black. There's no light.

1980
02:11:58,588 --> 02:12:02,672
LAURA: Do we got any sort of-- I've got some
matches.

1981
02:12:02,672 --> 02:12:03,753
TRAVIS: I do too!

1982
02:12:03,753 --> 02:12:04,758
MARISHA: I've got a lantern.

1983
02:12:04,758 --> 02:12:07,599
LAURA: Oh! Hey, who's got a lantern?

1984
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:10,828
MARISHA: I come in with a lantern.

1985
02:12:10,828 --> 02:12:16,401
TRAVIS: Lead the way. I'm sure it's totally empty.
I'm right behind you.

1986
02:12:16,401 --> 02:12:19,003
LIAM: I'm going to walk behind.

1987
02:12:19,003 --> 02:12:20,220
MARISHA: Come on, Jules.

1988
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:22,590
LAURA: All right.

1989
02:12:22,590 --> 02:12:25,381
MARISHA: The ladies are leading the way. What do we
see?

1990
02:12:25,381 --> 02:12:31,714
MATT: You guys glance inside. You walk about 20,
30 feet into the mine before it opens into two

1991
02:12:31,714 --> 02:12:34,435
different paths. But immediate at a glance, as--

1992
02:12:34,435 --> 02:12:36,425
LAURA: I'm holding my hand above my pistol.

1993
02:12:36,425 --> 02:12:43,275
MATT: Okay. You look down both sides of the split
Y formation deep into this mine, and you can see

1994
02:12:43,275 --> 02:12:46,992
areas that have been heavily mined. But the thing
that catches your attention is, for being boarded

1995
02:12:46,992 --> 02:12:54,697
up and abandoned, there's still a lot of apparent
silver veins in the walls that are in the middle

1996
02:12:54,697 --> 02:13:02,787
of being mined before they were left behind. You
see visible veins, even this quickly in.

1997
02:13:02,787 --> 02:13:05,205
LAURA: Looks like somebody's trying to--

1998
02:13:05,205 --> 02:13:06,687
LIAM: (hiccups and spits)

1999
02:13:06,687 --> 02:13:11,409
LAURA: Watch them feathers. Somebody's trying to
keep people from getting this silver.

2000
02:13:11,409 --> 02:13:16,159
LIAM: Chat loves a serial killer.

2001
02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:17,527
LAURA: What?

2002
02:13:17,527 --> 02:13:19,918
TRAVIS: I take offence to that, good sir.

2003
02:13:19,918 --> 02:13:24,356
MARISHA: So they bought the mine simply to--

2004
02:13:24,356 --> 02:13:25,942
LAURA and MARISHA: Shut it down.

2005
02:13:25,942 --> 02:13:27,093
MARISHA: Da.

2006
02:13:27,093 --> 02:13:28,723
LAURA: We should get some of that silver though.

2007
02:13:28,723 --> 02:13:29,811
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

2008
02:13:29,811 --> 02:13:30,811
MARISHA: All right.

2009
02:13:30,811 --> 02:13:35,107
TRAVIS: Should we explore, perhaps see if anything
was left behind?

2010
02:13:35,107 --> 02:13:39,154
LAURA: Well, I see some silver's left behind. And I
try to get some.

2011
02:13:39,154 --> 02:13:41,772
MARISHA: We should probably get silver-- yeah. Can
we get some silver pieces?

2012
02:13:41,772 --> 02:13:47,534
MATT: Yeah, and actually it takes you about half
an hour or so, but you manage to scrounge up some

2013
02:13:47,534 --> 02:13:54,264
decent chunks of silver. Probably about five
pounds' worth, which is quite a bit.

2014
02:13:54,264 --> 02:14:02,553
LAURA: I don't want to cart around that much. I'm
going to take about a pound of it. Stick it in my shirt.

2015
02:14:02,553 --> 02:14:04,415
MARISHA: I'll take the other four pounds.

2016
02:14:04,415 --> 02:14:05,479
LAURA: All right.

2017
02:14:05,479 --> 02:14:07,048
MATT: (laughs) All right.

2018
02:14:07,048 --> 02:14:09,833
LAURA: What's wrong with your damn wrist?

2019
02:14:09,833 --> 02:14:12,633
TRAVIS: It-- it does pulse quite a bit.

2020
02:14:12,633 --> 02:14:13,782
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

2021
02:14:13,782 --> 02:14:15,882
LAURA: All right, give it to me. I'll take a look
at it again.

2022
02:14:15,882 --> 02:14:18,068
TRAVIS: I'm quite thirsty too. I have a bit of
cottonmouth going on.

2023
02:14:18,068 --> 02:14:19,527
LAURA: I'll just keep on pushing.

2024
02:14:19,527 --> 02:14:23,917
TRAVIS: (pained) Motherfuck-- I would appreciate
it if you didn't quite press on it quite that hard.

2025
02:14:23,917 --> 02:14:25,940
LAURA: Something's weird with this guy.

2026
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:28,779
LIAM: Is there any hair coming out of that hand?

2027
02:14:28,779 --> 02:14:31,515
MATT: Nope, not that you can see. Make a notice
check.

2028
02:14:31,515 --> 02:14:35,223
LIAM: Okay. Uh, no idea what that is. What do I
roll?

2029
02:14:35,223 --> 02:14:36,489
MARISHA: 1d4.

2030
02:14:36,489 --> 02:14:38,056
LAURA: And then minus two.

2031
02:14:38,056 --> 02:14:40,682
MATT: You're not very good at noticing things.
You're a faithful man. You take faith--

2032
02:14:40,682 --> 02:14:42,201
LIAM: All right, three plus--

2033
02:14:42,201 --> 02:14:43,810
MATT: The d6 to see which is higher.

2034
02:14:43,810 --> 02:14:44,832
LAURA: Yeah, you also roll a d6.

2035
02:14:44,832 --> 02:14:54,557
LIAM: Thanks man. Five minus two is three. And I'm
going to waste a blue. So that's a three plus two

2036
02:14:54,557 --> 02:14:56,024
is five.

2037
02:14:56,024 --> 02:14:56,880
MATT: Okay.

2038
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:57,870
LIAM: I'll settle at five.

2039
02:14:57,870 --> 02:14:59,050
TRAVIS: Toss that blue. Send it flying.

2040
02:14:59,050 --> 02:15:03,452
MATT: Best you can tell, based on the wound, it's
a mild wound. It's a little swollen. It seems to

2041
02:15:03,452 --> 02:15:05,953
be fine, but no other visual effect than that.

2042
02:15:05,953 --> 02:15:12,512
TRAVIS: (pants) It's so hot in here, isn't it? I
do feel perhaps it's the lantern (pants) and I'll

2043
02:15:12,512 --> 02:15:15,573
actually take off the outer coat and really just
roll up the shirt.

2044
02:15:15,573 --> 02:15:16,780
MATT: Big pit stains.

2045
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:18,329
LIAM: Are you sure you don't want a poultice on
that?

2046
02:15:18,329 --> 02:15:19,892
LAURA: Do you want to hold some of that silver?

2047
02:15:19,892 --> 02:15:23,207
LIAM: It's really a simple thing for me to do, to
wrap some mud and some water.

2048
02:15:23,207 --> 02:15:26,173
TRAVIS: I feel like I'm earning my marks. I'm
quite proud.

2049
02:15:26,173 --> 02:15:28,855
MATT: You hear from the far, far depths of the
mine--

2050
02:15:28,855 --> 02:15:29,974
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

2051
02:15:29,974 --> 02:15:32,091
MATT: A faint sound going, not "All right".

2052
02:15:32,091 --> 02:15:33,274
(laughter)

2053
02:15:33,274 --> 02:15:38,516
MATT: It goes, (creepy exhale).

2054
02:15:38,516 --> 02:15:39,595
LAURA: Oh shit.

2055
02:15:39,595 --> 02:15:41,368
MATT: A deep echoing exhale from deeper in the
mine.

2056
02:15:41,368 --> 02:15:45,547
TRAVIS: Oh no. Um. I don't suppose any of you had
gas, just then?

2057
02:15:45,547 --> 02:15:49,669
LAURA: Well, I did, but it's usually silent.

2058
02:15:49,669 --> 02:15:53,903
MATT: (creepy exhale) It's still a ways away, but
it's getting slowly louder.

2059
02:15:53,903 --> 02:15:55,109
LAURA: What the fuck is that?

2060
02:15:55,109 --> 02:15:56,209
TRAVIS: Uh, hello?

2061
02:15:56,209 --> 02:15:57,564
MARISHA: We should go deeper.

2062
02:15:57,564 --> 02:15:58,970
LAURA: I bet that thing's in here!

2063
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:00,287
TRAVIS: What thing? No!

2064
02:16:00,287 --> 02:16:06,855
LIAM: Well, we have to make a choice. We either go
in now, stop it from escaping, if it's our killer.

2065
02:16:06,855 --> 02:16:08,504
Or go back for reinforcements.

2066
02:16:08,504 --> 02:16:09,711
LAURA: Let's go kill it!

2067
02:16:09,711 --> 02:16:11,888
TRAVIS: Yes, but could we take a moment to
consider that it was boarded up?

2068
02:16:11,888 --> 02:16:15,117
LAURA: I want to go kill it.

2069
02:16:15,117 --> 02:16:16,818
LIAM: I take out my crucifix and lead the way.

2070
02:16:16,818 --> 02:16:18,052
LAURA: Yeah! Let's go.

2071
02:16:18,052 --> 02:16:22,509
MARISHA: Before we walk off I go, Sydney, catch!
And I toss him a piece of silver.

2072
02:16:22,509 --> 02:16:23,426
MATT: Okay.

2073
02:16:23,426 --> 02:16:25,154
TRAVIS: Oh! Thank you. What is this for?

2074
02:16:25,154 --> 02:16:27,396
MARISHA: Just...

2075
02:16:27,396 --> 02:16:29,679
TRAVIS: Last night? Yes, jolly good!

2076
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:32,934
MARISHA: I thought it'd be good if we all had
some.

2077
02:16:32,934 --> 02:16:37,634
MATT: All right, you guys begin to curl around the
left side where the sound's coming from, and as

2078
02:16:37,634 --> 02:16:39,298
you come into a larger mining chamber--

2079
02:16:39,298 --> 02:16:42,036
LAURA: I'm holding up silver and I got my hand on
my pistol.

2080
02:16:42,036 --> 02:16:43,340
MATT: You see--

2081
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:45,641
MARISHA: I've got the lantern.

2082
02:16:45,641 --> 02:16:50,801
MATT: --not a furry creature. As your lantern passes
by, all of a sudden it catches a darker shadowed

2083
02:16:50,845 --> 02:16:58,151
shape that looks like a human but with a larger
head than normal. Its body is black and bulbous

2084
02:16:58,151 --> 02:17:03,518
and it looks almost shiny like it's covered in
oil, but that's its natural form. It glances over

2085
02:17:03,518 --> 02:17:07,512
real fast and its eyes glow as it flashes in the
light and (hisses) it scatters out of the light--

2086
02:17:07,512 --> 02:17:08,407
LAURA: Ugh, I shoot it!

2087
02:17:08,547 --> 02:17:09,721
MATT: --into a far corner. You're going to shoot
it?

2088
02:17:09,721 --> 02:17:10,613
LAURA: Yeah!

2089
02:17:10,613 --> 02:17:14,531
MATT: All right, go ahead and make your shooting
skill check.

2090
02:17:14,531 --> 02:17:16,140
LIAM: Are her bullets still smited?

2091
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:18,153
MATT: No, the smite only lasts for a few rounds.

2092
02:17:18,153 --> 02:17:19,223
LIAM: God damn it!

2093
02:17:19,223 --> 02:17:20,020
MATT: Yeah.

2094
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:21,022
LIAM: I mean, God bless it!

2095
02:17:21,022 --> 02:17:22,088
(laughter)

2096
02:17:22,088 --> 02:17:23,339
LAURA: What do I roll for this?

2097
02:17:23,339 --> 02:17:24,828
LIAM: You're asking me?

2098
02:17:24,828 --> 02:17:29,276
LAURA: What's R.O.F? Is that what I roll-- a six?
Do I roll a d6?

2099
02:17:29,276 --> 02:17:31,433
MATT: You do.

2100
02:17:31,433 --> 02:17:32,515
LAURA: Okay.

2101
02:17:32,515 --> 02:17:33,926
LIAM: 2d-- oh, that's the damage.

2102
02:17:33,926 --> 02:17:36,918
LAURA: I'm going to re-roll.

2103
02:17:36,918 --> 02:17:39,399
MATT: d6 on your shooting? Your shooting is a d10,
I think.

2104
02:17:39,399 --> 02:17:40,685
LAURA: Oh shit! Awesome.

2105
02:17:40,685 --> 02:17:42,110
MATT: Look where it is. I think it's pretty high.

2106
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:43,783
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a d10.

2107
02:17:43,783 --> 02:17:46,978
LAURA: Okay. All right.

2108
02:17:46,978 --> 02:17:48,702
MATT: And what was the d6?

2109
02:17:48,702 --> 02:17:50,914
LAURA: It was uh-- oh, a d6. I didn't--

2110
02:17:50,914 --> 02:17:52,376
MATT: Yeah, as well with that one.

2111
02:17:52,376 --> 02:17:54,841
LAURA: So that was a nine total.

2112
02:17:54,841 --> 02:17:56,221
MATT: What's the lower of the two?

2113
02:17:56,221 --> 02:18:00,801
LAURA: The lower of the two is a four. So it adds
to eight.

2114
02:18:00,801 --> 02:18:04,621
MATT: Right, as the bear-- is this you
re-rolling?

2115
02:18:04,621 --> 02:18:05,782
LAURA: Yeah.

2116
02:18:05,782 --> 02:18:07,362
TRAVIS: Yeah, she wanted to re-roll the trait
die.

2117
02:18:07,362 --> 02:18:10,283
MATT: Okay, got you. And the six was a four?

2118
02:18:10,283 --> 02:18:11,680
LAURA: Yes.

2119
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:17,130
MATT: Okay, so the bear, thinking that you're its
mother and sees suddenly the fear, runs to your

2120
02:18:17,130 --> 02:18:21,133
side and clings to you and in doing so disables
your shot, and you have to go with the lower

2121
02:18:21,133 --> 02:18:22,259
strike on that one.

2122
02:18:22,259 --> 02:18:23,149
LAURA: Damn it!

2123
02:18:23,149 --> 02:18:24,308
MATT: But you do get a black chip from that one.

2124
02:18:24,308 --> 02:18:25,419
LAURA: Well, that's good. Hand it over.

2125
02:18:25,419 --> 02:18:29,672
MATT: And the bear is heavily-- Blue chip to you
Liam.

2126
02:18:29,672 --> 02:18:32,560
LIAM: Oh my god, that was your boob.

2127
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:34,510
MARISHA: I'm great, it was my knee. My knee
deflected.

2128
02:18:34,510 --> 02:18:38,019
MATT: The bear is shaking against you and making
it harder to shoot. The gun ricochets off the far

2129
02:18:38,019 --> 02:18:39,838
back wall, sparking across the stone.

2130
02:18:39,838 --> 02:18:41,105
LAURA: I'm pushing the bear off my leg.

2131
02:18:41,105 --> 02:18:42,138
MATT: And you hear once again (creepy breathing).

2132
02:18:42,138 --> 02:18:43,861
TRAVIS: I said that's supposed to be mine!

2133
02:18:43,861 --> 02:18:48,272
MATT: Heavy breathing. I'll have you guys go ahead
and each draw a card at random from your deck.

2134
02:18:48,272 --> 02:18:49,602
LAURA: Oh jeez. Okay.

2135
02:18:49,602 --> 02:18:51,399
LIAM: Shuffle one more time.

2136
02:18:51,399 --> 02:18:52,531
LAURA: You're going to shuffle it?

2137
02:18:52,531 --> 02:18:55,837
LIAM: Hey, question, way earlier in the game, as I
shuffle my cards, you said that I gained two

2138
02:18:55,880 --> 02:18:59,605
miracle points back. It's been a while. Do I, or
do I not?

2139
02:18:59,605 --> 02:19:02,374
MATT: You gain one more back, so you've gained
three total of what you've used.

2140
02:19:02,374 --> 02:19:08,012
LIAM: So, say that last bit again? Because I
thought I was down to one, so if you're giving me

2141
02:19:08,012 --> 02:19:09,449
one, now I have two?

2142
02:19:09,449 --> 02:19:10,811
TRAVIS: Ladies first. Pick a card.

2143
02:19:10,811 --> 02:19:12,378
MATT: You've cast three miracles, correct?

2144
02:19:12,378 --> 02:19:17,311
LIAM: Oh Jesus, I don't know. I was marking it
down and, before I asked you that question, I was

2145
02:19:17,311 --> 02:19:18,598
at one point.

2146
02:19:18,598 --> 02:19:21,851
MATT: How did you get one point? How much do your
miracles cost?

2147
02:19:21,851 --> 02:19:24,025
LIAM: I did a lot of shit, man! I thought it was
two a miracle.

2148
02:19:24,025 --> 02:19:25,391
MATT: It should say on them. Then yeah--

2149
02:19:25,391 --> 02:19:28,507
LIAM: I healed a couple of people. I smited her
bullets.

2150
02:19:28,507 --> 02:19:30,005
MATT: Right. So that would be--

2151
02:19:30,005 --> 02:19:31,091
LIAM: Three?

2152
02:19:31,091 --> 02:19:38,025
MATT: Three uses. Four uses, but you've regained
three. So you would have been at two, to five.

2153
02:19:38,025 --> 02:19:39,547
LIAM: So I'm at five now?

2154
02:19:39,547 --> 02:19:40,599
MATT: You're at five now.

2155
02:19:40,599 --> 02:19:41,383
LIAM: Okay.

2156
02:19:41,383 --> 02:19:42,338
LAURA: Wow. Did you pull a card?

2157
02:19:42,338 --> 02:19:43,522
LIAM: I did not. I'm going to pull this one.

2158
02:19:43,522 --> 02:19:44,625
LAURA: Oh Jesus, really?!

2159
02:19:44,625 --> 02:19:45,654
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

2160
02:19:45,654 --> 02:19:47,258
LAURA: Do you see what just happened, with the
three of these?

2161
02:19:47,258 --> 02:19:52,886
MATT: Wow, that's great! Great! And what do you
have Laura? A jack. Okay. First things first. As

2162
02:19:52,886 --> 02:19:55,151
you were not quite fast enough--

2163
02:19:55,151 --> 02:19:56,573
MARISHA: Can we use fate chips to redraw cards?

2164
02:19:56,573 --> 02:19:57,484
MATT: Nope! (chuckles)

2165
02:19:57,484 --> 02:19:58,529
MARISHA: Fucking fuck!

2166
02:19:58,529 --> 02:20:04,223
MATT: This strange creature who's keeping in the
shadows just outside your lantern-light, you hear

2167
02:20:04,223 --> 02:20:09,694
the (rasping growl), and it lunges out at you, being
the closest to it. It swoops out towards you. You

2168
02:20:09,694 --> 02:20:13,806
can see it's bulbous, it's only about three feet
tall in its size, but its larger head is

2169
02:20:13,806 --> 02:20:19,319
awful-looking and it's just a terrible-looking
thing, large saucers for its face. It strikes out

2170
02:20:19,319 --> 02:20:23,734
towards you with two of its claws. I want you all
to go ahead and roll a guts roll, by the way.

2171
02:20:23,734 --> 02:20:25,883
LAURA: Guts roll. Oh, jeez.

2172
02:20:25,883 --> 02:20:27,010
MATT: Minus one.

2173
02:20:27,010 --> 02:20:37,700
LAURA: Man, come on. I'm rerolling, just in case.
Oh, sorry, I should warn you.

2174
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:39,980
MATT: I'm going to reroll that.

2175
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:45,190
MARISHA: No. I'm going to spend a fate chip to
counter your reroll.

2176
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:47,867
MATT: Okay. I'll use another one to reroll.

2177
02:20:47,867 --> 02:20:52,006
TRAVIS: I'm going to add one to mine.

2178
02:20:52,006 --> 02:20:54,366
LIAM: I'm adding.

2179
02:20:54,366 --> 02:20:57,468
LAURA: All right, all right, I'm going to add one
too. I'm going to use my blue and add it.

2180
02:20:57,468 --> 02:20:59,271
MARISHA: Running out of fate chips.

2181
02:20:59,271 --> 02:21:02,482
MATT: All right, so what do you got?

2182
02:21:02,482 --> 02:21:04,869
MARISHA: Three on my guts.

2183
02:21:04,869 --> 02:21:05,852
LIAM: Nine.

2184
02:21:05,852 --> 02:21:06,885
TRAVIS: Five.

2185
02:21:06,885 --> 02:21:07,825
LAURA: Eight.

2186
02:21:07,825 --> 02:21:11,604
MATT: All right. You, everyone else has managed to
take this back. You are finding yourself shaken

2187
02:21:11,604 --> 02:21:16,458
from the perspective of this, and you're now
holding the lantern. There's not much else you can

2188
02:21:16,458 --> 02:21:18,518
do at this moment. When it comes to your turn,
you'll have to see if you can reveal that.

2189
02:21:18,518 --> 02:21:30,239
However, it does swipe out at you. That's going to
be-- so, what is your parry?

2190
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:31,641
LAURA: Five.

2191
02:21:31,641 --> 02:21:40,768
MATT: It rolled a six. It hits you, it strikes
out. You go ahead and suffer, from that, that's

2192
02:21:40,768 --> 02:21:44,527
going to be-- I'm going to go ahead and add a d6
to that.

2193
02:21:44,527 --> 02:21:47,150
MARISHA: What did you use?

2194
02:21:47,150 --> 02:21:54,809
MATT: It was black. All right, that would be eight
points of damage. What's your toughness?

2195
02:21:54,809 --> 02:21:56,496
LAURA: Five.

2196
02:21:56,496 --> 02:22:01,434
MATT: Five. You are shaken right now as it strikes
out at you, and strikes its claw across your

2197
02:22:01,434 --> 02:22:05,849
front. You manage to pull it off, and it just
barely cuts the skin, but it's enough to freak you

2198
02:22:05,849 --> 02:22:11,673
out at the moment. That ends its turn. And then
you're up next, actually. At the top of your turn,

2199
02:22:11,673 --> 02:22:14,740
go ahead and make a spirit check to try and regain
your composure.

2200
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:15,943
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

2201
02:22:15,943 --> 02:22:25,721
LAURA: All right, I will! Ooh, yes. Nine.

2202
02:22:25,721 --> 02:22:32,843
MATT: Nine? All right. Black chip here. You shake
it off, you're no longer shaken, but that's all

2203
02:22:32,843 --> 02:22:37,032
you can really do this turn, as you go ahead and
try and steady yourself and start going for your

2204
02:22:37,032 --> 02:22:41,156
gun now to pull it out. I'll say you can pull your
gun out for this turn as well. All right. The rest

2205
02:22:41,156 --> 02:22:45,380
of you guys, now, you go ahead and see if you can
make a spirit check to not be shaken.

2206
02:22:45,380 --> 02:22:50,692
MARISHA: Just roll a d6? 2d6.

2207
02:22:50,692 --> 02:22:54,110
MATT: It would be 2d6 for anything you roll as a
trained check, so yeah.

2208
02:22:54,110 --> 02:22:58,183
MARISHA: Ooh, six. Seven, total.

2209
02:22:58,183 --> 02:23:00,615
MATT: So you're no longer shaken. That's the end
of your turn. You guys, what do you want to do?

2210
02:23:00,615 --> 02:23:01,949
TRAVIS: Go ahead, Father.

2211
02:23:01,949 --> 02:23:04,052
LIAM: I want to stab this thing with my crucifix.

2212
02:23:04,052 --> 02:23:06,243
MATT: Go for it. So go ahead and roll fighting.

2213
02:23:06,243 --> 02:23:16,418
LIAM: Okay, so-- oh, I do have skill in that. So
it's a d4 and a d6? Okay. Four and a four, and I'm

2214
02:23:16,418 --> 02:23:24,050
going to give you a red-- no, I'm going to use a
blue chip and add to that for eight.

2215
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:31,336
MATT: Eight, okay. Versus its-- all right, so two
damage. It is now shaken.

2216
02:23:31,336 --> 02:23:33,205
LIAM: You are not welcome here!

2217
02:23:33,205 --> 02:23:37,284
MATT: As you slam it with the crucifix, (shrieks),
it shrieks back in this high-pitched wail and begins to

2218
02:23:37,284 --> 02:23:42,572
push back into the shadows away from you. But
not far enough away to go ahead and give you a

2219
02:23:42,572 --> 02:23:48,189
secondary melee attack against it, so it's right
in your face, out of the line of the lantern. All

2220
02:23:48,189 --> 02:23:49,694
right, that brings it to you, Travis.

2221
02:23:49,694 --> 02:23:54,684
TRAVIS: I kneel down and I say, oh! Look, a
weapon! And I pull out of my boot a bowie knife,

2222
02:23:54,684 --> 02:23:57,404
and I would like to rush the creature.

2223
02:23:57,404 --> 02:23:58,684
MATT: Go for it.

2224
02:23:58,684 --> 02:24:00,431
LIAM: I really admire you.

2225
02:24:00,431 --> 02:24:02,321
TRAVIS: Oh shit, what do I roll?

2226
02:24:02,321 --> 02:24:04,013
MATT: This would be fighting.

2227
02:24:04,013 --> 02:24:07,799
LIAM: (Sydney voice) There seems to be a railgun
over here.

2228
02:24:07,799 --> 02:24:10,627
TRAVIS: Nine.

2229
02:24:10,627 --> 02:24:14,608
MATT: A d8. Has to be max die.

2230
02:24:14,608 --> 02:24:20,403
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, sorry. That was d6, for
a four. So let me add--

2231
02:24:20,403 --> 02:24:24,068
LAURA: That's a reroll.

2232
02:24:24,068 --> 02:24:29,539
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck, balls, ass. Okay, well, let's
try it. That was worse.

2233
02:24:29,539 --> 02:24:31,209
MATT: Which of the two?

2234
02:24:31,209 --> 02:24:32,876
TRAVIS: The six.

2235
02:24:32,876 --> 02:24:36,900
MATT: Six. Six does hit. Go ahead and roll your
damage. So 2d4 plus two.

2236
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:45,583
TRAVIS: One. Three. Five. A total of five.

2237
02:24:45,583 --> 02:24:51,521
MATT: Toughness of six. You go ahead and strike
with the dagger, and as you hit its hide, it scrapes

2238
02:24:51,521 --> 02:24:56,592
in, but does not appear to leave a wound, its
somewhat crackled, black, shadowy form absorbing

2239
02:24:56,592 --> 02:25:01,355
most of the impact of the blow, and it turns and
hisses at you, its horrible, small, baby-like

2240
02:25:01,355 --> 02:25:06,997
mouth filled with layers of sharp teeth. All
right, your turn back, we're back at the top of

2241
02:25:06,997 --> 02:25:12,772
the round. It goes back. It's now going to lash
out at you, Sydney. It's going to go ahead and

2242
02:25:12,772 --> 02:25:20,746
make its strike at you. I'm going to go ahead and
add six to that. That is-- that's going to be a

2243
02:25:20,746 --> 02:25:22,330
ten. What's your parry?

2244
02:25:22,330 --> 02:25:23,427
TRAVIS: Six.

2245
02:25:23,427 --> 02:25:28,065
MATT: Six, okay. So it does hit you. It is not a
raise, so it doesn't get the additional d6 damage.

2246
02:25:28,065 --> 02:25:31,696
I will spend another blue chip to go ahead and add
a d6 to the damage it's already doing.

2247
02:25:31,696 --> 02:25:34,815
MARISHA: Blue chips, I don't have any blue chips
to counter.

2248
02:25:34,815 --> 02:25:39,031
MATT: All right, that's going to be 11. What's
your toughness?

2249
02:25:39,031 --> 02:25:40,450
TRAVIS: Five.

2250
02:25:40,450 --> 02:25:45,339
MATT: Five, that is six points of damage to you,
so that is considered a raise, so you actually are

2251
02:25:45,339 --> 02:25:49,825
shaken and you take a wound. You are actually
wounded. The creature leaps out and jams its claws

2252
02:25:49,825 --> 02:25:54,032
into your side and bites into your throat. You
freak out and push it back. It doesn't manage to

2253
02:25:54,032 --> 02:25:57,700
pull anything free, but it does leave these giant
bite marks on the side.

2254
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:07,480
TRAVIS: I'm leaking. (yelps) Please! Help me!

2255
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:09,693
MATT: All right, you're up, Stinky Jules.

2256
02:26:09,693 --> 02:26:13,193
LAURA: All right. I want to shoot it a whole bunch
of times. I'm going to fan my hammer.

2257
02:26:13,193 --> 02:26:18,917
MATT: Okay. All right. So your gun's already out.
You're going to go ahead and take all six rounds

2258
02:26:18,917 --> 02:26:20,175
on it, at minus two.

2259
02:26:20,175 --> 02:26:23,393
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it. I have no idea how
that--

2260
02:26:23,393 --> 02:26:26,266
MATT: Make your shooting roll six times, minus two
for each roll.

2261
02:26:26,266 --> 02:26:27,976
LAURA: Okay, so that's just a six?

2262
02:26:27,976 --> 02:26:34,571
MATT: Whatever your shooting is. Shooting is a
d10. You're really good at shooting.

2263
02:26:34,571 --> 02:26:44,752
MARISHA: Hey, that's good! Same thing, yeah, do
it. Nice!

2264
02:26:44,752 --> 02:26:48,512
LAURA: Or wait, I'm going to reroll the third one.
So I got eight on the first two, so that's six for

2265
02:26:48,512 --> 02:26:53,599
the first two, and then I'm going to reroll the
third.

2266
02:26:53,599 --> 02:26:55,255
MATT: They both hit, all right.

2267
02:26:55,255 --> 02:27:00,713
LAURA: That's five on the third hit.

2268
02:27:00,713 --> 02:27:02,456
MATT: Okay, roll the next three.

2269
02:27:02,456 --> 02:27:19,817
LAURA: I'm rerolling this one. Four on the fourth.
Six on the fifth. Rerolling on the sixth one.

2270
02:27:19,817 --> 02:27:26,112
Sorry. Oh shit, off the table. And six on the last
one.

2271
02:27:26,112 --> 02:27:31,447
MATT: You guys watch as there's a series of
flashes in the center of this room as Stinky Jules

2272
02:27:31,447 --> 02:27:38,090
unloads an entire fully loaded gun into this
creature. Go ahead and roll damage for each of them.

2273
02:27:38,090 --> 02:27:40,149
LAURA: Oh my gosh. So did I hit every single
time?

2274
02:27:40,149 --> 02:27:43,593
MATT: Every single one hit. So roll 2d6 for the
first shot.

2275
02:27:43,593 --> 02:27:45,617
LIAM: Jeepers.

2276
02:27:45,617 --> 02:27:48,625
LAURA: Six plus one is seven for the first.

2277
02:27:48,625 --> 02:27:53,003
MATT: All right, so it is-- all right, next one.

2278
02:27:53,003 --> 02:27:56,855
LAURA: Seven for the second.

2279
02:27:56,855 --> 02:27:58,772
MATT: All right, next one.

2280
02:27:58,772 --> 02:28:12,878
LAURA: Ooh! (gasps) 19. Oh my gosh. 24 on the
next.

2281
02:28:12,878 --> 02:28:18,951
MATT: So before you get to the rest of the shots,
you, just screaming, echoing, you unload as this

2282
02:28:18,951 --> 02:28:28,518
creature turns around and its face gets shredded
by a hail of bullets from your gun. As it slumps

2283
02:28:28,518 --> 02:28:33,951
to the ground and turns to ash and shadow before
dissipating with a (sizzling) sound, you're still--

2284
02:28:33,951 --> 02:28:39,022
LIAM: Ease down. Ease down. It's dead.

2285
02:28:39,022 --> 02:28:42,670
LAURA: What the fuck was that thing? What's up,
Lucas?

2286
02:28:42,670 --> 02:28:48,696
MATT: We have ten minutes left on this game to go
ahead and get to $70,000, guys.

2287
02:28:48,696 --> 02:28:50,037
LAURA: How close are we?

2288
02:28:50,037 --> 02:28:51,245
MATT: How close are we?

2289
02:28:51,245 --> 02:28:53,284
OFF-SCREEN: We're at about $68,000.

2290
02:28:53,284 --> 02:28:55,316
TRAVIS: $68,000, just $2,000 away!

2291
02:28:55,316 --> 02:28:56,735
MATT: All right, so.

2292
02:28:56,735 --> 02:29:00,645
LAURA: I used so many of my chips on that one!

2293
02:29:00,645 --> 02:29:02,857
OFF-SCREEN: We're only at $67,000.

2294
02:29:02,857 --> 02:29:04,163
LAURA: Oh, $67,000.

2295
02:29:04,163 --> 02:29:08,832
MATT: So, after the creature's down, you spend a
while searching the mine. Nothing else of this

2296
02:29:08,832 --> 02:29:13,821
type seems to be down here. As you make your way
outside of the mine, you glance and see what looks

2297
02:29:13,821 --> 02:29:19,005
to be in the distance about four individuals
running away who seem to have been tracking you.

2298
02:29:19,005 --> 02:29:24,269
You see them run towards a distant place, into the
shadows--

2299
02:29:24,269 --> 02:29:25,874
MARISHA: How far away are they?

2300
02:29:25,874 --> 02:29:28,011
MATT: About, at this point? 200 feet or so.

2301
02:29:28,011 --> 02:29:31,124
MARISHA: Still far enough away to where I can
shout at them?

2302
02:29:31,124 --> 02:29:32,550
MATT: It's up to you.

2303
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:39,326
MARISHA: Sudis will shout, if you run, only death
will come and find you, and I'm going to attempt

2304
02:29:39,326 --> 02:29:42,114
to try and shaken them.

2305
02:29:42,114 --> 02:29:43,827
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a persuasion roll.

2306
02:29:43,827 --> 02:29:47,251
LAURA: I'm going to reload my gun while we're
leaving the place.

2307
02:29:47,251 --> 02:29:48,977
LIAM: I'm going to bless her bullets.

2308
02:29:48,977 --> 02:29:56,097
MARISHA: Ooh, I rolled an eight with a five, so
that's 13 plus two. 15.

2309
02:29:56,097 --> 02:30:03,532
MATT: All righty. You watch as most of them run
away and one gentleman stops and turns around.

2310
02:30:03,532 --> 02:30:12,055
"Death? I don't want death to follow me!" At which
point, suddenly, you watch as a large cougar leaps

2311
02:30:12,055 --> 02:30:17,380
out and just tears his throat out and starts
chewing into his corpse.

2312
02:30:17,380 --> 02:30:18,608
LIAM: How did you do that?

2313
02:30:18,608 --> 02:30:19,997
MARISHA: I told you. I told you.

2314
02:30:19,997 --> 02:30:21,135
LAURA: A large cougar?

2315
02:30:21,135 --> 02:30:23,132
TRAVIS: That's a big fucking cat.

2316
02:30:23,132 --> 02:30:24,461
LAURA: Should we shoot it?

2317
02:30:24,461 --> 02:30:27,452
MATT: It's large for a cougar, but it's not quite
what you were looking for.

2318
02:30:27,452 --> 02:30:28,705
LAURA: Okay, all right.

2319
02:30:28,705 --> 02:30:29,917
TRAVIS: I mean, there are three of them left,
right?

2320
02:30:29,917 --> 02:30:34,356
MATT: But they've all run into the forest. You
guys have options now. You have some silver at

2321
02:30:34,356 --> 02:30:44,842
your disposal. You have-- hmm, okay. You have
silver at your disposal, you know some entity's

2322
02:30:44,842 --> 02:30:46,271
out there right now. What are you going to do?

2323
02:30:46,271 --> 02:30:51,184
LAURA: Find the fucking entity. We should kill it.
We should kill it while we're on the hunt, I mean,

2324
02:30:51,184 --> 02:30:52,596
we're ahead of it.

2325
02:30:52,596 --> 02:30:55,595
LIAM: Right, but that thing you just killed,
that's not what we were following. We need to

2326
02:30:55,595 --> 02:30:56,733
press on.

2327
02:30:56,733 --> 02:30:59,383
LAURA: Right, but we can find-- what?

2328
02:30:59,383 --> 02:31:05,418
MARISHA: Should we chase after people who were
following us? Or should we maybe check other

2329
02:31:05,418 --> 02:31:06,726
silver mines?

2330
02:31:06,726 --> 02:31:10,382
TRAVIS: (low voice) I think-- (normal voice) I
think we kill the motherfuckers. We chase them down.

2331
02:31:10,382 --> 02:31:14,184
MARISHA: The accent's already rubbing off on you.

2332
02:31:14,184 --> 02:31:19,063
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. I'm losing quite a bit of
blood. Reverend, if you would be so kind.

2333
02:31:19,063 --> 02:31:22,967
LIAM: It's going to take me a couple of minutes.

2334
02:31:22,967 --> 02:31:25,461
LAURA: Can I walk up to him and just punch him in
the gut?

2335
02:31:25,461 --> 02:31:26,612
MATT: Sure.

2336
02:31:26,612 --> 02:31:29,713
TRAVIS: (grunts) (low voice) You fucking bitch!
And I hit her back.

2337
02:31:29,713 --> 02:31:36,346
MATT: Smack across the face. You feel the pain and
sting on the side of your cheek.

2338
02:31:36,346 --> 02:31:40,146
LAURA: What the fuck are you?

2339
02:31:40,146 --> 02:31:42,776
TRAVIS: I'm terribly sorry, I have quite the
temper.

2340
02:31:42,776 --> 02:31:44,188
LAURA: What's going on with you?

2341
02:31:44,188 --> 02:31:45,838
TRAVIS: I'm bleeding from the throat.

2342
02:31:45,838 --> 02:31:47,143
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

2343
02:31:47,143 --> 02:31:51,660
(laughter)

2344
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:53,343
TRAVIS: Please--

2345
02:31:53,343 --> 02:31:58,231
LAURA: Are you the monster we're looking for? I
take out the silver and I push it on this face.

2346
02:31:58,231 --> 02:32:00,595
MATT: It does nothing.

2347
02:32:00,595 --> 02:32:02,174
LAURA: I take it and I push it on his hand.

2348
02:32:02,174 --> 02:32:04,637
TRAVIS: Besides the pressure, it's doing nothing,
my dear.

2349
02:32:04,637 --> 02:32:10,744
MATT: You watch, at this point, as stepping out of
the sunlight you see E.B. Farnum walking out with

2350
02:32:10,744 --> 02:32:16,960
his hat. He goes, "They're right there." And he
turns away to the side, and you see stepping out

2351
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:25,742
as well the gentleman Simon you met earlier and a
few other individuals. You see, holding a couple

2352
02:32:25,742 --> 02:32:34,058
of guns trained on you, standing in the center, Cy
Tolliver. You see him step out. His outfit is

2353
02:32:34,058 --> 02:32:44,501
shredded. He's like, "If you guys had all just
decided to not go poking where it didn't belong--"

2354
02:32:44,501 --> 02:32:48,513
LIAM: We can handle this peacefully! Stinky, put
your gun down. And I bless her bullets.

2355
02:32:48,513 --> 02:32:55,142
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a faith check.

2356
02:32:55,142 --> 02:32:58,210
We just hit $70,000, guys.

2357
02:32:58,210 --> 02:33:00,417
(cheering)

2358
02:33:00,417 --> 02:33:02,075
LAURA: Good job, guys!

2359
02:33:02,075 --> 02:33:10,011
LIAM: I'm going to add to that with a red, so it's
six plus two is eight.

2360
02:33:10,011 --> 02:33:14,075
MATT: Eight. That is a single raise, so you do
plus four damage for the next three rounds.

2361
02:33:14,075 --> 02:33:15,439
LAURA: Awesome!

2362
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:24,460
MATT: All right. We shall see now at this point.
So, at this point, I want you guys all to pick a

2363
02:33:24,460 --> 02:33:26,068
card, see where you're at.

2364
02:33:26,068 --> 02:33:28,714
TRAVIS: Don't even need to shuffle it.

2365
02:33:28,714 --> 02:33:35,213
LAURA: I'm going to choose the one second to the
left. Oh, he's shuffling, I saw the king.

2366
02:33:35,213 --> 02:33:40,450
LIAM: This one's the good one on top. Five of
clubs.

2367
02:33:40,450 --> 02:33:42,186
LAURA: Did we get a straight? What'd you get?

2368
02:33:42,186 --> 02:33:43,079
TRAVIS: Nine.

2369
02:33:43,079 --> 02:33:43,885
MARISHA: Four.

2370
02:33:43,885 --> 02:33:44,891
LAURA: Aw, so close.

2371
02:33:44,891 --> 02:33:45,694
LIAM: Mediocre as hell.

2372
02:33:45,694 --> 02:33:51,529
MATT: Immediately, at the top of this round, you
have the nine. You watch as, as you're preparing

2373
02:33:51,529 --> 02:33:57,944
yourself for this moment, Cy hits the ground on
all fours, shirt begins to tear, his fur bursts

2374
02:33:57,944 --> 02:34:03,150
out of his back, and all of a sudden his mouth
extends, teeth and it seems like an endless supply

2375
02:34:03,150 --> 02:34:07,620
of saliva dripping onto the ground. (roars) You're
up first.

2376
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:13,235
TRAVIS: Well, once more into the (deep voice)
fucking breach. I throw both bowie knives that I

2377
02:34:13,235 --> 02:34:16,970
have in my sleeves, and I tear after him, just run
at him, both knives out.

2378
02:34:16,970 --> 02:34:20,787
MATT: You get right into his area. Go ahead and
roll. Are you going to attack with both of them?

2379
02:34:20,787 --> 02:34:23,345
So two attacks at minus two each.

2380
02:34:23,345 --> 02:34:27,524
LIAM: You're still skinny as fuck, though, right?
(high-pitched battle cry)

2381
02:34:27,524 --> 02:34:36,379
TRAVIS: Matt, I'm going to reroll this one. I'll
leave that there. Okay, so that's six. And I would

2382
02:34:36,379 --> 02:34:38,666
like to add a blue chip.

2383
02:34:38,666 --> 02:34:43,931
MATT: Okay, here, have one back. Everybody gets a
blue chip.

2384
02:34:43,931 --> 02:34:45,403
(cheering)

2385
02:34:45,403 --> 02:34:47,089
MARISHA: Yeah, to whoever did that.

2386
02:34:47,089 --> 02:34:48,793
LAURA: Thanks, guys!

2387
02:34:48,793 --> 02:34:52,409
TRAVIS: Can I add more than one chip to a roll?

2388
02:34:52,409 --> 02:34:53,964
MATT: For right now? Sure.

2389
02:34:53,964 --> 02:34:55,483
TRAVIS: I can send it back.

2390
02:34:55,483 --> 02:35:02,269
MATT: Blue chip to Marisha and a red chip to
Travis.

2391
02:35:02,269 --> 02:35:04,633
TRAVIS: So that's 16 total.

2392
02:35:04,633 --> 02:35:06,823
MATT: One of each to Marisha.

2393
02:35:06,823 --> 02:35:08,991
LIAM: Opa, opa, opa.

2394
02:35:08,991 --> 02:35:19,463
MATT: Travis, what are you doing? 16 total for the
first hit? Okay.

2395
02:35:19,463 --> 02:35:23,755
TRAVIS: Well, actually, I thought I was just doing
one, so. Hey, I guess I did all that on the first hit.

2396
02:35:23,755 --> 02:35:28,719
MATT: So that definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage with an additional d6.

2397
02:35:28,719 --> 02:35:35,417
TRAVIS: Okay, an additional d6. Six. Ten.

2398
02:35:35,417 --> 02:35:44,897
MATT: Ten. All righty. You go ahead and strike
down with the blade, jamming it across the front

2399
02:35:44,897 --> 02:35:51,538
of the werewolf's form. It roars, you can see the
exposed wound in itself. It seems to be taken

2400
02:35:51,538 --> 02:35:53,907
aback and shaken, but nothing directly beyond
that.

2401
02:35:53,907 --> 02:35:56,146
TRAVIS: My second bowie knife.

2402
02:35:56,146 --> 02:36:00,734
MATT: Go for it. The small bear named Trinket, by
the way, just begins to slowly hump your leg,

2403
02:36:00,734 --> 02:36:02,221
distracting you momentarily.

2404
02:36:02,221 --> 02:36:03,823
LAURA: What? Why the fuck?

2405
02:36:03,823 --> 02:36:10,190
TRAVIS: That was a five. That's nine.

2406
02:36:10,190 --> 02:36:17,246
MATT: Nine. Black chip to Laura. Inspired,
apparently, by the small bear coming to

2407
02:36:17,246 --> 02:36:20,673
adolescence. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2408
02:36:20,673 --> 02:36:28,924
TRAVIS: I'm going to reroll that. That was short.
I can't believe I shorted it. That was even worse.

2409
02:36:28,924 --> 02:36:30,364
That was a one.

2410
02:36:30,364 --> 02:36:33,775
MATT: Total one. With the plus two?

2411
02:36:33,775 --> 02:36:35,626
TRAVIS: Oh, with the plus two is three.

2412
02:36:35,626 --> 02:36:39,203
MATT: Three. This one strikes through. Does
nothing. You can see it hits the flesh and tears

2413
02:36:39,203 --> 02:36:44,608
across, not able to pierce the outside of this
hardened werewolf exterior. All right, ending your

2414
02:36:44,608 --> 02:36:46,666
turn, anyone have five or lower?

2415
02:36:46,666 --> 02:36:47,968
LIAM: I had a five.

2416
02:36:47,968 --> 02:36:50,481
MATT: All right, you and the wolf go at the same
time.

2417
02:36:50,481 --> 02:36:54,236
LAURA: Did Trinket humping me make me not get to
go?

2418
02:36:54,236 --> 02:36:58,591
MATT: Oh, you had an eight. Okay, sorry, so you're
going next.

2419
02:36:58,591 --> 02:37:05,870
LAURA: Hah! I want to shoot it. I'm going to shoot
the werewolf bear creature. All right.

2420
02:37:05,870 --> 02:37:08,825
LIAM: You fucking smell like balls.

2421
02:37:08,825 --> 02:37:16,099
LAURA: I do. I'm going to fan my hammer again,
man. I'm going to reroll the first one.

2422
02:37:16,099 --> 02:37:20,978
LIAM: They're blessed, they're blessed! Plus four
to--

2423
02:37:20,978 --> 02:37:25,342
LAURA: That's seven. Oh, so three on the first
hit, which probably doesn't hit.

2424
02:37:25,342 --> 02:37:26,631
MATT: Three misses.

2425
02:37:26,631 --> 02:37:27,826
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

2426
02:37:27,826 --> 02:37:33,531
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies, yeah! Go, Laura,
go!

2427
02:37:33,531 --> 02:37:41,811
LAURA: So eight, eight, nine on the next ones.
Nine on the one after that, so I've got one more.

2428
02:37:41,811 --> 02:37:44,478
Nine-- no, that's a six, damn it.

2429
02:37:44,478 --> 02:37:46,624
MATT: Five hit.

2430
02:37:46,624 --> 02:37:48,248
LAURA: Okay. All right.

2431
02:37:48,248 --> 02:37:49,480
LIAM: Plus four on the damage.

2432
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:53,346
DONATION PROMPT: All right!

2433
02:37:53,346 --> 02:37:54,874
LIAM: That's what I said.

2434
02:37:54,874 --> 02:38:13,926
LAURA: 12 plus five is 17, plus five, actually. 17
plus five is 22 on the first one. 11 on the second

2435
02:38:13,926 --> 02:38:42,499
one. 11 on the third. 18 on the next one. Oh my
god. 15, no, 17 on the next one. Do I get one more

2436
02:38:42,499 --> 02:38:49,195
hit? Eight on the last one.

2437
02:38:49,195 --> 02:39:03,605
MATT: All right. You unload, bullets blasting into
the werewolf's body. You see it seems like almost

2438
02:39:03,605 --> 02:39:05,559
none of the wounds have slowed it down.

2439
02:39:05,559 --> 02:39:07,109
LAURA: Oh my god. I'm going to reload.

2440
02:39:07,109 --> 02:39:11,847
MATT: You reload your weapon with your quick
reload. All right, ending your turn, now it's your go.

2441
02:39:11,847 --> 02:39:14,910
LAURA: I'm going to back away from it, too.

2442
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:22,240
LIAM: I want to bless the crucifix that I'm
holding and attack, which I can do, right? Does

2443
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:23,748
that work?

2444
02:39:23,748 --> 02:39:29,308
MATT: Yeah. It'll be minus two to your attacks.
That's to Marisha, actually.

2445
02:39:29,308 --> 02:39:32,299
LAURA: Damn, Marisha.

2446
02:39:32,299 --> 02:39:35,013
MARISHA: Are we trying to end the game at one
minute?

2447
02:39:35,013 --> 02:39:38,813
LIAM: So five is what I roll for
that--

2448
02:39:38,813 --> 02:39:46,452
LAURA: Wait, we don't get to finish the game?

2449
02:39:46,452 --> 02:39:48,403
MATT: We'll finish it, don't worry.

2450
02:39:48,403 --> 02:39:58,640
LIAM: All right, eight on the faith. And then the
attack is what gets gunked, right? Four minus two,

2451
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:06,827
plus four, so six for the stab to the eye.

2452
02:40:06,827 --> 02:40:14,319
MATT: You swing, and it actually grabs your hand,
catches it in the air, pulls you right in towards

2453
02:40:14,319 --> 02:40:16,753
its jaws. What are you doing?

2454
02:40:16,753 --> 02:40:22,133
MARISHA: I'm going to start walking up to it, and
I'm going to say, tonight is the night that you

2455
02:40:22,133 --> 02:40:27,712
die, and I'm going to attempt to shaken it with my
persuasion thing.

2456
02:40:27,712 --> 02:40:30,127
LIAM: (hiccups)

2457
02:40:30,127 --> 02:40:51,014
MARISHA: Because I have it, this I get to just add
a d6 to the roll, right? Fucking fuck. Ooh, 11

2458
02:40:51,014 --> 02:40:53,577
plus another five, so that's 16.

2459
02:40:53,577 --> 02:41:03,618
MATT: 16, okay. As you say this to the wolf, who's
holding the preacher in his face, it appears to be

2460
02:41:03,618 --> 02:41:07,342
still in the same shaken state that it was
previously, its eyes darting around.

2461
02:41:07,342 --> 02:41:08,679
MARISHA: How far away am I from it?

2462
02:41:08,679 --> 02:41:10,014
MATT: You're about 30 feet.

2463
02:41:10,014 --> 02:41:16,088
MARISHA: Can I walk up to it and make it?

2464
02:41:16,088 --> 02:41:17,258
MATT: What's your speed?

2465
02:41:17,258 --> 02:41:18,359
MARISHA: 20 paces.

2466
02:41:18,359 --> 02:41:26,371
MATT: Nope. Peg leg. You're getting closer, but not close
enough.

2467
02:41:26,371 --> 02:41:28,180
MARISHA: You're going to die.

2468
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:35,521
MATT: As you finish that, E.B. Farnum pulls out his
gun, with the other two guys who have their

2469
02:41:35,521 --> 02:41:38,485
pistols ready, and they unload upon you guys.

2470
02:41:38,485 --> 02:41:42,736
LAURA: Oh shit. Is there anything to duck behind?
Probably should've done that.

2471
02:41:42,736 --> 02:41:56,764
MATT: Okay. That's a hit to you from E.B., who
says, "I like my hat better!" That's going to be

2472
02:41:56,764 --> 02:42:01,325
an eight. Nine. What's your toughness?

2473
02:42:01,325 --> 02:42:02,360
TRAVIS: Five.

2474
02:42:02,360 --> 02:42:08,312
MATT: Yeah, so that's going to be four over.
That's a raise. You take a wound, which you

2475
02:42:08,312 --> 02:42:15,152
haven't been healed since the last one, have you?
So you're now at two wounds. Oh wait, that was a

2476
02:42:15,152 --> 02:42:21,114
raise, 'cause you were already shaken, so that's
three wounds. You go right down. You just get shot

2477
02:42:21,114 --> 02:42:24,596
in the chest and fall to the ground, and you're
bleeding out now.

2478
02:42:24,596 --> 02:42:27,192
TRAVIS: (deep voice) Well, ain't that some fucking
shit.

2479
02:42:27,192 --> 02:42:32,249
MATT: The two other gunmen go ahead and start
firing at you and you, being the scariest ones at

2480
02:42:32,249 --> 02:42:41,024
that. That's going to be, yeah, with the range
here. You get hit, and you, I'm going to go ahead

2481
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:42,631
and add six to that.

2482
02:42:42,631 --> 02:42:43,698
MARISHA: No, you're not!

2483
02:42:43,698 --> 02:42:44,816
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

2484
02:42:44,816 --> 02:42:45,798
MARISHA: No.

2485
02:42:45,798 --> 02:42:49,009
MATT: Okay. Add another six to that.

2486
02:42:49,009 --> 02:42:54,521
MARISHA: That a red? Is not in the cards for you,
my friend.

2487
02:42:54,521 --> 02:42:57,354
TRAVIS: Or we could get a good ending.

2488
02:42:57,354 --> 02:43:09,532
MATT: So the other shot towards you does not hit
you. You, however, do suffer-- that's going to be

2489
02:43:09,532 --> 02:43:14,252
14 points of damage. What's your toughness?

2490
02:43:14,252 --> 02:43:15,927
MARISHA: Four.

2491
02:43:15,927 --> 02:43:27,851
MATT: Yeah, so you're shaken and you take a wound.
You now see Simon from earlier pulls out a deck of

2492
02:43:27,851 --> 02:43:33,713
cards before him, and you see this sparkle of
bluish energy across his fingers as he goes ahead

2493
02:43:33,713 --> 02:43:36,022
and attempts to release a torrent of beams.

2494
02:43:36,022 --> 02:43:37,288
LAURA: I think you suffer two wounds.

2495
02:43:37,288 --> 02:43:40,244
MARISHA: Two wounds or just one wound?

2496
02:43:40,244 --> 02:43:41,697
TRAVIS: Two wounds, because you went ten over.

2497
02:43:41,697 --> 02:43:43,084
LAURA: Yeah, she went ten over.

2498
02:43:43,084 --> 02:43:45,250
MATT: Oh yeah. You were already shaken before,
weren't you?

2499
02:43:45,250 --> 02:43:46,663
MARISHA: No. I shook it off.

2500
02:43:46,663 --> 02:43:59,607
MATT: Shaken and then a wound. You're fine.
However, each of you guys. Hits, hits, you're

2501
02:43:59,607 --> 02:44:04,796
already on the ground. Each of you guys-- what are
your toughnesses?

2502
02:44:04,796 --> 02:44:06,346
LAURA: Five.

2503
02:44:06,346 --> 02:44:09,991
MARISHA: This is Simon doing this? Is he shaken,
though?

2504
02:44:09,991 --> 02:44:15,552
MATT: Simon wasn't shaken. The werewolf is.

2505
02:44:15,552 --> 02:44:18,825
LIAM: Bring us home, Marshal, bring us home.

2506
02:44:18,825 --> 02:44:27,160
MATT: So that's going to be a second wound for
you. That's going to be six. What's your

2507
02:44:27,195 --> 02:44:35,920
toughness? Five. So you are shaken, now. Against
you, that's going to be six. What's your toughness?

2508
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:37,294
LAURA: Five.

2509
02:44:37,294 --> 02:44:43,554
MATT: You're already shaken? You are shaken now.
So, given the circumstances, as they are, you have

2510
02:44:43,554 --> 02:44:49,894
no silver weapons and no silver bullets. The fight
presses on for a few more minutes as you all do

2511
02:44:49,894 --> 02:44:56,923
the best you can to combat this overwhelming
source, but the perpetual spray of bullets in your

2512
02:44:56,923 --> 02:45:02,254
direction eventually puts most of you onto the
ground. And as the wolf tears into your face,

2513
02:45:02,254 --> 02:45:08,954
Stinky Jules, you scream out as the jaws of Cy
Tolliver, now extended into white and bloodied

2514
02:45:08,954 --> 02:45:16,952
fangs, rips the face from your body, taking out
your jugular. You freak out, E.B. Farnum manages

2515
02:45:16,952 --> 02:45:23,196
to get a crack shot that takes off the top half of
your head. You--

2516
02:45:23,196 --> 02:45:25,800
LIAM: Thank you, Lord, for letting me sleep with
two women and a man.

2517
02:45:25,800 --> 02:45:27,723
(laughter)

2518
02:45:27,723 --> 02:45:32,888
MATT: You hear a familiar voice in the back of
your head go, "Yes. You followed the right path."

2519
02:45:32,888 --> 02:45:39,480
And you feel this crackling of flames over your
shoulders before-- as now you realize that this

2520
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:41,490
voice indeed was not leading you down the right
way.

2521
02:45:41,490 --> 02:45:42,639
LIAM: No shit.

2522
02:45:42,639 --> 02:45:44,568
LAURA: What about Trinket? Is he alive?

2523
02:45:44,568 --> 02:45:48,885
MATT: Trinket's over your body now as the werewolf
has let it alone.

2524
02:45:48,885 --> 02:45:49,863
LAURA: Humping?

2525
02:45:49,863 --> 02:45:56,957
MATT: And is just humping your knee as you bleed
out. It's horrible. Time limits.

2526
02:45:56,957 --> 02:45:58,520
LIAM: Wait, flames on my back? What?

2527
02:45:58,520 --> 02:46:05,738
MATT: You feel flames on your back, knowing that
this entity that's been whispering into your

2528
02:46:05,738 --> 02:46:13,816
head is not from your deity. However, the werewolf
walks over, grabs you by the arm, and lifts you

2529
02:46:13,816 --> 02:46:23,526
back onto your feet. Turns back toward you, the
preacher, and goes, "Do what you're meant to do.

2530
02:46:23,526 --> 02:46:34,452
"Cy commands it." You watch as the visage of the
fantastic Sydney dissipates, and in his place, now

2531
02:46:34,452 --> 02:46:41,323
standing before you instead, is a humanoid
cat-like tiger creature with two backwards hands.

2532
02:46:41,323 --> 02:46:43,280
(laughter)

2533
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:44,693
LIAM: Thanks, chat!

2534
02:46:44,693 --> 02:46:46,528
MARISHA: Thanks, chat. Thank you for that.

2535
02:46:46,528 --> 02:46:53,691
TRAVIS: Oh, I hated that fucking accent anyway. I
want to see what you look like on the inside. And

2536
02:46:53,691 --> 02:46:58,261
I shove a blade right under his belly button and
open him up from bottom to top.

2537
02:46:58,261 --> 02:47:01,587
MATT: You pray as hard as you can to your deity,
but the pain is too hard, but you can't help but

2538
02:47:01,587 --> 02:47:04,777
scream out in horrible agony as you are gutted
like a fish--

2539
02:47:04,777 --> 02:47:06,418
LIAM: We call him Jesus, but.

2540
02:47:06,418 --> 02:47:09,394
(laughter)

2541
02:47:09,394 --> 02:47:12,299
MATT: Yeah, there are multiple deities in this
world.

2542
02:47:12,299 --> 02:47:19,214
LIAM: Hey, there's one god, clearly one god,
clearly.

2543
02:47:19,214 --> 02:47:25,375
MATT: And he's helped you a lot tonight. As you
are gutted in the full moonlight, you hear the

2544
02:47:25,375 --> 02:47:34,044
chuckle of Cy Tolliver with his somewhat nervous
allies, evening falling darker still on the future

2545
02:47:34,044 --> 02:47:42,007
of Deadwood here, amongst the reckoning. You guys
got wrecked.

2546
02:47:42,007 --> 02:47:44,139
TRAVIS: Yeah, Deadlands!

2547
02:47:44,139 --> 02:47:49,532
(cheering)

2548
02:47:49,532 --> 02:47:51,919
TRAVIS: I'm alive! Murdering another day.

2549
02:47:51,919 --> 02:47:55,754
LIAM: R-E-K-T, rekt.

2550
02:47:55,754 --> 02:48:03,961
MATT: That was rough. Yeah, going after it without
the silver bullets or using the silver to armor

2551
02:48:03,961 --> 02:48:05,787
up, there was no way.

2552
02:48:05,787 --> 02:48:08,563
LAURA: We didn't have time for it.

2553
02:48:08,563 --> 02:48:11,807
LIAM: Where's the silver bullets? We don't got a
smelting machine.

2554
02:48:11,807 --> 02:48:15,009
MATT: Somebody to smelt it.

2555
02:48:15,009 --> 02:48:18,208
MARISHA: Well, we only had five minutes left in
the stream.

2556
02:48:18,208 --> 02:48:21,913
TRAVIS: Oh, excuses, excuses, dead people.

2557
02:48:21,913 --> 02:48:30,697
LAURA: Man. That was a fun game. What did we get
to?

2558
02:48:30,697 --> 02:48:32,839
OFF-SCREEN: Over $71,000.

2559
02:48:32,839 --> 02:48:35,755
(cheering)

2560
02:48:35,755 --> 02:48:46,687
OFF-SCREEN: We still have a little bit more stream
going, just to end it off, so looking like if we

2561
02:48:46,687 --> 02:48:50,506
get to $75,000, should we still give them the
75,000 goals that we had, including the--

2562
02:48:50,506 --> 02:48:56,382
TRAVIS: Absolutely. Yeah, 100%.

2563
02:48:56,382 --> 02:49:03,438
OFF-SCREEN: And they can commemorate this chat,
because these are still available.

2564
02:49:03,438 --> 02:49:09,244
MATT: You guys did an amazing job. Thank you so
much for tuning into this absolute chaos and adding to it.

2565
02:49:09,244 --> 02:49:13,225
MARISHA: And 100% of the proceeds from those
shirts are going to the MDA.

2566
02:49:13,225 --> 02:49:15,537
LIAM: Thank you for donating. Thank you.

2567
02:49:15,537 --> 02:49:19,128
LAURA: You guys are amazing. Thanks for all the
chips.

2568
02:49:19,128 --> 02:49:21,942
MARISHA: I wish I had a few more minutes to wreak
havoc.

2569
02:49:21,942 --> 02:49:23,427
LAURA: I know, right?

2570
02:49:23,427 --> 02:49:25,970
MARISHA: Just a few more is all I needed.

2571
02:49:25,970 --> 02:49:30,250
MATT: You know what, you saved a few people in
town. They'll probably inevitably be destroyed by

2572
02:49:30,250 --> 02:49:31,770
the incursion of Cy Tolliver--

2573
02:49:31,770 --> 02:49:32,795
LAURA: Eventually, yeah.

2574
02:49:32,795 --> 02:49:34,487
MARISHA: That was fun.

2575
02:49:34,487 --> 02:49:39,162
MATT: This is a lot of spoilers for the Deadwood
movie coming up, by the way. They have to compete

2576
02:49:39,162 --> 02:49:43,310
with Supernatural and Walking Dead, so they're
just throwing werewolves in.

2577
02:49:43,310 --> 02:49:50,990
LAURA: My throat hurts from talking like Stinky
Jules the whole time. All right!

2578
02:49:50,990 --> 02:49:53,253
TRAVIS: Caught what she caught, huh?

2579
02:49:53,253 --> 02:49:57,670
MARISHA: What's happening now?

2580
02:49:57,670 --> 02:50:02,153
MATT: Nice, that's fantastic. You guys have raised
such an incredible amount of money. Thank you so

2581
02:50:02,153 --> 02:50:06,250
much for tuning in and being so generous and
helping this amazing cause. We're going to go

2582
02:50:06,250 --> 02:50:10,357
ahead and prep you guys for the next bit of
entertainment closing up the rest of this charity

2583
02:50:10,357 --> 02:50:16,747
stream. See if we can hit that 75k goal. That
would be incredible. Thank you for making my first

2584
02:50:16,747 --> 02:50:22,802
foray into the chaos of Savage Worlds what it was,
though I'm pretty sure it usually doesn't involve

2585
02:50:22,802 --> 02:50:27,681
so many fate chips and a lot of-- there was a lot
of intrigue we didn't hear that just got thrown

2586
02:50:27,681 --> 02:50:32,081
out the window as soon as shit started happening.
That's okay. That's the nature of these wonderful

2587
02:50:32,081 --> 02:50:35,293
games. Guys, thank you so much. We're going to go
ahead and clean up here and prepare for your next

2588
02:50:35,293 --> 02:50:41,393
performance, and yeah. We'll see you guys-- you'll
see these guys this coming Thursday, and me and

2589
02:50:41,393 --> 02:50:46,056
Marisha will see you the following Thursday for
the next episode of Critical Role. Lots of love, guys.

2590
02:50:46,056 --> 02:50:47,810
TRAVIS: Thank you!
