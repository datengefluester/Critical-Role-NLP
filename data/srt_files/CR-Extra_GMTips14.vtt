NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.895
MATT: Hello. My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm a
voice actor and the dungeon master for Critical

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:07.957
Role, here at Geek &amp; Sundry, and welcome to
today's episode of GM Tips, where we discuss

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:10.797
fixing GM mistakes.

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:16.235
[music]

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:21.146
MATT: Being the game master for an entire world,
guiding heroic players through stories from inside

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:26.688
your mind, can be an incredibly fun and rewarding
experience. However, you are not infallible.

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:32.130
Mistakes do happen. Perhaps a misinterpreted note
led to a conflict in story resolution, or an NPC

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.235
you designed to be integral ends up killed by the
party, you let slip a tiny tidbit of secret info

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:42.406
that undermines your big reveal, or you gift a
player with an item that is far too powerful than

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:45.855
you thought, throwing party in-game balance
entirely out of whack.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:49.995
How do you correct these unintentional errors to
maintain the game you want to run? Well, let's

00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:52.406
discuss a number of solutions to these
challenges.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:55.925
Let's say you're running an encounter that isn't
intended to be that difficult. Either you

00:00:55.925 --> 00:01:00.757
miscalculated the power of the enemies or the luck
was so against the party that a whimpering,

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:06.598
anticlimactic TPK is imminent. Here some examples
of how to correct that situation. You could

00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:11.205
suddenly have an arrow or spell fly in from out of
nowhere, rocking one of the more dangerous foes,

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:15.996
and have an allied NPC enter the fray to save them
from the claws of defeat. You could also consider

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:20.417
that if it's an intelligent foe, perhaps they see
the PCs' terrible situation and see them worth

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:25.737
more alive and enslaved than dead. Have them fight
not to the death, and instead knock them

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:30.457
unconscious or force them to their knees and swear
themselves to the foe. This could even lead to a

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:35.435
cool escape or revenge-type mission in the near
future. You could also have a terrible, screeching

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:39.827
roar blast across the sky, and your enemies
suddenly look more frightened than they've ever

00:01:39.827 --> 00:01:44.544
been before. They quickly assess their
situation, decide to flee, leaving you to the fate

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:48.826
of some possibly scarier creature. The wounded
party now has to hide from this mystery creature

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:54.185
to survive. Or you could just have them TPK and
explain how the darkness-- or the light, possibly,

00:01:54.185 --> 00:02:00.496
as well-- fades as they awaken in a stone room,
shackled and held down. Suddenly, it appears that

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:05.176
a powerful mage has resurrected the party. Who
knows what plans he has for them? All he knows is

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:11.437
that they are a party of skilled heroes and they
have utility for such a powerful mage. (chuckles)

00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:16.676
Now, mind you, if the encounter is intended to be
dangerous, challenging, and possibly deadly, let

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:21.818
the dice fall as it may. That's part of the
game. You don't want to undermine the ever-present

00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:26.818
danger and tension of the game. However, you also
don't want to completely end the story that you

00:02:26.818 --> 00:02:32.135
and your players have put into for months and months
due to just an unexpectedly shitty scenario.

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:36.059
Another situation is you've given clues and
information and hints as to where to discover and

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:40.448
follow the main plot, but no one is figuring it
out or picking up on your nudges. The game is

00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:44.959
quite literally going nowhere. Don't be afraid to
be a little more blunt with your additional

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.227
information. While some hints may seem like
obvious reveals to you, you also already have all

00:02:50.227 --> 00:02:54.425
the information in your head. A PC getting these
hints in a vacuum might end up either completely

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:59.917
confused or misinterpret the vague info and
extrapolate an entirely new and entirely wrong

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:06.129
plot. If it goes on too long, drop more direct
hints via NPCs they encounter, or have more clues

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.247
found as they go, or just reveal information as
part of the terrain as they progress forward.

00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:16.108
You can tailor and reshuffle your intended plot
points and plot NPCs to be a little more direct

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:21.415
with their info, or even appear in unintended,
more convenient areas if the PCs aren't as focused

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:25.768
or driven as you expected. Moving the plot along
for everyone's benefit is more important than

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:29.947
adhering to a theoretical structure that you
created in your own little headspace.

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:33.537
Here's another example of a situation: you've
offered information about your plot throughout the

00:03:33.537 --> 00:03:37.978
game, and the players discover an accidental,
fairly large contradiction in your storytelling

00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:43.097
that confuses them or undermines your entire
plot's direction. First off, let them discuss the

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:48.000
confusion while you consider options and how to
retroactively disprove one side of that info. Pick

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.949
which side of the plot conflict is more
interesting to pursue, and let them seek answers

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.685
in-game as to which side is false. Perhaps an ally
who provided some of the info can now be revealed

00:03:56.685 --> 00:04:02.398
to be a saboteur or a mole, or information was
planted by an unseen antagonistic force trying to

00:04:02.398 --> 00:04:03.707
throw off the scent.

00:04:03.707 --> 00:04:08.167
No reveal is immediately necessary. You can stall
for time between sessions to unravel your mistake

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:10.488
and make it work for you as opposed to against
you.

00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:15.196
Another possibility is you accidentally spill a
lead, like an info leak or secret about your main

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:19.807
plot and spoil a grand surprise you'd been
looking forward to dropping down the road. First

00:04:19.807 --> 00:04:23.778
off, don't admit the mistake. Own it. Let the
party think you intentionally did so and follow

00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:28.077
their lead. If needed, take a break shortly
thereafter, or, if possible, even between

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:32.294
sessions, and brainstorm a way to alter your
current story to enhance the reveal, or even

00:04:32.294 --> 00:04:36.506
change it to be a bait-and-switch so you can still
surprise them later on. If it was indeed info

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:41.116
revealed by an NPC, you can also have that NPC
feed them a bunch of additional misinformation to

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:45.317
confuse the players into perhaps not believing
anything they've said. You can later play out that

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:50.164
they were either not in their right mind, like being
mentally controlled by some crazy witchcraft, or

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:54.404
perhaps a doppelganger trying to misinform the
party. Doppelgangers are always fun. Make your

00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:56.221
party real nervous. Trust no one.

00:04:56.221 --> 00:05:00.381
If the reveal was largely due to a very clever
player connecting the dots, don't punish them for

00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:04.771
being clever. Let them enjoy that victory. Just do
your best to not show any confirmation of their

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:09.301
deduction until it's put into action, leaving them
to possibly second-guess their own idea in the

00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:15.082
interim. Then, if they stick to it, reward them. I
mean, few moments for a PC really beat figuring

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:18.733
out the villain's plot and watching it unfold
accordingly. Unless there's nothing they can do to

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:22.552
stop the plot, and they're fucked, in which
case, (nervous laugh).

00:05:22.552 --> 00:05:28.822
Another mistake-based situation may involve you
giving a magical item or items to the party that

00:05:28.822 --> 00:05:33.392
quickly appear to be way more powerful than you
anticipated. It completely wrecks your intended

00:05:33.392 --> 00:05:38.111
game balance and can sometime cause the other PCs
to resent that unfair advantage that player now

00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:42.442
has. Well, here are some suggested ways to handle
fixing that scenario. You could perhaps introduce

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:47.852
a very powerful entity who lost that magical item
or object and has been actively seeking it. They

00:05:47.852 --> 00:05:53.550
stumble upon the PCs and offer, in exchange for
the item, other grand rewards and the favor of a

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.035
powerful being that they can keep in mind for
future use. Or the item can slowly be revealed to

00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:03.280
be cursed: the longer they use it, the more
dangerous or penalizing it becomes. Now they must

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.763
quest to cleanse it, and while doing so lessens
its abilities, in the end, it can now be used

00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:10.492
without issue, and they've earned that item's true
use.

00:06:10.492 --> 00:06:14.782
Another way would be: perhaps the enchantment was
unstable due to strange, arcane experiments and

00:06:14.782 --> 00:06:20.300
the item shatters. It must now be reforged using
safer components, which produces a comparable, if

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.523
possibly lessened version that lasts indefinitely.
Or, by the time they repair the item, the party

00:06:25.523 --> 00:06:28.879
has reached a power level where it seems to befit
the current game balance.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:33.070
Not all these options are possible, and there are
many other awesome possibilities you can use to

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.712
fix these issues that you can find and research
online, but I hope these tips have at least been

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:40.472
somewhat helpful if one of these scenarios does
find its way into your campaign.

00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:44.593
Thank you so much for watching. My name is Matthew
Mercer. You can find more GM Tips here at
