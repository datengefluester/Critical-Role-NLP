Raishan took the corpse of Thordak\u2014apparently via teleportation\u2014as well as two of the eggs that remained in the lair, and vanished.\n\"Upon wrestling [their] way outside of the lair itself, [the party] came upon a number of allies who had fought their way to the center of the city, as well as Patrick's character Kerrek, who had brought a number of his ragtag adventurers from the city of Westruun to aid. Kerrek joined [Vox Machina] in [their] return to Whitestone and has now agreed to aid [them] in [their] search for the current whereabouts of Raishan.\n\"Through the use of some rather rapid Scry magic, and the dragon's spent capability to defend against it at the time, [they] found the location of Raishan, apparently a distant island to the far south in the Lucidian Ocean, one that once was the lair of Thordak before he was sealed, and before that, apparently, belonged to a necromancer named Opaash.\n\"[Vox Machina] then spent [...] the day in Whitestone preparing to rest for coming conflict, giving chase to Raishan in hopes of stopping whatever her plans are before they come to fruition.\""
