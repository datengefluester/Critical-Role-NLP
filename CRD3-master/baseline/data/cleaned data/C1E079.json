Utilizing aid from the Ashari people to cover the skies as the armies began to assault the outer walls, [Vox Machina] along with Zahra, Kashaw, Jarett, Gilmore \u2014the whole party, everyone's there\u2014 Kima \u2014 Drake staying back with the army to help them with the assault.\n\"[They] made their way underneath, through the sewer system, made a brief alliance with some wayward Clasp who led [them] to the center of town where the volcanic essence of Thordak's mutated draconic form has been pulling volcanic activity up beneath the city. [They] climbed up on top, and there at the walled gates to the central Cloudtop District, which Thordak now calls his home and his lair, [they] saw two fire giants guarding the entrance. Kashaw and Zahra, in a heroic display, bound the giants in place and decided to take care of them while [Vox Machina] rushed into the fray, bursting through the door due to the strength of [ Grog's] Titanstone Gauntlets.\n\"[Vox Machina] rushed into the cloud-, smoke-, and ember-filled Cloudtop District ruins, jumping from ruined building to wreck of rubble and stone. The air itself is dense with black and dark fumes, it's hard to see anything. [They] all kind of carefully, gingerly, stealthily made [their] way into the alcove of one ruined building, where across the way [they] see a giant raised central cavern, a hole, a burrow if you will, that is close to forty feet across. Apparently [their] approach was somewhat sensed by the red dragon himself, as [they] watched Thordak emerge from this burrow and climb out, saying to itself, 'It appears we have visitors.'\"\n"
