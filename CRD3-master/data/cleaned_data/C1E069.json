They gave chase down to the Glintshore Island of the Hespet Archipelago, and upon storming the beaches and destroying her ship, they walked into the jungle where an ambush turned into folly. They charged into what appeared to be a couple of illusions as the floor detonated beneath them, sending them across the ground and starting an encounter with snipers in position, at half health and below for most of the party.\n\"They gave a very, very good fight and still managed to push through, unfortunately Dr. Ripley\u2014with the reveal that she has now bound herself to Orthax, the shadow demon that once plagued Percy's inspiration and nightmares\u2014bent on vengeance, managed to take Percy, slay him, and leave him cold on the ground. As a group, Vox Machina did manage to... dissect Dr. Ripley, very aggressively, and get vengeance back for their friend.\"\n"

After bidding farewell to the airship, the group teleports to Whitestone and rushes to Pike at the temple of Sarenrae for a resurrection.   The first attempt fails because something is holding Percy back.   It is revealed to be an enchantment on Ripley's gun.  The second attempt involves impassioned pleas from several party members and, at last, a tearful and fearful Vox Machina manages to resurrect their fallen friend."
