They found themselves finding an ally in the current head\u2014and, for the past four hundred years, head of the city\u2014of Ank'Harel, known as J'mon Sa Ord. They gave the party their allegiance in this endeavor against the Conclave, and presented them with a brass flute that apparently can at least notify them that the aid is required.\n\"After which, the party spent the evening in their tavern after the casino incident, and then went searching for this individual, this Mistress Asharru, who apparently has the Cabal's Ruin, this next Vestige in their journey. Upon checking in her house after having no response for a couple days, they broke inside to find that the home had been attacked as of a week ago, her body left behind, apparently riddled with puncture wounds\u2014seemingly bullet holes, after Percy's inspection\u2014and Cabal's Ruin, the cloak that the party was seeking, is gone.\"\n"
