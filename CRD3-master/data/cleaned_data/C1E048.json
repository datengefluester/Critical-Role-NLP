They returned to the outskirts of a city named Westruun that was very important in their early adventures, to find it\u2014from a distance\u2014partially destroyed by the dragon attack but a couple weeks before, and since taken over by what seems to be the remnants\u2014now swelling in power and size\u2014of Grog's old herd of wandering barbarians and various savages.\n\"Having taken the city by force and ruling it with an iron hand, it was also deemed not the right time to face this foe, and as such the party continued venturing southward in the direction of the Frostweald, where, somewhere at the base of the Stormcrest Mountains, the mate of Osysa \u2014the gynosphinx they had met in Vasselheim \u2014her mate resides somewhere in this vicinity.
