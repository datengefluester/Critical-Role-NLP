They have since acquired a number of allies, made their way to the Fire Plane, the City of Brass, and returned to find Fort Daxio under attack. They managed to defend it, saved a few friends, and returned to Whitestone. It seems like everything is gearing itself towards the final conflict in Emon with Thordak the Cinder King.\n\"Last we left off, they were meeting underneath Whitestone at the Ziggurat with the current-standing council; the war council of both Whitestone and this entire endeavor. With multiple armies to converge on Emon in the coming days, now is their time to relax and plan their next moves.\n"
