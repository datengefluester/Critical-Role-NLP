Upon defeating the [beholder] and making a dramatic escape thanks to Tiberius, back to their home town of Emon, they met with the Council of Tal'Dorei, which they are a part of, to discuss what they should do with this great ancient evil artifact, the Horn of Orcus. The Council discussed it, most of the knowledge seemed to be that it could not or there is no known way to destroy it, and the best means of dealing with it would be to reseal it in a place where it would be safe, forgotten, and hopefully never rediscovered. It was decided amongst the Council that the safest place to do that is on the distant land of Othanzia, where there is a capital city known as Vasselheim. There, supposedly, is the most well-known and holiest and oldest place of Kima's order of worship, of the great platinum dragon Bahamut, of which she is a paladin, and supposedly they have facilities or means of sealing it away. So it was decided that they would send away for a holy container that could contain this evil without any worry of corruption or escape, carry it then via skyship over the ocean to the distant land of Othanzia, to Vasselheim the capital city and seal it away. After which they went on a shopping spree to Gilmore's Glorious Goods, and met everyone's favorite mage and item-creator extraordinaire.\"\n"
