It used to belong to a necromancer and then briefly became the lair of Thordak the Cinder King before his original attack on Tal'Dorei roughly sixteen years ago.\n\"[Vox Machina] then gathered [their] weapons, [their] armor, and [their] reserved strength, and with a couple of allies traversed through teleportation all the way to this island. [They] managed to battle [their] way through a deep dungeon that once this necromancer called his home, going past traps and chasms filled with undead and gravity reversed through magical means.\n\"[They] made [their] way into a small tunnel just past this area into what seemed to split into two sides; behind that, what appeared to be the necromancer's sanctum, some sort of a necrotic laboratory, where [they] discovered there within two of the eggs of Thordak's lair that were taken by Raishan, the corpse of Thordak folded in the corner, and apparently Raishan's female human form currently poring through books and rummaging through what currently appears to be the relatively untouched necropolis chamber.\""
