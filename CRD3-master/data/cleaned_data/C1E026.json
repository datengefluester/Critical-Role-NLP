There was a week of preparation in going to this event to see what the Briarwoods were about. Information was gathered at this banquet, Vax went on his own little adventure into the Briarwoods' room, in which they nearly killed him. The party rushed out to his aid, much violence ensued, the Briarwoods eventually escaped through some sort of magical means that was not uncovered, however they are no longer in the picture. The party was left with a destroyed carriage, a young carriage driver who had his hand shot off by Percy and was then told to the guards to haul off and bring to their Keep, to throw into their cell for further questioning. Uriel was eventually drawn out and confused by the sudden chaos and he requested that Vox Machina return the next morning to go over what has transpired.\n\"The party during this event had encountered a tiefling by the name of Lillith, who was masquerading as one of the servants within the Palace of Tal'Dorei, aided them in the battle, and revealed that she was being hunted by her sisters in a distant land, and revealing herself here essentially opened up her physical presence to be pinpointed and then immediately sought and hunted by whoever was after her. The party then brought her back to the Keep. On the way back, they were encountered by this bounty hunter and this small team of individuals that were coming with him to seek out, capture Lillith and bring her back to her sisters. The party then defended her in this circumstance, brutally murdering two of them, one of which was then raised and sent off as a present to the sisters by Lillith, and one was salvaged, not given an honorable death but sent to find his way somewhere northwest of Emon, possibly towards Vasselheim or wherever else he may find his adventure. They then gave Lillith the opportunity to come stay the night, to rest in the Keep, and they all made their way back to Greyskull Keep for the evening.\"\n"
