They were led into a trap, and a heavy battle took place, one that claimed the life of Percival. The party retrieved his body, took it back to Whitestone, and\u2014through a series of very lucky rolls and imploring his soul to return once freeing it from the devouring jaws of Orthax the shadow demon\u2014he was restored to life.\n\"The celebration was short-lived thus far. After an evening's rest, they were asked by their old ally Seeker Assum to meet him upstairs in Castle Whitestone in the War Room for a very important meeting. Upon arriving around the central table, Assum revealed himself to actually be Raishan, the green dragon and member of the Chroma Conclave, that Vox Machina had not seen since the original attack on Emon, and left them last with the bombshell bit of information that Raishan's here to make an alliance, and\u2014as the party is as well\u2014Raishan is interested in the destruction and downfall of Thordak the Cinder King.\"\n"
