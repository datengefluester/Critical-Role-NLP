You made a tenuous relationship with a member of the Conclave, Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, a green dragon. And after killing the other three members of the Conclave, you went in with armies at your back, Ashari in the sky who laid siege to the city as you snuck beneath the streets of Emon, emerging on the outskirts of the Cloudtop District.\n Through the help of your two allies, Zahra and Kashaw, you managed to bypass two waiting fire giants, push straight into the center of the mostly ruined Cloudtop District where you confronted Thordak, the Cinder King, in his large, swollen, powerful, primordial red dragon form.\n You came prepared with allies at your side. In full power you tore into Thordak and while many blows were sustained on both sides of the fray, Thordak fell in the battlefield. In those moments, as Thordak attempted to retreat into his lair, you, Vax, gave chase and slew the dragon using Whisper in your grasp.\n As a few of you came up behind, Raishan, as well, asked\u2014as part of the accord you made\u2014to be given some time with the corpse of Thordak. It was decided that this was not to be allowed, she was not to be trusted and attack was made on Raishan\u2014though Raishan also had made a few unique choices of her own leading up to it\u2014[and this] has led to a confrontation\u2014in Thordak's lair beneath the city\u2014where you all nearly got your asses handed to you by a well-prepared Raishan.\n However, in the midst of this battle you did summon your ally J'mon Sa Ord there\u2014the leader of Ank'Harel, the distant city on the continent of Marquet, and a brass dragon\u2014who upon arriving in this fray, [with] full health and ready to fight, was enough of a threat to drive Raishan off, in her damaged form, before she could finish you off in the state you were in.\n However, you were then kept at bay by a Wall of Force as Raishan took two of Thordak's strangely existing eggs and flew into a tunnel towards the corpse of Thordak and then disappeared in a flash of purple energy before the wall dropped and you all just arrived, halfway through the tunnel where the corpse of Thordak once lay, to find it missing along with Raishan and the eggs that she had gathered.\"\n"
