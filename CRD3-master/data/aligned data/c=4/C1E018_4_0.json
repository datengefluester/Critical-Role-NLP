Giveaways tonight contain a special care package consisting of D&D books and a photo, all signed by the cast in addition to comics and other goodies. Matt reminds the audience that Vox Machina has been split into two separate groups due to their actions in the previous episode and choosing to join the Slayer's Take instead of going to court, and that joining the first group ( Vex'ahlia, Grog, Percy, and Scanlan) are two guest players for the next two weeks: Felicia Day and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. Orion Acaba gives Matt a mysterious headkiss, to which Matt remarks that this is the best Thursday ever.",
