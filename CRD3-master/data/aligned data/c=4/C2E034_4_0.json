You made your way through the Wuyun Gorge, purchased a few pets, and then eventually found yourselves, for many of you, your first time, at the beach, seeing an ocean, seeing the waves, seeing the sand, and took a little brief bit of time to relish in that experience, eventually making your way to Nicodranas in time for the sunset across the western ocean. You began to notice kind of the workforce that goes through the day, and dwindles to the night, that works alongside the numerous number of ships that come in, and then stay along the wharf, and the various docks in the vicinity. You made your way through the various districts of the city, eventually meeting the fantastic, and long presented mother of Jester, The Ruby of the Sea, Marion Lavorre.",
