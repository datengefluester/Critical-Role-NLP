They've gathered a number of artifacts of old called the Vestiges of the Divergence and recently made allies with one of these dragons: Raishan, the green dragon of the Conclave, apparently interested in revolting against the Conclave's leader, Thordak the Cinder King. A tentative alliance has been forged, and to prove both the stalwartness of that alliance, as well as to further their agenda against the Conclave, they all traveled back to Wildemount, to the ruins of Draconia.",
