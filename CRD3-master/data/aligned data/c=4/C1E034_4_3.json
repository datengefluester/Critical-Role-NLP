Percy helming the de Rolo crest, Vox Machina went around inciting the thoughts of rebellion within the city—not the first, but apparently the one with the most chance of succeeding they've had to this date.

In this chaos, Vox Machina made their way underneath the castle Whitestone, where the Lord and Lady Briarwood currently reside, seeking some sort of project called a Ziggurat.",
